Clinton, Miss. (SatireWire.com) – Promising to save you money on the calls you make the most, MCI today unveiled its new “Friends and Family and FBI” plan, allowing customers to add any branch office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation to their circle of regularly called friends and family. 
“At MCI, we realize you don’t want to pay a lot to report suspicious activity,” said MCI spokesman Mandy Grithway. “Under our new program, all you do is provide us with the phone numbers of the relatives, friends, and field agents you want in your circle, and if they sign up too, you’ll receive up to 25 percent off those calls.
“Whether you’re phoning up to say hello, to plan for the holidays, or just to report an unusual white van cruising around the local reservoir, ‘Friends and Family and FBI’ meets your everyday calling needs,” he added.

Business-To-Unemployment (B2U) Dubbed Next Big Thing,admin,https://www.satirewire.com/business-to-unemployment-b2u-dubbed-next-big-thing/,"
San Jose, Cal. (SatireWire.com) – It’s taken a couple of years for the Next Big Thing in e-business to reveal itself, but after another massive wave of dot-com cutbacks this week, analysts have concluded the Internet is migrating toward a layoff-based business model, which they’re already labeling B2U, or Business-to-Unemployment. 
“Like most true sea changes, we didn’t recognize this one until it was staring us in the face,” said Gartner Group analyst Pam Wallaby, who refused to explain how a sea change can stare one in the face. “But if you look at how aggressively dot-coms have been disintegrating, it’s clear that to be an Internet player today, you have to focus on layoffs.” 
Tim Draper, of venture firm Draper Fisher Jurvetson, asserted that he won’t even look at a new business plan if it doesn’t include a layoff schedule. “We’re still getting proposals from B2B and even B2C entrepreneurs, but I think the ideal startup today has to FLLO,” said Draper, referring to the newly-minted ‘Form-Launch-Lay-Off’ business model “That, to me, is the new definition of a pure-play Internet company.”

Dot-Coms Just Dying to Get Prized OTC Listings,admin,https://www.satirewire.com/dot-coms-just-dying-to-get-prized-otc-listings/,"







New York, N.Y. (SatireWire.com) – In an emerging trend analysts are comparing to the IPO mania of 1998-1999, publicly-traded Internet companies are leaving the Nasdaq in a mad rush to have their struggling shares listed instead on the obscure Over-the-Counter stock market, a difficult but not impossible task achieved by strategically failing to meet minimum Nasdaq requirements. 
Executives at dot-coms such as Beyond.com and DrKoop denied they were purposely underachieving, but so far, analysts aren’t buying their arguments. “Look at how these companies spend and lose money, the way they just happen to let their stock prices fall below the $1 minimum necessary to stay on the Nasdaq,” said PaineWebber analyst Kevin Krieger. “They can deny it, but it’s obvious to everyone they’re just dying to get on the OTC.” 
 In fact, Krieger estimates that by 2002, more than 80 percent of dot-coms will attempt the heady jump from the Nasdaq to the OTC. Asked why, Krieger pointed out that unlike a Nasdaq-listed firm, an OTC company avoids interruptions and attention from analysts, the press, investors, and other companies, he said. In addition, it can see its stock trade “many hundreds” of shares in a single day

Astana, Kazakhstan (SatireWire.com) – After yesterday’s explosion of the Russian rocket sponsored by Pizza Hut, (see story), the Russian Space Agency this morning launched its backup rocket, sponsored by Dominoes, but the vehicle and its pilot, 17-year-old high school dropout Nick Turley, are already two hours late and apparently lost. Said cosmonaut Uri Petrovic, who is impatiently waiting for the rocket aboard the international space station: “The guy called twice for directions. It’s probably cold anyway.

Washington, D.C. (SatireWire.com) – In a new Gallup poll on the dehumanizing aspects of job loss, nearly 85 percent of the nation’s 2.96 million unemployed said they “agreed somewhat” or “agreed strongly” with the statement, “I am not just some mind-numbing statistic.” 
“I think what we found quite interesting was that the overwhelming majority of respondents, 75 percent, said they were genuinely hurt by efforts to categorize and compartmentalize their difficulties,” said Gallup researcher Evan Krest. “This was particularly true of women between the ages of 30 and 49, and men who have been unemployed for six months or more.”
But the most empirically moving answers, Krest added, were given by the 62 percent who said they hoped the study would finally put a human face on their anonymous plight.
“One 18-to-29-year-old woman said she was a real person with a real name and real problems that could not possibly be adequately conveyed using cold-blooded numbers,” he recalled. “Unfortunately, her responses were within the margin of error of plus- or minus-3 percent, so she didn’t count.”

New York, N.Y. (SatireWire.com) – In a surprise concession, the Internet Advertising Bureau today acknowledged the banner ad is dead, but expressed confidence that its latest innovation, “Sponsorship Rectangles,” will spread quickly and reignite online advertising. 
According to the IAB, the Sponsorship Rectangle is a radically new marketing concept that allows companies to “sponsor” individual Web pages by placing special “company messages” in a 468×60-pixel rectangle atop each page. These messages can be used to promote a product, company, or event, and can even be “animated” to draw attention to the sponsor. 
“Basically, we told our member ad agencies to throw out the banner ad concept and start from scratch,” explained IAB spokesman Tim Turpin. “I think it’s fair to say that they rose to the challenge just as you would expect.”

"Telecom Merger Will Create First ""Single Phone Company""",admin,https://www.satirewire.com/telecom-merger-will-create-first-single-phone-company/,"







San Antonio, Texas (SatireWire.com) – In a landmark decision expected to create an unprecedented “single, nationwide phone company,” a federal judge yesterday approved the merger of BellSouth, SBC, Sprint, Verizon, MCI, Qwest and 40 other communications firms. The combined company, which would become America’s first “sole provider” of local and long-distance service, will go by the new name of “American Telephone & Telegraph.” 
“Historically, we have forced people to choose from among several phone different companies and pricing plans, which is confusing and anti-consumer,” wrote Judge Thomas Akers. “Entrusting all service to a massive, single company – a mother figure, if you will – seems like something we at least ought to try.”
Analysts, however, warned the concept of a single phone company is untested, and speculated such a firm would meet several obstacles. “For instance, if you have just one phone company, it has to service the entire nation all by itself without any competition,” said IDG telecom analyst Fenton Frederick. “Without knowing what prices competitors charge, how will it know what to charge?”
Responded new American Telephone & Telegraph CEO Charles Lee: “Oh, I’m sure we’ll manage.”

Murray Hill, N.J. (SatireWire.com) – In the most hopeful sign yet that the American economy may be returning to normal, Lucent Technologies posted another staggering quarterly loss on Tuesday. 
Lucent CEO Henry Schacht said posting the $8.8 billion net loss, its fourth consecutive quarterly deficit, proves that terrorists have not been totally successful in disrupting the American way of life. 
“We’ve said for months that we would lose money, again. Everyone expected us to lose money, again, and despite everything that’s happened, we did it,” Schacht boasted. “I think it’s a good message for everybody: if we let the terrorists change our normal routines, if we allow them to change the way we function, then they win. Well not this time.”

Net Company to Hold Second IPO,admin,https://www.satirewire.com/net-company-to-hold-second-ipo/,"
San Francisco (SatireWire.com) – PeoplePC, whose initial public offering bombed last month, said today its first IPO shouldn’t count, and urged investors to return their shares so the company can try again. 
“Let’s do best two out of three,” said company CEO Nick Grouf, who watched shares fall from $10 to just below $9 on opening day. 
Grouf promised his firm would do better next time, and dismissed suggestions that the drop was the result of PeoplePC’s questionable business model. The company sells Internet access and PCs to members for $24.95 a month. According to Grouf, the model played a role, but the real problem was an erroneous offering price. “Considering that we fell 11 percent, pricing at $10 was clearly a mistake,” he said. “We should have priced at $20. That way, we’d be sitting at nearly $18.” 
“Yes in fact, I do have an MBA,” Grouf added. “Why?”

Astana, Kazakhstan (SatireWire.com) – The Pizza Hut-sponsored Russian rocket carrying international space station equipment exploded while in orbit today, just days after its launch. Russian Space Agency officials immediately blamed the proton rocket’s “thin, crunchy crust,” insisting they had ordered a deep dish Pan Proton rocket, which is thicker. Pizza Hut officials, however, argued the Russians could only afford the Thin ‘n Crispy®. “If they were so concerned, they shouldn’t have ordered the mushrooms and black olives,” said company spokesman Rick Cavella. “That was $20 million extra.”
On a brighter note, Cavella pointed out that Earth’s upper atmosphere is now a tantalizing mouthful of flavors, dripping with fresh cheese and new tomatoes.

In its August 2001 issue, the respected periodical demanded that the Consumers Union, which publishes Consumer Reports, recall the magazine based on safety tests of the August 2001 issue.
“Our testers sustained small cuts on their fingers from page edges, and found that the magazine repeatedly and easily caught fire when exposed to a heat source, such as a match,” Consumer Reports said. “In addition, the magazine would likely have turned right over if not for the safety outriggers that engineers attached to the cover.”
People looking for unbiased product information in magazine format should avoid the August 2001 Consumer Reports until the safety problems have been corrected, the magazine added.
Further information on the warning can be found in the August 2001 issue of Consumer Reports.

Frankfurt, Germany (SatireWire.com) – In a surprising tactical shift, the frustrated European Central Bank announced yesterday it will no longer intervene to bolster the sagging euro, but will instead intervene in English Premier League football matches. Its first test came in Saturday’s battle between Manchester United and Coventry, in which the Central Bank substituted German monetary theorist Otmar Issing for injured Man U. midfielder Paul Scholes in the 48th minute. Moments later, the 64-year-old Issing took a solid cross from teammate David Beckham and neatly tucked a header inside the near post. Manchester United won 2-1. 
Central Bank President Wim Duisenberg immediately declared the win a policy victory, but Coventry manager Gordon Strachan was angry that he was forced to replace striker Moustapha Hadji with 61-year-old Finnish Central banker Sirkka HÃ¤mÃ¤lÃ¤inen in the 33rd minute.
“Not only is HÃ¤mÃ¤lÃ¤inen a woman, but she’s an economist,” Strachan complained. “Every time ManU pushed forward, she insisted they were going the other way.”

In the press conference to discuss the deal, NetZero CEO Mark Goldston said the combined company will continue to provide free Internet access while depending on advertising revenue, a path that allowed the firms to lose a combined $100 million last quarter, and has led the share prices of Netzero and Juno to soar to 95 cents and $1.47, respectively. 
“Individually, our companies were not strong enough to exist and probably would have faded away,” explained Goldston. “But by combining operations, we will have a subscriber base of 7 million, which should prove very attractive to advertisers until we fold.”

New York, N.Y. (SatireWire.com) – Lucent Technologies today announced it has ended its search for a new chief operating officer with the surprise hiring of Stockpicker_Dude_78, a frequent poster on various Lucent stock message boards. “We interviewed about 20 people, most from major corporations, but Stockpicker_Dude stood out,” said Lucent CEO Richard McGinn. “For instance, when we asked this one CFO about working for Lucent, she said she would be ‘honored to join such a progressive company,'” McGinn recalled. “But Stockpicker_Dude’s response – ‘This stock will be $100+ by end of month! Shorts cover your asses!’ – was much more spirited.” 
In a brief statement, Stockpicker_Dude said he heard Lucent was a major takeover target, and added he would be loading up on the stock in the morning.

Newark, N.J.

For example, Continental Airlines’ 10 a.m. Newark-to-San Francisco flight will now leave at “Snookums” and arrive at “Tooey.” The airlines also said they would deal with two other common complaints – lost baggage and cramped seating – by increasing leg room in their lost luggage departments.

Media: Typos in Microsoft Earnings Release!,admin,https://www.satirewire.com/media-typos-in-microsoft-earnings-release/,"







Redmond, Wash. (SatireWire.com) – Initially saddened and confused by this week’s strong earnings report from Microsoft, which gave it little to criticize, the media rebounded strongly today, noting the release had “numerous” typos and grammatical errors that, said one reporter, “clearly show this is a still a company under siege and unsure of its server and operating system markets.” 
“Look at the first sentence – ‘Microsoft Corp. today announced income before accounting change of $2.58 billion for the quarter ended Sept. 30,'” said New York Times editor Frank Sherman. “There should be an ‘an’ before income. That, to me, is indicative of a company that is on its heels, and we have to question its .NET strategy going forward.” 
Joyce Cranston, an editor at Barron’s, said a mixed metaphor found at the end of the third paragraph was evidence of operating system weakness. “They use the phrase ‘a rich set of building blocks’,” she noted. “Excuse me? Building blocks can be rich? I sense a company struggling with the threat from Linux.” 
Added Cranston: “Oh check out this phrase – ‘During the quarter, MSN, the Web’s largest network with more than 210 million unique users worldwide…’ Hello? How about a comma between ‘network’ and ‘with?’ It completely changes the meaning of the sentence, and reeks of anti-competitive behavior.”

San Francisco, Calif. (SatireWire.com) – After using the courts to keep Napster and MP3.com from freely distributing music over the Internet, the Recording Industry Association of America today asked a federal judge to stop people from humming or whistling copyrighted songs in public. The RIAA also asked for $300 million in damages from the estimated 22 million drunken men who think banging out the opening drum beat to “Wipeout” is a good way to impress women in bars.
“Anyone who publicly hums or whistles is disseminating copyright-protected music and thereby infringing on our artists’ rights,” said RIAA spokesman Janet Fogerty. “Also, we don’t like it when the wind blows. It sounds too much like the beginning to Elton John’s ‘Funeral for a Friend.'”
Free speech advocates were outraged over the RIAA’s action, but women generally applauded. “Most of the guys I know can’t drum Wipeout when they’re sober, let alone drunk,” said Helen Kurtz, a 22-year-old from Manhattan.

“I can only assume incompetence is causing the AP to insist the U.S. is fighting the al Qaida because there is no al Qaida,” countered Tom Glocer, chief executive of London-based Reuters. “Even the U.S. government spells it al Qaeda.

Days after the state issued its first-ever Stage 3 Power emergency, millions of cause-minded Californians decided not to wait for the situation to get worse, and began sending the “Stay Offline” email to friends, family, and co-workers.

“Once again, Californians are responding to a crisis as only Californians can,” said Gov. Gray Davis, who added his staff is working nights in order to send out the email to as many people as possible.

Philadelphia, Pa.

“When a company performs poorly or something goes wrong, it’s long been accepted business practice to blame prevailing market conditions, or a rise in costs, or supply delays, or even a ‘change in the competitive landscape’,” said Greg Kaderle, a professor at Penn’s Wharton School of Business. “But we contend it is also conceivable that some companies are simply run by complete idiots who have no fucking idea what they’re doing.”

Microsoft Wants Case Heard By OJ Jury,admin,https://www.satirewire.com/microsoft-wants-case-heard-by-oj-jury/,"
Washingon, D.C. (SatireWire.com) – In a clarifying brief, Microsoft today urged the Supreme Court not to hear its antitrust case, but to send it to the jury from the O.J. Simpson criminal trial, a move that, Microsoft argued, would ensure that the software giant receive a fair hearing and eventually be found not guilty. 
“This case has many factual and technical errors, and we believe the Supreme Court should leave the onerous task of reviewing the evidence to the O.J. jury, which would be in the best interests of finding us not guilty,” Microsoft said in its filing. The O.J. trial jurors “would be ideal,” the brief continued, noting that they proved to be “deliberate, thoughtful, and inclined to ignore obvious guilt.”
In response, federal prosecutors said they will file a brief tomorrow asking the Court to deny Microsoft’s request, and instead send the case to the jury from O.J.’s civil trial.

"Post Office Leading the Way In New ""Paper Technology""",admin,https://www.satirewire.com/post-office-leading-the-way-in-new-paper-technology/,"







Washington, D.C. (SatireWire.com) – The U.S. Postal Service’s plan to print customer emails and send them as more expensive first-class mail may be the “tip of the iceberg,” according to analysts who predict that many other digital documents could also be produced at much higher cost, and much more slowly, by utilizing new “paper technology.” 
The comments come after the Post Office said this week it will test an email-to-paper system allowing customers to send emails to a post office to be printed and delivered as first-class mail. The cost would be 41 cents – eight cents more than current 33-cent postage.
“Theoretically, documents that now take up only a fraction of space on a single computer could be converted into literally mountains of paper,” said UBS Warburg analyst Gloria Naderki, who added she was also monitoring the postal service’s experimental messenger-by-horse technology, which she estimated is “at least 100 years away.” On a related note, Monsanto today revealed it is working on technology that will convert MP3s — music delivered digitally, often for free, over the Web — into expensive CDs and, eventually, 8-track tapes.

Parker Bros. Replaces Monopoly Money With Cheaper Euro,admin,https://www.satirewire.com/parker-bros-replaces-monopoly-money-with-cheaper-euro/,"







Beverly, Mass. (SatireWire.com) – In an effort to cut production costs associated with its famous Monopoly board game, Parker Brothers announced today it will replace its colorful play dollars with the Euro, a form of cheap fake money widely used in Europe. 
According to Parker Bros. spokesperson Amanda Wright, the company was looking to make a change from the pink, blue, yellow, green, and white play dollars it has made for decades, but didn’t want the switch to escalate production costs. It also had to assure that the new money not be mistaken for actual currency. The Euro met both requirements. “On international monetary markets, we can get one Euro for, like, 3 cents, or about five cents cheaper than it costs to make a blue or pink play dollar,” said Wright. “As for making sure it doesn’t get confused for real money, I think it’s safe to say that so far that hasn’t been an issue.”

New York, N.Y. (SatireWire.com) – Small technology companies weren’t nimble enough on Wall Street yesterday, taking another pounding as investors once again favored the stocks of big, lumbering, stupid companies. “The market is sluggish right now, and small companies are very hard to get a hold of,” said Prudential analyst Henry Duncan. “Huge, slow, dumb companies are much more predictable. You can scarf down a whole bag of Cheetos and crush an empty can of Miller Genuine Draft on your forehead while watching your dog scratch itself before they’ll move much, one way or the other.”

Wausau, Wis.

“You know what, there are more Internet companies like mine than there are like fuckin’ Oracle, so why is it only the big players get to be bellwethers?” asked Garmon. “I’m going through the same shit, but I don’t see the Wall Street Journal writing, ‘If you want to know how the industry is hurting, look no further than Internet bellwethers Yahoo and BartGarmon.com.” 
Garmon acknowledged that things haven’t been going well at home lately, either.

"RIAA Demands End to Unauthorized Humming, Whistling",admin,https://www.satirewire.com/riaa-demands-end-to-unauthorized-humming-whistling/,"







San Francisco, Calif. (SatireWire.com) – After using the courts to keep Napster and MP3.com from freely distributing music over the Internet, the Recording Industry Association of America today asked a federal judge to stop people from humming or whistling copyrighted songs in public. The RIAA also asked for $300 million in damages from the estimated 22 million drunken men who think banging out the opening drum beat to “Wipeout” is a good way to impress women in bars.
“Anyone who publicly hums or whistles is disseminating copyright-protected music and thereby infringing on our artists’ rights,” said RIAA spokesman Janet Fogerty. “Also, we don’t like it when the wind blows. It sounds too much like the beginning to Elton John’s ‘Funeral for a Friend.'”
Free speech advocates were outraged over the RIAA’s action, but women generally applauded. “Most of the guys I know can’t drum Wipeout when they’re sober, let alone drunk,” said Helen Kurtz, a 22-year-old from Manhattan.
