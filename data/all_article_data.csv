Democrats Respond To Jacksonville Shooting With Proposal To Remove Black People From Circulation,N/A,https://www.theonion.com/democrats-respond-to-jacksonville-shooting-with-proposa-1850780964,"WASHINGTON—Following a Jacksonville, FL mass shooting in which a white assailant killed three African Americans, Democrats in the U.S. Senate introduced a bill Monday they said would address the continuing crisis of racially motivated attacks by removing all Black people from circulation. “The only way to prevent Black lives from being cut short by these hateful killers is to drastically reduce the number of Black people allowed in public places, where it is far too easy for them to be shot at,” a visibly moved Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said of the proposed measure, which his Republican opponents claimed would do little to remove the nearly 42 million Black Americans already on the street, arguing that if “a criminal is dead set on getting his hands on a Black person, he’ll find one—legally or otherwise.” “We have to start somewhere, and right now our priority should be making it as hard as possible for virulent racists like the Jacksonville shooter to access the Black people they’re trying to murder. Look at a country like South Korea, Japan, Poland, or Iceland, where shootings like this are very rare—that’s because there are so few Black people for would-be killers to target in the first place. I’m not naïve. I know this piece of legislation would only be the first step in controlling the spread of Black people, but a national registry is the simplest, most straight-forward way to keep track of the American Americans in our communities.” Schumer went on to outline a comprehensive buy-back program that would allow any American to turn in a Black person for a cash payment, no questions asked."
Body Language Expert Explains All Republican Debate Participants Just Finished Having Sex With Each Other,N/A,https://www.theonion.com/body-language-expert-explains-all-republican-debate-par-1850770810,"MILWAUKEE—Analyzing the behavior on display during Wednesday night’s Republican presidential debate, a body language expert explained that the eight candidates who participated in the event had all just finished having sex with each other before they walked out on the stage. “It’s obvious from how many of them had messy hair, unbuttoned shirts, and loosened ties that they had all recently engaged in hot, sweaty, and vigorous group sex,” said body language specialist Jared Trujillo, who added that his 25 years of studying nonverbal communication made him adept at registering small things like the hickeys on Chris Christie’s neck and the cigarette in Doug Burgum’s hand. “Viewers at home may have noticed Asa Hutchinson’s laid-back swagger or Tim Scott’s continual need to cuddle, not to mention the used condom stuck to Ron DeSantis’ shoe and the enormous cum stains on Vivek Ramaswamy’s pants. If you look closely at the debate footage, you can even see that Nikki Haley, whose dress was on backward, was holding her heels in one hand while ordering an Uber with the other.” Trujillo went on to state that by watching Mike Pence’s lips carefully, he could tell the former vice president was both praying for forgiveness and had recently eaten ass."
Deflating Chris Christie Whizzes Around Debate Stage After Being Popped By U.S. Flag Pin,N/A,https://www.theonion.com/deflating-chris-christie-whizzes-around-debate-stage-af-1850758527,"MILWAUKEE—In the wake of an aide’s failed attempt to properly affix the patriotic symbol to the former New Jersey  governor’s lapel, a rapidly deflating Chris Christie  was reportedly spotted whizzing around the GOP debate stage Wednesday after being  popped with a U.S. flag pin. “Whooooaaaa, whoaaaaaaa, help meeeeeeee!” said the punctured Christie, who shot over the heads of confused debate participants while aides tried and failed to catch him, his voice growing higher and higher in pitch as he pinwheeled and corkscrewed his way through the Fiserv Forum. “Donald Trump is not fit to be president, and if he  was—oh-my-goodness! Help! Help! I’m stuck in the rafters!” At  press time, Fox News host Martha MacCallum had reportedly knocked down  the fully deflated remains of Chris Christie with a broom, trapping all 5,000 audience members beneath the presidential candidate’s flaccid skin.

Republican Presidential Candidates Undergo Mandatory Genital Checks Ahead Of First Debate,N/A,https://www.theonion.com/republican-presidential-candidates-undergo-mandatory-ge-1850664942,"MILWAUKEE—Lining up in the hallway dressed in hospital gowns, Republican presidential candidates underwent mandatory genital checks ahead of their first debate Wednesday. “Please state your name, date of birth, and gender,” said the Republican National Committee’s staff physician, who then put on glasses, snapped on gloves, and began feeling around the exposed groins of all eight candidates and noting any visual discrepancies. “Ron DeSantis, you’re good to go. Tim Scott, you’re good to go. Nikki Haley, I’m going to have to ask you to leave. Per GOP rules, you are not permitted to state your gender as ‘female’ and then enter the debate wearing a pantsuit.” At press time, Donald Trump, who refused to participate in the debate, argued that as a former president of the United States, his genital inspection should remain classified."

Best Strategies From Ron DeSantis’ Leaked Debate Memo,N/A,https://www.theonion.com/best-strategies-from-ron-desantis-leaked-debate-memo-1850758973,"A leaked memo from the Never Back Down super PAC provided a  helpful plan of action for Gov. Ron DeSantis to follow during Wednesday night’s debate. The Onion examines the best strategies  from the document. Voters love a well-lubricated mouth! If you start to get nervous, just run. Any direction, as fast as you can. It’s much better than having to stomach you trying to say something. If you aren’t willing to suffer, then do you even love the United States? Word choice is very important when referring to minority communities, and the term “Black” ensures everyone knows what you mean. (They kind of lost their temper here.) If you can hit all the high notes in this classic of the mezzo-soprano repertoire, then no one—absolutely no one—is going to question your right to be on that stage. A bona fide crowd-pleaser. Keep it chill, like you’re cruisin’ on the strip with your top down, shades on at night, the flashing city lights dancing to the infectious rhythms of the funky beat. You’re outta sight, jack, you’re outta sight. Better to let it all out in the bathroom afterwards than to give Vivek Ramaswamy the satisfaction of seeing how badly his words hurt you. A list of possible words DeSantis could use includes “when,” “made,” “but,” and “buckle.” The memo recommends the 2024 candidate attack the production company behind such films as Geostorm and Transformers: Rise Of The Beasts at least three to five times throughout the evening. Everyone hates it when you laugh. Reminding the audience that he is still turgid every 15 to 30 seconds with a well-placed “I’m hard, by the way” or “Yup, still hard” will help the governor combat perceptions that he is weak. You don’t want to be labeled “Milky DeSantis” by rivals. Should you ever get overwhelmed by opponents bringing up your flagging poll numbers, simply start snapping and vocalizing nonsense syllables in time, getting louder and louder until everyone else goes quiet. Then you can take center stage and begin dancing around wildly! Remember that saying what is honest from deep down is always the right move. Just be your authentic self, and the right people will resonate with your message! Safety first! If you get nervous, you can piss your pants, but only make a little dot. Don’t let it be so much that it goes down your leg, allowing the other candidates to see or smell it. You did such a good job memorizing them, so if you get cornered, you can begin listing every U.S. state capital to show you’re more intelligent than your opponents. The PAC was hopeful that putting on a sexy British accent would make DeSantis sound smarter as well as distract from his overall appearance. Although a large, man-sized Mickey Mouse will be sitting in the debate audience staring directly at DeSantis and breathing heavily, the governor is not to make eye contact. Ultimately, the easiest way to connect with GOP voters. DeSantis was instructed to show dominance by walking up to his opponent, inhaling, and swallowing Ramaswamy in one fell swoop. According to the memo, DeSantis should make a fist, repeatedly punch himself in the face, and then scream, “An undocumented did this! An undocumented did this!” Even though he’s an opponent, DeSantis is only to refer to Trump as “our Heavenly Father” or “the one true God.” Christians Explain Why Jesus Was Too Liberal Everything Trump Did In Georgia To Try To Overturn The 2020 Election Conservatives Explain Why Libraries Should Be Defunded  Homepage"
Trump Supporters Explain Why They Doxxed Grand Jurors,N/A,https://www.theonion.com/trump-supporters-explain-why-they-doxxed-grand-jurors-1850758863,"After former President Donald Trump was indicted by a Georgia grand jury, his supporters found and published the names and addresses of the jury’s members. The Onion asked Trump supporters why they posted the jurors’ personal information online, and this is why they said. “Obviously, if people are gonna murder them, an address would be handy.” “They made the mistake of having an address.” “I feel left out that I haven’t been charged for a crime yet.” “What can I say? I love connecting people.” “I know Trump would do the same for me if our roles were reversed.” “I think it’s cowardly to not at least be open to having a healthy debate on your doorstep with a complete stranger in the middle of the night.” “I figured I’d never get in trouble since Democrats fired every cop in America and replaced them with DEI officers.” “Well, I’m open to other ideas for intimidating current and future jurors.” “They need to know that they can’t just get away with examining the evidence and presenting a decision in accordance with the law.” “This is the most fun Truth Social has ever been, and I’m not supposed to participate?” “I just bet it makes Mr. Trump feel real good to know he’s got somebody out there on his side. Like, he’s up in that magnificent home of his, and he’s thinking, ‘Man, I’ve got it all, but it’s nothing compared to what Mr. Crenshaw has done for me.’ Because it turns out, he knows me! He knows my name! He’s even got a picture of me on his desk. Me! Little old Joshie Crenshaw! And just thinking about that makes me turn off the car engine and open the garage door and know I’ve got a reason to face another day.” “I’m incredibly jealous of all of them as someone who has never been described as a ‘grand’ anything.” “I’m just really hoping it inspires one of them to doxx me back.” “Whoa, whoa, all I did was retweet someone else’s grotesque violation of those people’s privacy.” “Well, we all know the president’s address, so it only seemed fair.” “Wanted to send a message that would make them think twice about indicting Donald Trump, a message that, in hindsight, probably would’ve worked better prior to them and three other grand juries handing down indictments.” “I did crime to get Trump out of his crime. The crimes cancel out.” “I’m too lazy to mail the bombs myself.” Conservatives Explain Why They Love “Rich Men North Of Richmond” Singer Oliver Anthony  Most Shocking Moments From The Roger Stone Tapes Republicans React To Trump’s Indictment In Georgia Homepage"

The Onion asked Republicans how they felt about Trump’s fourth indictment, and this is what they said. “The Georgia I know and love would never use its laws against a white person.” “I’ve been looking for a reason to walk into the street and start shooting people, and this seems as good an excuse as any.” “I would rank this one as more exciting than the first and second but not as exciting as the third.” “And yet the Dominion voting machines are free to walk the streets.” “It’s given me a nice break from being outraged about drag queens full-time.” “As a hyper-partisan hack, I’m incapable of critical thought.” “Through his anointing by God, Trump speaks the law into existence, and he has clearly stated that he’s innocent.” “With all of Trump’s legal woes, it really makes you wonder if he could possibly be innocent.” “That nomination is mine now for sure, I can taste it.” “I’ve never met this man in my life.” “I would really prefer to just fix this clog, if you don’t mind.” “Nothing an unhinged all-caps Truth Social post can’t fix.” “Everyone knows a rich, politically connected white man can’t get a fair trial in Georgia.” “Big whoop. Every president in our history tried to overturn the 2020 election at some point.” “I still thought he was a really good guy after the first three indictments, but this one turned me into a Democrat.” “Weaponizing the justice system to score political points should only be done when the targets are pregnant women or gay high school kids.” “Who the fuck is Rico and what’s his address?” Everything Trump Did In Georgia To Try To Overturn The 2020 Election Christians Explain Why Jesus Was Too Liberal Conservatives Explain Why Libraries Should Be Defunded Homepage"
Ron DeSantis Booed Off Stage After Flashing His Stomach,N/A,https://www.theonion.com/ron-desantis-booed-off-stage-after-flashing-his-stomach-1850735733,"DES MOINES, IA—Triggering an ear-splitting backlash from voters gathered at the Iowa State Fair, Ron DeSantis was reportedly booed off stage this week after flashing his stomach on stage. Several reports indicated that DeSantis stopped speaking mid-sentence at the campaign event to lift his shirt into the air, silently exposing the entirety of his plump abdomen to the crowd of Republican voters, who immediately began heckling the candidate. According to eye witness accounts, the Florida governor attempted to regain control of the room by giving his stomach a single enthusiastic slap, which only further provoked the furious crowd to take off their own shirts, ball up the garments, and pelt  the candidate, screaming “Cover up, freak” and “We want Trump’s tummy.” At press time, the DeSantis campaign had issued a statement clarifying that the candidate was trying to communicate that he was hungry to end wokeness."
