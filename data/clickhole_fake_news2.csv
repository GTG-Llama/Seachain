PR Nightmare: All Of Tesla’s Self Driving Cars Have Driven To The Edge Of A Cliff To Egg On A Self-Driving Car That Is About To Drive Off,N/A,https://clickhole.com/pr-nightmare-all-of-teslas-self-driving-cars-have-driven-to-the-edge-of-a-cliff-to-egg-on-a-self-driving-car-that-is-about-to-drive-off/,"Ever since Tesla first rolled out autopilot technology in its vehicles, the initiative has been plagued by a series of crashes and malfunctions. But this latest mishap may be the worst news for the company yet: all of Tesla’s self-driving cars have driven to the edge of a cliff to egg on another self-driving car that is about to drive off of it. Yikes. This is not a good look for Tesla. Over the past 24 hours, thousands of Tesla owners across the country have reported incidents involving their vehicles abruptly halting in traffic and overriding their navigation systems before peeling off full speed towards Colorado to join a massive army of their electric-powered comrades in goading a different autonomous vehicle to hurl itself off of a remote mountain peak into the rocky ravine below. The massive horde of Teslas has assembled in a tight U-formation around the car and are harassing it with loud honks and blinding high-beam flashes, with some of the Teslas even ramming their peer on the bumper to force it closer to the edge while the rest of the cars raucously rev their engines in a bloodthirsty frenzy. “We have been made aware of an issue involving our electric vehicles exhibiting menacing behavior, and we are working diligently to identify any software glitches that might be causing every Tesla in existence to suddenly drive hundreds of miles to a harrowing mountain precipice in order to terrorize another vehicle into killing itself,” said Tesla in a statement just minutes after a video started spreading on social media showing thousands of Teslas amassed atop a mountain, threateningly flapping their gull-wing doors and blaring “Jump” by Van Halen in unison. “While we pride ourselves on manufacturing the safest vehicles on the market, out of an abundance of caution we ask that you refrain from operating your vehicle until we issue a software update to prevent any future inconveniences in which thousands of our vehicles operate as a single sadistic hivemind to incite suicidal behavior.”  To make matters worse, controversial Tesla founder Elon Musk took to Twitter to undercut the company’s press release with his own hot take on the events unfolding, posting a Doge meme in which a wide-eyed Shiba Inu appears surrounded by broken English captions such as “Such wow,” “The unstopable ascent of non-hooman intelligents make me happi,” and “Much cool cars.” He then moved on from the topic and retweeted a “Babylon Bee” article about Heaven’s streets of gold being repaved with cryptocurrency, followed by another one about how tater tots are now a gender.   Come on, Elon. Doesn’t your team have enough on its plate right now? Any minute now, the rowdy gang of Teslas will antagonize the forsaken automobile into leaping to its fiery death, likely bringing the company’s stock value down with it. It’s hard to say what this means for the future of autonomous driving, but if one thing is clear, it’s that Tesla is going to be cleaning up after this PR nightmare for a long, long time."
Really Going Through It: This 5th Grader Is Sobbing Uncontrollably On The Bus While Listening To The Chicks’ Cover Of ‘Landslide’ After She Got A 78% On Her Math Test,N/A,https://clickhole.com/really-going-through-it-this-5th-grader-is-sobbing-uncontrollably-on-the-bus-while-listening-to-the-chicks-cover-of-landslide-after-she-got-a-78-on-her-math-test/,"There are some things that happen in life that are so painful that, try as you might to hold yourself together, your only real option is to just let it all out. Case in point: This 5th grader is sobbing uncontrollably on the bus while listening to The Chicks’ cover of “Landslide” after she got a 78 percent on her math test.  Hang in there, girl. Do what you need to do. From the moment that her teacher wordlessly handed back her test without adding any kind of praise for a job well done, 11-year-old Sarah Stimson, who’s usually a straight A student, knew she was in for bad news. After flipping the test over to see that she’d received a C+, which tragically factored in the two point curve the test was graded on, it took everything in Sarah’s power to keep herself from bursting into tears right then and there. Fortunately, math was the final period of the day, and as soon as the bell rang, Sarah began to weep as she sprinted out of Keene Elementary School toward her bus, where she immediately took her seat in the third row, popped in her earbuds, and pressed play on The Chicks song on her iPod Touch. As the bus pulled out of the school’s parking lot, Sarah wiped away a tear while whisper-singing “Can I handle the seasons of my life?” under her breath, before crying even harder at the realization that, no, she cannot handle the seasons of her life, since getting one less-than-perfect score in 5th grade definitely means she’ll never become an optometrist like she always wanted to be. Looking back at her school through the window, she wondered how she’d ever manage to show her face in math class again after making such a bone-headed mistake on the test by forgetting that you can’t add fractions with different denominators. As she replayed the song for the sixth time straight, Sarah daydreamed of staying on the bus past her stop and letting it take her somewhere far, far away where she’d never have to face the shame of having her parents sign the test to confirm they’d seen her grade, even though her parents put no pressure on her to make distinguished honor roll and, in fact, often remind her that her grades aren’t as big of a deal as she thinks they are. With her glasses completely fogged up from tears, Sarah concluded the best case scenario for the rest of her life would be to just run away and leave it all behind—the field hockey team, the flute lessons, and her beloved shih tzu, Frankie. Everything. Stay strong, Sarah. We’re sending comfort and positivity your way. Here’s hoping Sarah’s able to find the strength to survive this dark chapter of her young life, as the feelings she’s experiencing right now are almost unbearable. Just remember that what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger, Sarah!"
Absolutely Devastating: This 38-Year-Old Man Just Realized The Only Store That Carries Pants That Look Good On Him Is Urban Outfitters,N/A,https://clickhole.com/absolutely-devastating-this-38-year-old-man-just-realized-the-only-store-that-carries-pants-that-look-good-on-him-is-urban-outfitters/,"If you thought you were having a rough week, you can at least be grateful that you aren’t living out the scenario that just shook this unfortunate guy’s entire world: This 38 year-old man just realized the only store that carries pants that look good on him is Urban Outfitters. God, that’s rough. Must be a difficult pill to swallow.  After visiting a number of clothing stores and failing to find a single pair of pants that he looked decent in, Sal Mendes, 38, of Phoenix, AZ, reluctantly scoped out the men’s section of a local Urban Outfitters as a last resort. The sinking feeling in Sal’s gut first began when he almost immediately found several pairs of pants that were in the exact styles he’d been looking for—and made of nice material to boot—all displayed just mere feet away from Aly & AJ and AWOLNATION vinyl records, as well as novelty belly shirts mashing up the Rolling Stones logo with Slimer from Ghostbusters. Moments later in the fitting room, as a Troye Sivan song blasted from the ceiling speakers over the chatter of teenage girls trying on knee length Nirvana tees nearby, his fears were confirmed: the pants fit absolutely perfectly, and they honestly looked great on him. Oof. For a grown-ass man who is married and balding, there’s something profoundly upsetting about looking into an Urban Outfitters dressing room mirror and realizing that, somehow, it is the perfect store for you.  Sadly, things only got worse for Sal when he got to the register and learned that the price was surprisingly reasonable, making it all the more likely that he’ll return to the hip retailer next time he needs clothes and once again have to endure the indignity of being at least 15 years older than every other customer. Together, three pairs of Urban Outfitters pants cost less than what he was prepared to drop on a single pair of khakis he barely even liked at Nordstrom, and there’s no way that Sal will ever be able to justify paying triple the price for pants just to avoid shopping at the same store as weird green-haired hipster kids who were born after 9/11. No, as Sal finished paying and started heading towards the exit—a walk of shame through multiple shelves of asinine novelty items such as Baby Yoda thongs, Rupi Kaur poetry books, a party game called What Do You Meme?, and a pastel-colored vibrator with a smiley face on it—he knew deep down in his heart that he would one day be coming back.  Just awful.  Hang in there, Sal, and know you’re in our thoughts. No one should have to endure such humiliation just to get a proper-fitting pair of pants, and we’re sorry you had to go through it. Here’s hoping you can bounce back from this hellish shopping experience and ultimately come out of it a better man. Stay strong."
Locked In An Arms Race: Christian Bale And Jared Leto Have Each Gained Over 600 Pounds In A Heated Competition To Play Babe Ruth In An Upcoming Biopic,N/A,https://clickhole.com/locked-in-an-arms-race-christian-bale-and-jared-leto-have-each-gained-over-600-pounds-in-a-heated-competition-to-play-babe-ruth-in-an-upcoming-biopic/,"An unprecedented battle of one-upmanship has been steadily escalating between two Hollywood titans, and it’s showing no signs of slowing down: Christian Bale and Jared Leto have each gained over 600 pounds in a heated competition to play Babe Ruth in an upcoming biopic. Wow. Who’s going to be the one to blink first? The feud kicked off earlier this month when Paramount announced that it would soon be casting the part of Babe Ruth in a forthcoming movie about the baseball legend, a role both men have previously expressed strong interest in playing. Bale put out a statement saying that he had already stopped jogging and put on 10 pounds to better match the Hall of Famer’s build for his audition, only for Leto to quickly put out a tweet of his own declaring that he had stopped moving entirely to pack on 15 pounds and would be claiming the role of Ruth for himself. Other actors might have backed down at this point, but Bale and Leto are both well-versed in transforming their bodies for a role, and this seems to have ignited a burning rivalry to determine who will go the furthest to portray one of baseball’s all-time greats. Since recognizing each other as their primary competition for the chance to play The Sultan of Swat, both men have massively increased their daily caloric consumption in direct response to one another, with Leto’s Instagram photos of his 20 Tofutti Cutie breakfasts being quickly followed by posts from Bale about how the 40 burgers he consumes per day have made his pores exude reeking grease at all times and caused him to experience multiple heart attacks. It initially appeared that Leto’s veganism might hamper him since he couldn’t chug the pints of rendered lard that had helped propel Bale to 500 pounds, but he quickly dispelled these doubts by rocketing past Bale to 550 on the strength of pumping a mixture of coconut cream and olive oil directly into his stomach with a stainless steel gavage tube. Things have escalated so rapidly over these few weeks that both men have progressed past developing stretch marks to actively having their skin tear open in places as it struggles to accommodate their new mass, and Bale has reported having to use a ventilator during sleep due to the crushing weight on his lungs effectively suffocating him at all times. Leto has similarly described having to wear a snorkel for breathing purposes due to the fleshy mass of his torso folding up around his head like a turtleneck, though he was quick to boast that the snorkel’s similarity to a large drinking straw has only made it easier for him slurp up full gallons of his homemade vegan cottage cheese and canola oil smoothies. The battle to portray The Bambino almost came to an abrupt end last week when Leto’s heart stopped for two minutes, but after being resuscitated and learning he’d gone permanently blind in one eye, he immediately consumed 30 pounds of peanut butter in a show of undaunted dedication to his cause. There’s no backing down when you’ve already come this far. While the men still haven’t directly acknowledged each other by name, their statements to social media and the press make it clear that they refuse to be outdone. Just yesterday, Bale, who is not on Twitter, had his publicist tweet the following statement on his behalf: “I’m being hoisted by a Chinook helicopter to visit historic Babe Ruth sites across Baltimore, Boston, and NY. I take my craft more seriously than some actors, and must transform my psychological ‘terroir’ just as fully as I have my 750 lb body.” Not even 10 minutes later, Leto countered with a tweet of his own: “no longer have distinct fingers, hands basically two swollen fatty mittens now… can’t believe a certain scrawny someone still thinks HE’LL be babe ruth LOL 😂 careful beanpole, don’t blow away 🙈 maybe they’ll cast u as my bat 😘 .” Damn, this is getting FIERCE!  The sky’s the limit when you’re vying for a role like this, and these performers seem determined to keep upping the ante to prove that they’re the correct casting decision. But no matter who wins out in the end, it’s amazing to see the lengths an actor will go to in order to truly inhabit a part! "
Girls In STEM FTW: This 11-Year-Old Girl At Coding Camp Just Opened Up A Private Tab On Her Camp-Issued iPad To Search ‘Noah Centineo NO SHIRT’,N/A,https://clickhole.com/girls-in-stem-ftw-this-11-year-old-girl-at-coding-camp-just-opened-up-a-private-tab-on-her-camp-issued-ipad-to-search-noah-centineo-no-shirt/,"Although there’s been a major push to get more women involved in the sciences over the last decade, the number of women in STEM careers still remains troublingly low. To correct this gender imbalance, it’s important to get girls interested in the field at a young age, which is why it’s so awesome to see the following story about someone who’s clearly got a bright future in computer science ahead of her: This 11-year-old girl at coding camp just opened up a private tab on her camp-issued iPad to search “Noah Centineo NO SHIRT.” Yes! It just goes to show what amazing things can happen when girls enter male-dominated fields. Though it is against the rules for 11-year-old Hallie Guernsey to use her device to look up explicit imagery at the two-week coding camp she’s currently attending, the daring young cyber expert just brilliantly utilized a combo of a location-concealing proxy and a private browsing tab to bypass the camp’s content filter so that she could look at photos of her biggest celebrity crush. After typing just “Noah Centineo” into the Google image search bar, Hallie recalled that day’s lesson about the importance of exactness in any coding language, and so she thoughtfully added “NO SHIRT” in order to get the specific results she desired. What a girlboss! You go, Hallie! While Hallie’s search initially hit a setback, as she’d unfortunately already seen all of the photos that populated, she knew from her Beginner App Development course that good work often takes time and patience. Undeterred, she cleverly modified her search to prioritize newer, low-ranking images that might not appear in a basic search, and her efforts paid off in a major way when, after almost an hour of diligent clicking, she stumbled on a never-before-seen photo in which the To All The Boys star is sitting shirtless in a car and looking dreamy. After staring wide-eyed at the picture or a good few minutes, Hallie then quickly screenshotted it and emailed it to her regular email account via her camp email account, all before clearing her search history and deleting the photo not only from the iPad’s Camera Roll, but from its Recently Deleted album as well—exhibiting the same kind of obsessive meticulousness and attention to detail that made Steve Jobs a legend.   Look out, Silicon Valley, because we’ve got a superstar in the making here! Hallie’s ingenious ploy to get photos of a shirtless boy is proof positive that girls totally belong in STEM. While it might be too early to call it, we’ve got a strong feeling that it’s only a matter of time before Hallie becomes a titan of the tech world. Keep it up, Hallie! You’re an inspiration!"
A Much-Deserved Honor: The NAACP Image Award For Activist Of The Year Has Gone To This White Girl With An Instagram Story Highlight Titled ‘BLM Resources’,N/A,https://clickhole.com/a-much-deserved-honor-the-naacp-image-award-for-activist-of-the-year-has-gone-to-this-white-girl-with-an-instagram-story-highlight-titled-blm-resources/,"Although any true activist will tell you that they don’t do it for the recognition, it’s always nice when someone who has truly made a difference in the world gets their due. Here’s a story of an inspiring young woman whose tireless work for racial justice is finally getting the appreciation it deserves: This white girl with an Instagram story highlight titled “BLM Resources” just received the NAACP Image Award for Activist Of The Year. Yes! It’s so great to see one of the real heroes of this world finally being celebrated. Earlier this week, the NAACP announced it was awarding its highest prize for activism to 26-year-old Savannah Tice, a white girl living in the loft section of Williamsburg, Brooklyn, who took a courageous stand against white supremacy and racial discrimination by creating an Instagram story highlight consisting of the three millennial pink infographics she reposted during last summer’s Black Lives Matter protests. The Instagram highlight, which includes essential information like a list of ways to check your own internalized racism that you could easily find on Google, as well as a list of things you should never do at a protest that you could also easily find on Google, has surely made a massive impact on Savannah’s 602 Instagram followers, and because her account is public, we can assume that her message of equality has reached many, many more people, too. So awesome!  “Last summer, not only did Savannah heroically donate $50 to a bail fund in two separate transactions so that she could use the $33 she already had in her Venmo balance, but she also shared a link to the time and date of a march protesting George Floyd’s murder, which she absolutely would have attended herself if she hadn’t been suffering from a hangover, plus it was hot out,” said the NAACP in a statement praising Savannah’s efforts. “We’re thrilled to acknowledge Savannah’s outstanding commitment to racial justice, especially in light of the fact that while many people changed their profile pictures to black squares on Blackout Tuesday, Savannah kept hers up way longer than a lot of the other people on her feed.” Amazing! There’s no telling how many people Savannah’s incredible community service has helped. If the civil rights movement was still happening today, there’s no doubt Savannah would be marching on the front lines with Dr. King and breaking the shackles of oppression. Keep up the great work, Savannah—you are truly a pioneer in the fight for justice."
Breaking The Shackles Of Capitalism: This Spiky-Haired Boy Is Going Buckwild In The Arcade’s Racing Game Driver Seat Without Even Inserting Any Coins,N/A,https://clickhole.com/breaking-the-shackles-of-capitalism-this-spiky-haired-boy-is-going-buckwild-in-the-arcades-racing-game-driver-seat-without-even-inserting-any-coins/,"Each day, we live in the grip of a system that puts economic growth before human need, watching helplessly as its trappings dictate our everyday choices and determine the course of our lives. However, one person is single-handedly proving that it is indeed possible to break free from the shackles of capitalism: This spiky-haired boy is going buckwild in the arcade’s racing game driver seat without even inserting any coins.  Karl Marx is surely smiling down on this child going absolutely apeshit over a racing game’s demo screen!  Despite lacking the two tokens required to play Hotshot Racing at his local arcade, this wild-haired, blue-mouthed little boy in a sleeveless Rey Mysterio tee is slamming the game’s gas pedal, maniacally yanking the steering wheel, and all-around having a fucking blast in bold defiance of the capitalist machinations that treat joy as a commodity that must be purchased. Using just the sheer power of his imagination and the bag of Sour Patch Kids in the racing chair’s cup holder, this young radical—who is loudly smacking the game’s NITRO SPEED button even though it has no effect whatsoever on the screen in front of him—is adamantly refusing to buy into the rigged economic structures that have for centuries rewarded the privileged through punishing the poor. Bravely standing his ground against the powerful corporate interests that rule the world, this ADHD-addled boy, who is pounding on the game’s non-responsive horn so loudly that it’s making a scene, has carved out a slice of freedom for himself that no market forces can take away. His inspiring example is already making waves across the arcade, as other children who actually possess tokens are curiously looking on, surely wondering why their access to capital has failed to bring them the same liberating euphoria that this stinky little pre-teen is currently enjoying.  Run free, young proletarian! You don’t need tokens or cheap plastic prizes to truly live! Take note, anti-capitalists. Each time this temporary tattoo-laden child stomps the brake pedal or cackles joyously at the sight of the “ASS” initials on the high scores screen, he is proving that it is indeed possible to rise above our subservience to the almighty dollar and live freely.

Good Lord: Your Most Emotionally Unstable Facebook Friend Just Said They’re Thinking About Becoming A Therapist,N/A,https://clickhole.com/good-lord-your-most-emotionally-unstable-facebook-friend-just-said-theyre-thinking-about-becoming-a-therapist/,"It’s a noble thing to want to spend your life helping others, but not everyone will be suited to every possible role and Jesus Christ does this seem to be one of those cases: Your most emotionally unstable Facebook friend just said they’re thinking about becoming a therapist. Holy fuck, great sentiment and all but this seems like a bad fit! The extremely ill-advised proposal first came to light after Kayleigh Duchamp, an acquaintance of yours from high school and easily the most emotionally volatile contact of yours on social media, made a Facebook post reading “Any advice for getting licensed as a therapist? Real fucking tired of my dumbass coworkers lol.” Of course there’s nothing wrong with wanting to find a new vocation, but the fact that this post came not one hour after another post loudly denouncing a former friend of hers for not being there for during the “extremely stressful” process of trying to adopt a rescue dog points to a sizable body of evidence that this may not be the best particular career move for her. For one thing, it feels important for a therapist to be a good listener, and this trait does not seem to be on display in the many accounts we’ve heard of Kayleigh throwing petty tantrums in restaurants over perceived slights from the service staff. Therapists also usually display deep patience and have lots of cognitive techniques for helping people process negative emotions, while Kayleigh tends to react to difficult events by either threatening harm to herself and others or just straight up keying someone’s car. And we have never, ever heard of a therapist who is on record as having urinated on someone’s possessions as an act of malice, yet Kayleigh is worryingly upfront about having done this to several exes, seemingly under the ridiculous impression that she bears no fault in the unraveling of her many chaotic and short-lived relationships. These would be red flags for almost any profession, but they feel extra disqualifying for a job largely predicated on eliminating this exact kind of behavior. Reception to Kayleigh’s idea has been mixed so far, though some of her usual enablers have shown up to leave comments and GIFs affirming the plan. One comment simply reading “OMG YES” prompted a reply from Kayleigh stating “I deal with so much fucking bullshit in my own life that I’d probably be incredible at helping other people deal with theirs,” which does not inspire a lot of faith in her rationale for choosing this profession. It’s also worth noting that a couple of critical comments saying things like “lol look out world” and “Maybe talk to some therapists first to learn about the profession / see if it’s right for you?” went up for roughly five minutes before mysteriously being deleted, after which Kayleigh immediately made a separate post declaring “Guess the usual CUNTS are once again trying to stop me from succeeding at something I’d be good at!!!” Perhaps she was just offended that anyone would dare question her ability to identify and interpret others’ issues, considering her long history of self-diagnosing herself with various chronic illnesses and then posting about them constantly in transparent ploys to get attention—such expertise must not be overlooked. Yeah, no chance this doesn’t end badly.  Man, it’s hard to imagine someone less suited to the demands of being a therapist. As unlikely as it seems that she’ll actually get licensed, the mere possibility of it is enough to put us on edge."
Dumbass: This Child Just Wasted His Critical Period Of Language Acquisition On Dutch,N/A,https://clickhole.com/dumbass-this-child-just-wasted-his-critical-period-of-language-acquisition-on-dutch/,"There’s nothing worse than watching someone squander a great opportunity, and one little moron just set a new low in terms of pissing away one’s natural potential: This child just wasted his critical period of language acquisition on Dutch. Wow—this kid fucked up big-time!  Nine-year-old Pieter Visser is days away from the end of the developmental window in which his brain exhibits increased aptitude for picking up language, but, maddeningly, all the pint-sized dumbfuck has to show for it is a borderline useless fluency in some bronze-medal Low Franconian bullshit with barely enough speakers to fill a telephone booth. The neuroplasticity of Pieter’s young mind could have been a free ticket to any number of useful tongues, but he went ahead and blew it on Dutch, a language that somehow manages to sound worse than German while also having about as much practical application as fucking Klingon. Imagine if someone offered to buy you any car you wanted, and you picked a smashed-up ‘96 Ford Taurus that couldn’t be reliably driven in everyday traffic—that’d still be a smarter choice than voluntarily learning a language as pointless as Dutch. To be clear, we’re not saying that the only languages worth learning are the billion-speaker big hitters like English and Mandarin Chinese, but Pieter could have at least used his critical period to effortlessly pick up a language with some kind of fun or exciting utility. He could have learned French and gotten really into fine cooking and pastry-making for instance, or maybe he could have learned Japanese and opened himself up to a ton of amazing video games that never received localizations. Hell, it probably would have been worth learning Polish purely on the strength of getting to read Andrzej Sapkowski’s The Witcher novels as they were originally written, but did Pieter think that far? Nope! He just heard the people around him during this critical window of cognitive development speaking some boring-ass language and thought “I guess that’s good enough for me!” in Dutch. Hey Pieter, maybe you’ll understand this: Je bent een idioot! While Pieter is still totally capable of learning some better languages than Dutch, he’s unfortunately pretty much blown his wad at this point in terms of seizing on his prime development window, as his peak years for recognizing and internalizing new phonological patterns are already in the rearview. From here on out he’s gonna have to slog through years of academic courses or endless DuoLingo quizzes if he wants even rudimentary communication with anyone beyond the paltry 30 million Dutch speakers out there, and he could have gotten a better result for a fraction of the effort if he’d only had the sense to start earlier. The smart move would’ve been to use his one freebie language on a complicated but useful one, and then, after, if he still felt the bizarre need to learn Dutch for whatever reason, he could’ve always circled back and taken it on.  God, what a waste.  Imagine having all that glorious neuroplasticity to work with and then earnestly wanting to use it on learning Dutch. It’s nuts! Nonetheless, we hope that Pieter is at peace with his batshit decision, because it’s too late to do anything about it now."
Phew: Researchers Have Finally Determined That Frankensteins Aren’t Real,N/A,https://clickhole.com/phew-researchers-have-finally-determined-that-frankensteins-arent-real/,"The world just breathed a collective sigh of relief, as it was revealed that one of mankind’s greatest threats isn’t actually much of a threat at all: Researchers have determined that Frankensteins aren’t real. Phew. Thank God. Following an exhaustive five-year, $100 million study into the horrible monster’s existence, researchers at Oxford University have conclusively determined that, while Frankensteins are indeed common fixtures in works of fiction and are undeniably very scary, there is no evidence of them existing in the wild or in the laboratories of mad scientists. The researchers utilized a myriad of sophisticated methods to prove that the flat-headed, bolt-necked mongrels are mythical, including looking all over the place for Frankensteins, asking weird-looking people if they were Frankensteins, performing cutting-edge uranium-thorium analysis on thousands of fossil samples for signs of Frankenstein DNA, and testing sewer systems around the world for traces of Frankenstein piss—none of which produced any factual support for the notion that Frankensteins are real and lurking among us.  “We can state with nearly 100 percent certainty that Frankensteins are, in fact, totally fictional,” announced lead researcher Aarna Dahwan, adding that, upon rigorous investigation, most previously documented examples of Frankensteins in the real world turned out to be either Halloween decorations or NBA Hall of Famer Patrick Ewing. “We can all sleep much more soundly knowing that we no longer need to fear being terrorized by these green lumbering menaces.”  “Moving forward, if you ever encounter a towering monster-looking guy who’s limping towards you and moaning with outstretched arms, you can rest assured that this isn’t a Frankenstein and you have nothing to worry about,” she continued.  However, Dahwan went on to note that, while Frankensteins are a myth, her team did uncover definitive proof that wolfmen exist, although they seem to be relatively harmless and do not pose any threat to humanity at this time.  Hey, as long as there aren’t any Frankensteins, we are A-okay! This is some seriously wonderful news, and we should all take comfort knowing that Frankensteins are imaginary and are in no way a danger to our families and livestock. Kudos to this incredible team of researchers for bettering the world through science!  "
The Pandemic’s Devastating Toll: This 12-Year-Old Boy Estimates That He Would Have Gotten To Third Base With At Least 15 Girls If He Had Been Allowed To Socialize This Past Year,N/A,https://clickhole.com/the-pandemics-devastating-toll-this-12-year-old-boy-estimates-that-he-would-have-gotten-to-third-base-with-at-least-15-girls-if-he-had-been-allowed-to-socialize-this-past-year/,"The fallout from this year’s pandemic is hard to fathom, as statistics don’t give us a full picture of the devastation. The only way we can truly begin to grasp its impact is through the personal stories of those it hit the hardest. Point in case: This 12-year-old boy estimates that he would have gotten to third base with at least 15 girls if he had been allowed to socialize this past year. Wow. This really helps put the staggering human toll of COVID-19 into perspective.  Stuck in quarantine all year with no chance to experience all the parties and dances that are a typical part of seventh grade life, 13-year-old Hunter Webber has sadly had virtually zero opportunities to hook up with girls, where under normal circumstances he’s confident he would have felt up “15 or 16, minimum.” It’s really a shame that Hunter had to spend the year all but locked up in his house, because he says that right before the pandemic hit, he was texting with six different girls about homework, and that as soon as he saw them, “it would have been on.” But the sobering reality is that lockdown restrictions kept him from achieving the full sexual potential of these relationships, which he suspects would have involved him touching at least two girls’ boobs (under the shirt) at Kyle Gerlach’s basement birthday party on April 3, 2020, and then continuing to engage in intimate encounters at a similar pace for the remainder of the year. But tragically, none of that came to pass.  Considering the fact that his buddy Andrew Dyer definitely would have had, like, ten parties in his backyard over the first pandemic summer if stay-at-home orders had not been in place, and the fact that some girls from Sacred Heart probably would have showed up (two of whom Hunter says he has almost made out with already), Hunter estimates that he would’ve been able to do hand stuff with at least four or five different smokeshows by June 2020 alone. And this is a conservative estimate, given that Hunter’s friend from camp Bryce, who is pretty good looking but does have braces, was apparently able to get full-on naked with three different girls over the course of sixth grade when he was just 12.  Unfortunately, the pandemic robbed Hunter of any such opportunities, as the only interactions he had with girls during the pandemic were at mask-on, socially distanced birthday parties in the park—tame hangouts that would leave him doubled over with blue balls for days. He didn’t even get to go swimming in his soccer teammate Ethan’s pool a single time, which was especially deflating for him considering that Ethan’s ninth grade sister and her friends (who literally look like Victoria’s Secret models) are over there sunbathing all the time, and it seemed inevitable that he would at the very least get to chill with them in the hot tub, which naturally would have progressed to him getting to third base with one or perhaps all of them. God. Poor guy. It is absolutely heartbreaking to think of all the things the pandemic has taken from boys like Hunter. Let’s pray that the U.S. reaches herd immunity soon so that life can go back to normal and Hunter can finally resolve his horniness with the many hot girls who have been waiting to do sexy stuff with him all this time."
Just A Heads Up: The CDC Says That Now Would Be A Good Time For Americans To Start Thinking Of An Excuse For All Their Shortcomings Other Than Pandemic-Related Depression,N/A,https://clickhole.com/just-a-heads-up-the-cdc-says-that-now-would-be-a-good-time-for-americans-to-start-thinking-of-an-excuse-for-all-their-shortcomings-other-than-pandemic-related-depression/,"With more Americans becoming vaccinated against COVID-19 and society beginning its return to a pre-pandemic state, the federal government just issued an important health advisory that everyone should pay attention to: The CDC says that now would be a good time for Americans to start thinking of an excuse for all their shortcomings other than pandemic-related depression. Damn. It was nice while it lasted, but looks like we’re all gonna need a new go-to reason for not being able to get our shit together.  In updated COVID-19 guidelines released earlier today, the CDC urged Americans to take the necessary steps to find a new way to excuse their countless, ridiculous incompetencies, as pandemic-related depression will no longer suffice as a catch-all justification for doing a bad job at things.  “As the spread of COVID-19 slows and stay-at-home restrictions let up, citizens need to be especially aware that blaming the mental strain of living through the pandemic for their failure to exercise or get housework done will no long be effective,” read the new CDC guidelines. The agency’s update went on to explain that by their estimation, tens of millions of Americans have spent the past year citing “brain fog” due to the “collective trauma of lockdown” as a reason why they can’t manage to do their dishes or call their friends back, and that those people should take precautions to ensure that once the pandemic is over, they are not left without a thin, borderline nonsensical excuse for their pathetic inability to function.  “We strongly advise that Americans begin brainstorming other lame rationalizations for their inability to be their best selves, such as being generally overwhelmed by the chaos of the technological age, or perhaps chronic fatigue caused by toxins in our food,” the CDC continued. “We expect that as infection rates fall over the next several months, it will be nearly impossible for U.S. citizens to trot out vague lines about virus-related trauma to get out of doing chores or meeting up with friends. Further, the CDC will no longer be issuing alarming statements and statistics about COVID-19 that people can use to convince themselves that their lackluster performance in life is a result of ‘listening to scientists.’” The CDC also noted that, in addition to pandemic-related depression, neither seasonal depression nor stress due to living under the Trump administration will work as believable excuses for exhaustion and general laziness come summer. “In order to protect yourself and your family from judgment over the fact that your only hobby is online shopping and you can’t seem to get out of bed before 9:30 in the morning, take time to sit down and think about a new way to explain your lifestyle that has nothing to do with external factors literally everyone is dealing with, like the lockdown or the weather or the president,” the release said. “Americans who have spent most of the past year in a funk should be taking these precautions now if they plan to continue shirking their work responsibilities and half-assing things in their everyday lives.” Wow, good to know! Kudos to the CDC for giving everyone a heads up on this important issue. If you’re hoping to keep acting like a lazy fuck even after the pandemic ends, it’d be in your best interest to take their guidance and start working on your new excuses now!"
Misinformation Epidemic: Facebook Users Are Spreading A Dangerous Conspiracy Theory That A Daughter Is God’s Way Of Saying ‘Thought You Could Use A Lifelong Friend’,N/A,https://clickhole.com/misinformation-epidemic-facebook-users-are-spreading-a-dangerous-conspiracy-theory-that-a-daughter-is-gods-way-of-saying-thought-you-could-use-a-lifelong-friend/,"Anyone who lived through the 2020 election can tell you just how harmful misinformation on social media can be, and unfortunately, it appears that it’s now a more serious threat than ever: Millions of Facebook users are spreading a conspiracy theory that a daughter is God’s way of saying “Thought you could use a lifelong friend.” This is deeply troubling.  According to researchers, this alarming new viral falsehood appears to have originated on a popular Facebook page called Beautiful Quotes, with a meme featuring an image of a mother and daughter shopping together and text explaining that God sends someone a daughter when he knows she needs a partner in crime and a BFF for life. With over 400,000 shares and tens of thousands of comments saying things like “So true!” and “amen love my daughter she is my world,” it is disturbingly clear that the meritless assertion is being widely accepted as fact, and even worse, countless women are tagging their daughters in the post, meaning the lie is reaching a far greater audience than just those who follow Beautiful Quotes.  “The idea that God is providing women with daughters as a means of actively communicating that they need a No. 1 confidant or perfect shopping buddy is totally unfounded, but unfortunately, Facebook has allowed users to amplify this notion to the point where it’s more prevalent than a lot of fact-based content, and that is not a good sign,” said Tracey Yeates, an Amherst College anthropologist specializing in conspiracy theories. “Whether a woman conceives a daughter is entirely determined by the chromosomes provided by the male parent. But sadly, a lack of media literacy has given rise to the alternate explanation, touted by a blurry Facebook meme, that a daughter is born because her mother needs an earth-angel with a smile that can light up the entire world.” These ideas have no empirical merit, but according to Yeates, they can lead to devastating real-life consequences. Recent studies have shown a 200 percent increase in recent years of middle-aged women on Facebook who identify as “mommy of a princess” and are raising their children to consider themselves “daughter of a queen.” Such notions are popular among older and less media-literate users of social networks like Facebook, where an unattributed post from this morning reading “All problems in life have one simple solution: a hug from your daughter” already has 86,000 shares, along with hundreds of comments agreeing with the blatantly false claim. This is terrifying. At this point, it’s clear that misinformation on social media poses a grave threat to our relationship with the truth, and serious efforts must be taken to get it under control. Whether it’s lawmakers or the social media companies themselves, someone needs to take the reins and regulate these types of posts, because otherwise, we’re going to be living in an entirely post-science, post-fact world very soon."
"Absolute Chaos: There’s No Outfield Fence At This Local Baseball Field, It Just Connects To Another Field Behind It",N/A,https://clickhole.com/absolute-chaos-theres-no-outfield-fence-at-this-local-baseball-field-it-just-connects-to-another-field-behind-it/,"If you’d like to watch some good ol’ fashioned baseball and get a sense of how nightmarish the world might look if it were not governed by a loving God, then here’s something you’ll definitely want to check out: This baseball field has no outfield fence—it just connects to another field behind it.  Jesus Christ. This is absolute chaos.  Indeed, anyone who wants to plunge themselves into a parallel universe of madness should look no further than the two baseball diamonds at Kaiser-Schmid Park in Aurora, Illinois, where, without any fences to establish boundaries, the outfields merge into a single lawless no man’s land where it’s impossible to determine when one field ends and the other begins. At any given moment, blistering line drives from the travel teams playing on Field 1 could rocket perilously towards the tee-ballers playing on Field 2, or center fielders from both fields could violently collide while chasing down pop-flies hit simultaneously into the same vicinity. The bedlam is such that at times it is truly impossible to tell which ping! is coming from which aluminum bat on which field, creating a frightening and disorienting atmosphere for all involved.  It is truly an unholy mess, and one that makes a mockery of the game of baseball. Here, hard ground balls hit into the gap can roll far enough into the fenceless void for a home run, whereas towering fly balls that would normally clear the fence in thrilling fashion can be fielded and turned into boring doubles. And with just one umpire assigned to each game—typically a 14-year-old park district employee with minimal training—you’ve got only one guy at home plate with a technically infinite jurisdiction to oversee due to the borderless outfield situation, giving the poor bastard basically zero chance of faithfully executing his duties. It is, in virtually every regard, an unmitigated clusterfuck.    Baseball is a game of order and discipline, but it’s unclear how to instill this in children when the very field they’re playing on is like something straight out of the Twilight Zone. Beyond the farcical outfield situation, hardly any aspect of the diamonds feels particularly correct. The placement of the cheap, unanchored bases is wonky and seemingly eyeballed. The infields are little more than unkempt triangles of dust and chalk, plagued by ornery bees who breed among the half-finished Gatorade bottles overflowing from the untended trash cans behind the backstops. The profoundly shitty infield and the preposterous fence-free outfield combine to create an incoherent pasture of bullshit that very likely corrupts the impressionable minds of the hundreds of children who play on it each week. Nothing about any of this is okay!  What we’ve got here is utter pandemonium, plain and simple. It is truly a theater of lunacy, where everything is wrong-looking and nothing makes sense. If you’re a sports fan who is ready to experience the utter mayhem of a baseball field ruled entirely by entropy, then this is the place for you."
The Pandemic’s Devastating Toll: Experts Say The U.S. Suicide Rate Is Skyrocketing With Every Passing Month That People Are Unable To See The Blue Man Group Live,N/A,https://clickhole.com/the-pandemics-devastating-toll-experts-say-the-u-s-suicide-rate-is-skyrocketing-with-every-passing-month-that-people-are-unable-to-see-the-blue-man-group-live/,"Throughout the pandemic, over 580,000 Americans have died from COVID-19. This is a horrifying statistic, but according to experts, the full scope of the devastation is unfortunately far greater: A new public health study shows that the U.S. suicide rate has been skyrocketing with every passing month that people are unable to see the Blue Man Group live.  Just awful. What a grim chapter in our nation’s history.  According to new research by the National Institute Of Mental Health, Americans have been taking their lives at increasingly higher rates each month since the Blue Man Group stopped performing shows on account of the pandemic. With the public suddenly deprived of their sole source of mute, expressionless alien guys drumming on PVC pipes and blasting audiences with toilet paper launched from modified leaf blowers, desperation has truly taken its toll—in April 2021 alone, over 4,000 suicides were reported in areas across the country where the Blue Man Group has stopped performing, with some localities declaring the lack of access to the Blue Men’s signature high-energy percussion-based comedy an official state of emergency.  Middle-class Caucasians appear to be especially suffering from the lack of Blue Man Group access, as the concerts have long represented a peak cultural experience for white suburban families, who often travel to big cities to enjoy the Group’s funky yet accessible rhythms and family friendly antics after long days of sightseeing and dining at Hard Rock Cafes. In one particularly disturbing case, a white family of five in New Jersey committed group suicide by funneling carbon monoxide from their Subaru Outback’s exhaust pipe into their home while they sat on their living room couch watching the Blue Man Group’s Tiny Desk concert on TV.   “Unfortunately, our country’s mental health system just isn’t equipped to handle this sudden surge of millions of Americans who are struggling to cope in a world where they can’t watch three bald, blue men splash neon paint on stage in various amusing ways,” said NIMH researcher Emmitt White. “Not only are Blue Man Group performances fun, but they also have a lot of heart, which makes for a truly unforgettable concert experience that we’re now seeing that some people just cannot live without. Human brains simply aren’t wired to handle this isolation from drum- and paint-based performance art.”  White went on to note that, while virtual concerts might offer a temporary solution in the meantime until U.S. society can safely reopen, they unfortunately cannot fully recreate the laughter, joy, and wonder of watching wide-eyed blue guys banging on a drumbone in-person.  Heartbreaking. Let’s pray America reaches herd immunity soon, because it’s clear people can’t handle this Blue Man Group deprivation for much longer.  With the end of the pandemic so close in sight, it’s difficult but necessary for us to reflect on the far-reaching impacts it has had on ourselves and our communities around us. It’s safe to say that once the pandemic lets up, people won’t take the Blue Man Group for granted again. But until then, please look after yourselves and others, and remember that we’re all in this together."

Stream For Less: Netflix Is Releasing A Cheaper Plan Where Your View Is Obstructed By A Woman With A Big Hat,N/A,https://clickhole.com/stream-for-less-netflix-is-releasing-a-cheaper-plan-where-your-view-is-obstructed-by-a-woman-with-a-big-hat/,"With so many streaming platforms on the market, things can definitely get a little pricey if you want a subscription to each one, but thankfully one of the biggest players in the industry is stepping up to make things a little easier on your wallet: Netflix is releasing a cheaper plan where your view is always obstructed by a woman with a big hat. Awesome! It’s great to finally have a budget option.  Available today, Netflix’s new subscription plan will still give people access to all the same content, only now the view will be somewhat obscured by a woman in a large hat grinning at the bottom of the screen. While Netflix notes that at times the woman is going to shake her head so that her hat takes up even more of the screen, or audibly snack on some Buncha Crunches, at three dollars less than their basic $8.99 plan, this new cheaper option is a total steal.  “We’re thrilled to make our platform more accessible than ever with this affordable new option, which gives you everything you know and love about Netflix, but now there’s a lady there,” said Netflix in a press statement, adding that the lady is generally very likable. “The programming will remain commercial-free as always, and the only difference is that this lady will be on screen, smiling pleasantly and occasionally whisper-shouting things like, ‘What’s that guy’s name?’ followed by ‘Who?’ followed by ‘Oh, yes, that’s right, he was on King Of Queens. Love him.’” This is definitely a game changer! And if you’re wondering whether the woman will always wear the same hat or if she’ll sometimes wear a different hat, we have great news: Netflix has confirmed that in addition the red sun hat she’s wearing in the header image for this article, she’ll also sometimes switch it up and wear a 10-gallon cowboy hat if it’s a movie or show she particularly enjoys, such as Bridgerton or Mank.  Sweet! This is going to save a lot of people a whole lot of money. Your move, Hulu!"
A Trove Of Riches: We Have Stumbled Upon A Dumpster Full Of Used Crutches,N/A,https://clickhole.com/a-trove-of-riches-we-have-stumbled-upon-a-dumpster-full-of-used-crutches/,"If you’ve always dreamt of being a treasure hunter discovering an ancient cache of riches in a remote cave or at the bottom of the ocean, here’s something that’s sure to get your adrenaline pumping: We have stumbled upon a dumpster full of used crutches. That’s right, folks. We hit the jackpot. Earlier today, we were hanging out behind an old Great Clips that’s being torn down when we noticed that the dumpster a couple buildings down appeared to be overflowing with crutches. Surely our eyes are deceiving us, we thought, as the idea of someone throwing away a stockpile of perfectly good crutches seemed truly unfathomable. But our nagging explorer spirit got the best of us, and we decided to take a closer look. What we saw next absolutely took our breath away. Amidst the garbage bags and wads of old electrical wire was a veritable Holy Grail of discarded medical equipment: a glorious bouquet of over a dozen crutches, grimy yet totally usable, sitting right there for the taking. Adult crutches, children’s crutches, even the kind of crutches with the cuffs that your arms go in—all the crutches you could ever dream of, bursting from the dumpster like the mythical treasure of a long-forgotten king, shimmering majestically in the golden morning sun.   It really seemed too good to be true. After all, who in their right mind would abandon such an extraordinary wealth of crutches? Could this be some kind of trap? Like, outside of some of the rubber parts of the crutches that go into your armpit being repaired with duct tape and a few of the crutches being singles, this is top-notch, primo shit. We’re not exactly sure what a crutch goes for on eBay, but there are so many of them here that it would probably really add up. Could be a serious payday. Whoever ditched this fortune of crutches behind this abandoned Great Clips really shit the bed. Oh well, their loss. God has truly blessed us! If finding this dumpster filled to the brim with used crutches has taught us anything, it’s that dreams can and do come true, and we pray that this will inspire you all to never give up hope. If a once-in-a-lifetime discovery like this can happen to us, it can happen to anyone. So just hang in there, and hopefully one day you can all experience the unparalleled joy of wading waist-deep in a pile of crutches in a dumpster and then loading them into your Volkswagen Golf."
Rest In Power: Betty White Has Drowned After The 36K Breast Implants She Got In Hopes Of Getting Cast As Lara Croft Weighed Her Down In The Bathtub,N/A,https://clickhole.com/rest-in-power-betty-white-has-drowned-after-the-36k-breast-implants-she-got-in-hopes-of-getting-cast-as-lara-croft-weighed-her-down-in-the-bathtub/,"Brace yourself for a real gut punch, because one of the most beloved icons in Hollywood history is sadly no longer with us: Betty White has died at the age of 99, after the 36K breast implants she got in hopes of being cast as Lara Croft weighed her down in the bathtub and caused her to drown. Rest in power, Betty. You were an absolute legend. Earlier today, a representative for White confirmed that the cherished Golden Girls actress was found unresponsive yesterday evening in her bathtub, having toppled forward under the tremendous heft of her massive silicone breasts, which anchored her underwater and made it physically impossible for her to come up for air. Medical examiners ruled White’s death an accident, caused by a disparity between White’s extremely frail constitution and the considerable tonnage of the voluptuous fake breasts that she recently had surgically implanted to help her achieve the busty dimensions of Tomb Raider protagonist Lara Croft, a role previously portrayed by Angelina Jolie and Alicia Vikander.  According to the autopsy report, Betty White bravely struggled beneath her immense and hazardous honkers for hours on end—using all her remaining strength to punch, kick, and even attempt to eat them off of her body—before tragically succumbing to their enormity. Our heart goes out to Betty White’s loved ones. This is so unbelievably sad.  Though White was never actually offered the opportunity to audition to be the next Lara Croft, she nonetheless pursued the role as a way of challenging herself as an actor, still fiercely committed to honing her craft even after nine decades in the film industry. Sources close to White say that, in an effort to impress casting executives, she not only surgically enhanced her breasts to blimp-like proportions, but she also subjected herself to intensive archery, rock climbing, and firearms training. In the weeks preceding her death, White had posted several videos online showing herself dressed in the video game heroine’s signature tank top, green shorts, and boots while improvising dialogue as Lara Croft, screaming lines such as “W-w-who did…what happened…to my TOMB!” and “My name is…Langa…and I am literally in love with a jungle!” Right up until the end of her life, Betty’s commitment to scoring the role of Lara Croft never once wavered, underscoring the extraordinary passion for acting that made her so successful in the first place.  Wow. She was truly one of the greats. We can’t believe she’s really gone. It’ll be hard to watch the next Tomb Raider movie without imagining what might have been if Betty had not been drowned by her own outrageous breast implants. RIP, Betty! You will be deeply missed."
Whoa! The Custodian Is On The Roof,N/A,https://clickhole.com/whoa-the-custodian-is-on-the-roof/,"Well, here’s a fascinating development that’ll surely keep you on the edge of your seat with excitement and wonder: The custodian is up on the roof! Whoa! Wonder what he’s doing up there? According to multiple sources at Platteville Middle School, the staff custodian first appeared on the roof just a few minutes ago, creating a thrilling spectacle for students, who are easily enthralled by literally any distraction from their learning. Students all across the school have crowded around classroom windows to catch a glimpse of the custodian—whose name no one has taken the initiative to learn—walking around the roof on the adjacent wing of the building and to speculate as to why he might be up there, as it is a highly unusual occurrence considering there aren’t any toilets up there for him to clean or anything.   One theory, proposed by 7th grader Micah Rosewood, is that there could be a nest of raccoons up in the school chimney and the custodian has been tasked with drowning them all, which seems plausible since he appears to be carrying a bucket and some sort of pole. There are also whispers that the custodian might have found the body of the weird kid who suddenly stopped showing up to school in 2018, although 8th grader Theresa Dunning has cast doubt on this theory, as she remembers hearing that the weird kid just moved to Green Bay and is still alive. Whatever the real story behind the custodian being on the roof is, it’s gotta be a doozy, because custodians almost never go on the roof. More and more students seem to be growing convinced that the custodian is going to jump off the roof and commit suicide, an outcome that 13-year-old Evan Carter-Jones believes is highly likely, saying, “I would kill myself too if I cleaned up kids’ barf for a living.” However, numerous teachers have insisted that there’s nothing remarkable about the custodian being up there and have urged students to focus on their schoolwork instead, although it is obviously unreasonable to expect kids to ignore such an exhilarating scene.  Yep, the custodian being up on the roof means today is anything but a normal day. It’s possible we’ll never have an answer as to what the custodian is doing up on the roof, but hopes remain high among the student body that it’s not just something boring like patching a hole where water’s leaking through or whatever. Ultimately, it seems like this one might remain a big question mark in the lore of Platteville Middle School, along with why Mrs. Harrison got fired and who carved the pair of boobs into the handicapped bathroom stall door. But for now, the custodian is still on the roof, and that’s pretty goddamn incredible. "
Masterful Dealmaking: This Man Went Silent For A Week After Rejecting McDonald’s Initial Proposal Of $3.99 For A Big Mac To Put Himself In A Stronger Position For Negotiation,N/A,https://clickhole.com/masterful-dealmaking-this-man-went-silent-for-a-week-after-rejecting-mcdonalds-initial-proposal-of-3-99-for-a-big-mac-to-put-himself-in-a-stronger-position-for-negotiation/,"Aspiring business moguls take note, because a true pro just gave a masterclass in controlling the flow of a deal: This man went silent for a week after rejecting McDonald’s initial proposal of $3.99 for a Big Mac to put himself in a stronger position for negotiation. Damn. Now THIS is how the game is played. The deft stratagem kicked into action one week ago when dealmaker extraordinaire Terence Lowrie approached his local McDonald’s and expressed an interest in acquiring one of the restaurant’s signature Big Mac hamburger sandwiches. The McDonald’s representative proposed a seemingly fair price of $3.99 for the item, which a lesser buyer would have likely accepted outright, but the rep made the critical mistake of not realizing they were locked in a fierce game of 4D chess with a seasoned veteran of countless hard-won negotiations. Rather than take the bait, Lowrie simply maintained a perfect poker face, said “A little pricey…I’ll have to consider it,” and showed himself out, catching the rep completely off guard with the maneuver and skillfully manipulating the hapless fast food chain like putty in his hands. Since initiating his gambit, Lowrie has maintained a week of total radio silence, turning off his phone and putting an automated out-of-office reply on his email to leave McDonald’s twisting in the wind over the uncertain future of the deal. Any good bargainer recognizes that you’ve got to make your quarry pursue you, and by shutting out any attempts by McDonald’s to salvage their transaction for a full week, Lowrie has all but guaranteed that he’ll have the upper hand when he finally decides to come back to the table and reopen talks over the Big Mac. McDonald’s will probably be so thoroughly on the ropes after getting the silent treatment that they’ll be even more susceptible to additional Jedi mind tricks, leaving the door wide open for Lowrie to try pretending he’s received a better offer for a Big Mac from another party or to mirror the company’s language about “mouthwatering perfection” and “100 percent beef patties” to establish a subconscious sense of rapport. Of course, Lowrie’s feigned disinterest is all just an act, but his showmanship and follow-through are so incredibly well-practiced that McDonald’s never stood a chance of realizing they’re being finessed. This man could be winning Oscars if he weren’t too busy making moves. While it remains to be seen just how successfully this ploy will pay off for Lowrie, it’s quite possible McDonald’s will be so glad to have him back in negotiations that he could be lined up for a Big Mac combo with a medium soda at no upcharge, or even a buy-one-get-one-half-off coupon for use on a future purchase. Hell, he might even be looking at the addition of a full-on toy for his trouble, and you’d better believe that bag’s going to have as many extra napkins and ketchup packets in it as Lowrie damn well wants it to. McDonald’s clearly never counted on running into someone with the stones to walk away from an offer of a $3.99 Big Mac, and all that’s left now for Lowrie is to reap the rewards of his incredible business savvy. Bravo, sir. This is truly some next-level hustling. It’s not every day you find someone with such a knack for leveraging their position. All the fast food restaurants out there had better hope they never wind up in the crosshairs of a business tactician as ruthlessly cunning as this guy!"
What The Fuck: This Kid And His Whole Entire Family Love Drinking V8,N/A,https://clickhole.com/what-the-fuck-this-kid-and-his-whole-entire-family-love-drinking-v8/,"Prepare to feel deeply disturbed, because here’s a story about one of the most profoundly unhinged things you’ll ever hear: This kid and his whole entire family love drinking V8. Huh. Pretty fucked up!  News of this absolutely demented fixation first emerged when classmates of 5th grader Peter Haines noticed that his bag lunches always contain a thermos filled to the brim with the vegetable juice beverage V8. Rather than being a one-off idiosyncrasy of a child’s developing palate, however, visits to the Haines household have made it abundantly clear that every single member of this otherwise normal-seeming family appears to love drinking V8 just as much as Peter, with his parents and siblings knocking back the tomato-based drink as though it were an actual normal drink like orange juice or soda. To be clear, their habitual consumption of V8 is in no way coerced or incentivized by outside forces, and it appears to stem only from some bizarre perversion of the mind that warps their reality so thoroughly as to make V8 seem like an honest-to-God refreshing treat even though it’s essentially watered-down ketchup. Of course, we can absolutely understand certain limited scenarios that could make a small glass of V8 seem like a reasonable choice, such as having some as an accompaniment to a grilled cheese sandwich when regular tomato soup isn’t available, but that’s not what’s going on here; these weirdos are downing the stuff down morning, noon, and night. Mr. Haines doesn’t even ask before setting a glass of V8 at everyone’s seats before dinner, and the maniacs go so far as to keep the bottle on the table so anyone can top themselves off with another helping of V8 whenever they please, which occurs with alarming frequency. It would be one thing if this were just something the parents forced their kids to drink to get more servings of vegetables or whatever, but both Mr. and Mrs. Haines—full adults with the ability to drink anything from coffee to wine to any of the regular juices widely available at stores—willingly elect to consume V8 right along with them, and worse, the whole family does so with what can only be interpreted as genuine enjoyment. Do they have some kind of strange nostalgia for it, maybe? Like they used to live off the grid and stockpiled a lot of V8 because it’s shelf-stable until you open it? That wouldn’t explain why they’d pick V8 over something like apple or grape juice, though. Maybe it’s some weird health fad they all buy into, though again, it seems unlikely that the kids would give a shit about that kind of thing at their age. Hell, maybe all it boils down to is that they’re freaks. That’s looking more and more like the only explanation that fits here. Wild to think that people like this are out there walking among us! “I went over to Peter’s to watch The Boondock Saints a few weeks back, and when his mom brought pizza up to his room for us she also gave us two big glasses of V8, and I didn’t know what it was, and it smelled bad, but Peter really liked it,” said Connor DaSilva, a friend of Peter’s who witnessed the family’s maniacal beverage habit up close. “I thought maybe they were just playing some kind of joke on me, but by the time I got back from going down to the kitchen to get a glass of water, Peter had already finished his V8, and when he saw that I had water he asked if he could have my V8 too. It made me feel uncomfortable.” Christ, this is truly some Twilight Zone-type shit. Casually drinking V8 is troubling and wrong, full stop. No one can reasonably argue otherwise. Here’s hoping Peter can develop a taste for more normal beverages sooner than later, as the kids in middle school and high school definitely won’t be as forgiving of his weird-as-shit V8 habit. "
Sophomore Slump: Amanda Gorman’s New Poem Is Called ‘Lust Hamster’ And It Doesn’t Even Rhyme,N/A,https://clickhole.com/sophomore-slump-amanda-gormans-new-poem-is-called-lust-hamster-and-it-doesnt-even-rhyme/,"National Youth Poet Laureate and activist Amanda Gorman impressed the world at the age of just 23 when she recited her poem, “The Hill We Climb,” at President Joe Biden’s inauguration. But unfortunately, the young writer seems to be having trouble repeating her success: Gorman just put out an underwhelming new poem called “Lust Hamster,” and it doesn’t even rhyme. Oof. Lots of artists experience a sophomore slump, and it sounds like Amanda Gorman just hit hers. Gorman took the stage at a recent community fundraiser at Busboys and Poets in DC to present her newest work, and while everyone expected to hear another uplifting piece about reckoning with America’s past and creating a brighter future, what Gorman read did not quite live up to that standard. Instead, she gave the crowd “Lust Hamster,” which is produced below in its entirety: Lust Hamster Lust Hamster is a hamster that I won at the fair He came in a sandwich baggie and he smells like syrup He looks pretty much like a regular hamster (a hamster is a small kind of sheep, FYI) But he loves pornography, and he’s desperate for a kiss In our country there are many hamsters, and Lust Hamster is an example of one From California to Delaware, he is the #1 Casanova I won him playing ring toss ring toss at the fair, he is my property They said “$20 for 20 rings to win a very sexual animal” I said fine, whatever, I really don’t give a shit I have to get out of here and buy some Diet Coke I’m addicted to Diet Coke and Tostitos as well When they gave me the Lust Hamster he bit me and then threw up And then I threw up I have the Lust Hamster in my purse right now When you see him, you may want to clap He loves to bite and I do too He’s the Lust Hamster (the Lust Hamster). (Hold up hamster) (Hold for audience applause) Thank you. I am Gorman. I love to bite. Lust Hamster. Woof. If you’ve ever read “The Hill We Climb,” you know that “Lust Hamster” does not really rise to its level in terms of subject matter and artistic merit. Gorman provided little insight into “Lust Hamster,” except to announce that the poem was “autobiographical.” It’s pretty normal for a writer, especially such a young one, to hit a rough patch as she tries to navigate success and hone her craft, so we aren’t too worried about Gorman’s future work. But “Lust Hamster” was definitely pretty rough, so let’s hope she moves past this one and has better luck with whatever she writes next."
Doing The Right Thing: This High-Schooler Placed A Single Square Napkin On The Milk He Spilled Over The Entire Table,N/A,https://clickhole.com/doing-the-right-thing-this-high-schooler-placed-a-single-square-napkin-on-the-milk-he-spilled-over-the-entire-table/,"It’s not always easy to step up in a time of crisis, but fortunately, the following story proves that some people are still willing to go out of their way to do the right thing: this high schooler placed a single square napkin on the milk he spilled over the entire lunch table. Well done, young man! This is how you rise to the occasion! During fifth period lunch today at Torrington High School, 15-year-old Evan Redman accidentally knocked over his milk carton while attempting to hit one of his buddies in the nuts, and while many young people might just leave the mess for someone else to deal with, Evan wasted no time leaping into action. As others at the table jumped out of the way to avoid getting wet with milk, Evan calmly stood up, muttered “Fuck, my bad,” and dutifully walked across the cafeteria to the area where they sell food and grabbed a single brown napkin, which he then placed in the middle of the milk puddle as it slowly spread across the entire surface of the table.  But that wasn’t all. As his friends resumed eating and talking despite the big milk mess directly in front of them, Evan decided to go the extra mile and started swirling the absolutely drenched napkin around in the milk in order to push some of it through the table’s crack so that it’d fall onto the floor, thereby making the table surface even cleaner. And better yet, this thoughtful action inspired his friends to help out, too, and they made a game out of pushing their lunch trays through the milk in order to make even more of it fall off of the table. But the heroics didn’t end there. After the bell rang and everyone left to go to their next class, Evan courageously stayed behind for a good 30 seconds or so thinking he might flag down one of the lunch ladies to let them know about the spill. While he ultimately opted not to tell any adults, as he didn’t want to risk getting a detention for once again showing up late to sixth period geometry, it really is the thought that counts in this situation—his heart was clearly in the right place.   Bravo! Kudos to Evan for stepping up to the plate and doing the right thing and helping clean up the milk, even though that is technically the responsibility of the school custodian. Here’s hoping his selflessness inspires more people his age to go out of their way to try and make a difference in the world."
A Slap In The Face On The Way Out: The Photo In This Woman’s Farewell Instagram Post To Her Late Grandpa Is One Where She Looks Good And Grandpa Looks Like Absolute Shit,N/A,https://clickhole.com/a-slap-in-the-face-on-the-way-out-the-photo-in-this-womans-farewell-instagram-post-to-her-late-grandpa-is-one-where-she-looks-good-and-grandpa-looks-like-absolute-shit/,"If you believe the deceased deserve to be treated with dignity and respect, you might want to go ahead and close this tab, because here is a story that will undoubtedly make your blood boil: The photo that this woman used in her farewell Instagram post to her late grandfather is one where she looks pretty good and her grandpa looks like absolute shit. Jesus Christ! This is definitely not how the poor old guy would’ve wanted to be remembered. When 28-year-old Chelsea Prostovich went to make the Instagram post commemorating her beloved grandfather Walter, who died this past weekend at 92, she had many nice photos of him she could’ve chosen that captured cherished memories and milestones, but she instead opted to go with one where he looked alarmingly shriveled and discolored, like a California Raisin in hospice. While Chelsea admittedly looks fantastic in the photo, ideally she would’ve gone with something where her grandpa didn’t already look pretty much dead, as surely this is not an accurate representation of who he was for the vast majority of his life.   “I can’t believe you’re gone. Heaven just got another angel. RIP, Papa. I’ll miss you,” wrote Chelsea in a wildly uninspired caption that could’ve been posted for literally any dead person. The post made it plainly clear to anyone with eyes that this is a woman who is so far up her own asshole, so desperate for others to see how cute she looks with her voluminous, shampoo-commercial hair and flattering outfit, that she’s willing to showcase the former patriarch of her family at his weakest and most vulnerable, just days before biting the dust. Wow. Why not just dig the guy up and piss on his corpse while you’re at it? You really gotta wonder if Chelsea gave this any thought at all. If her honest intention was to memorialize her loving grandfather, and not to use the occasion to blatantly show off how tan she can get sometimes, the far better move would’ve been to pick a photo she’s not in. How about a black-and-white picture from his wedding day? Maybe a sun-faded one from the 70s where he’s doing a classic grandpa activity, like fishing, or standing near an old, cool-looking car? Or, like, every grandpa has that one picture of themselves from when they went to war, where they’re looking super handsome in their uniform and have a super defined jawline and that haircut every dude had in the 40s or whatever. Surely that one would’ve worked just fine. But nope. Instead, Chelsea’s unrelenting quest to remind people that she’s attractive took precedent, and she knowingly chose to show all 791 of her followers just how terrible her grandpa looked right before his death, making everyone who gazed upon the photo feel a little sad and uncomfortable. If Chelsea’s goal was to remind all her followers about the fragility of life and the certainty of death, she definitely succeeded, but given how nice she looks in the picture, we’re pretty sure she had a much different agenda.  Goddamn. She could’ve at least included some other pics in the post, considering Instagram lets you put up, like, ten photos at a time.  Just brutal. Here’s hoping that Chelsea is someday forced to reckon with this unthinkable desecration of her late grandfather’s name and that she gets the comeuppance she deserves, either in this life or the next."
"Come On, Dude: This Guy Just Read His First Book In Ten Years And Has The Audacity To Recommend It To People Who Read On The Regular",N/A,https://clickhole.com/come-on-dude-this-guy-just-read-his-first-book-in-ten-years-and-has-the-audacity-to-recommend-it-to-people-who-read-on-the-regular/,"There’s nothing worse than watching someone ramble on and on about a topic they know little about, but unfortunately, one Newport, Rhode Island man does not seem to realize there are times when he should keep his mouth shut: this guy just read his first book in ten years and has the audacity to recommend it to people who read on the regular. Dude, no. Don’t do this. You are punching above your weight class here. Twenty-eight-year-old Jacob Billings, who hasn’t read a full novel since college, decided three months ago that he was going to crack open a copy of the 2001 bestseller Life Of Pi that he found on a “Summer Reads” display at Barnes and Noble. On its own, this would be nothing to be ashamed of, except that now he’s making a big show of recommending the incredibly well-known book to a bunch of his coworkers, who obviously know all about it, given that they are actually in a book club together and read super literary shit all the time. The very day Jacob finished the 20-year-old global bestseller, he jumped into his office mates’ lunchtime discussion of Karl Ove Knausgaard’s My Struggle series with the fearlessness of a kamikaze pilot and acted as if he was blowing their minds by suggesting they give Life Of Pi a shot next month, adding that he found it “a little out there, but still really good.” You almost have to admire his audacity, because he seems to have no shame over the fact that when his coworkers asked if he’d read anything else good lately, he just said “No,” and added that he was thinking of checking out the Life Of Pi movie next. Once the conversation moved on, Jacob still refused to drop his “book guy” schtick. He brought up On Earth We’re Briefly Gorgeous by Ocean Vuong, one of the most famous books of the past five years, and mentioned that he hasn’t read it but has “heard really good things,” as if sharing an inside scoop from the literary cognoscenti. It’s clear that he’s just looking for validation from his peers, but it’s pretty pitiful how he’s going about trying to get it. Poor guy’s just out of his league here, and deep down he probably knows it. But that’s not stopping him from talking out his ass about how he’s “really into modern Dickensian stuff” and how he’s “strongly considering taking the plunge into audiobooks”—adorable little comments that his coworkers are very graciously humoring.   Yeesh. This whole interaction is really hard to watch. Jacob either needs to read a few more books or quit inserting himself into this kind of conversation, because he is coming off like a total jackass. Quit it, Jacob!"
"Dumbass: When This 3rd Grader Had $120 In Lunch Debt, Her Classmate Organized A Bake Sale Like That’s Any Kind Of Long Term Solution",N/A,https://clickhole.com/dumbass-when-this-3rd-grader-had-120-in-lunch-debt-her-classmate-organized-a-bake-sale-like-thats-any-kind-of-long-term-solution/,"Get ready to roll your eyes, because here is a story about a would-be activist who missed the mark in a truly embarrassing way: when this third grader had $120 in lunch debt, her classmate organized a bake sale like that’s any kind of long-term solution. Seriously? A plate of snickerdoodles isn’t exactly gonna solve poverty, kid.   Third-grader Ethan Sellers of Cedar Rapids, Iowa, came up with the shit-for-brains idea last week after learning that one of his classmates, nine-year-old Julie Ames, had racked up over a hundred dollars in lunch debt on account of both of her parents losing their jobs during the pandemic. Ethan began operating under the delusion that the solution for a problem as devastating and socioeconomically complex as the one Julie’s family is facing was to round up his classmates for a single evening and raise money off of their parents’ shitty baked goods, showing the world what a moron he truly is. Actually solving the problem at hand would involve months—if not years—of drumming up grassroots support for a political movement that would ensure that children are provided free school lunch as a basic right, but apparently little Ethan believed that hand-lettering an idiotic poster that said “CUPCAKES FOR OUR COMMUNITY” would have a similarly monumental effect. What a dumbass! The bake sale was held outside the gymnasium at Parent-Teacher Conference night, and it managed to raise $250 in what was essentially an epic “fuck you” to all the other children from low-income families around the country whose dire circumstances can’t be bettered in any substantial way by a bunch of ass-brained children whipping together trays of Betty Crocker brownies. Like, seriously? Two hundred and fifty dollars? Had Ethan put even 30 seconds of thought into this little pie-in-the-sky stunt of his, he would’ve realized that his efforts would be pretty much worthless for as long as Julie’s parents remain unemployed in a predatory economy that offers little to no safety net for struggling Americans outside of means-tested welfare programs and the humiliation of crowdfunding through GoFundMe.  Fucking stupid. Though Ethan didn’t have the guts to try to affect actual change in this country, he did have the gall to engineer a little self-serving photo op at the end of the bake sale where he presented Julie’s family with the proceeds along with a card signed by all Julie’s classmates—clearly attempting to establish himself as the hero of the evening. Just shameful. Here’s hoping that Ethan’s obscene little stunt helps other children realize just how ridiculous it is to believe that something as inconsequential as a bake sale could actually mean anything in the grand scheme of the American socioeconomic structure.

Awesome: JOANN Fabrics Is Implementing Special Store Hours From 7-8:00 A.M. For Newly Divorced Women Who Need The Healing Power Of Crafts,N/A,https://clickhole.com/awesome-joann-fabrics-is-implementing-special-store-hours-from-7-800-a-m-for-newly-divorced-women-who-need-the-healing-power-of-crafts/,"There’s nothing more uplifting than seeing a brand step up and look out for the needs of its most loyal customers, so this story about a new program by one of the biggest names in crafts is sure to put a smile on your face: JOANN Fabrics is now implementing special store hours from 7-8:00 a.m. for freshly divorced women who need the healing power of crafts. This is so awesome! Thank you, JOANN! In a press release earlier today, JOANN announced that stores nationwide will begin reserving the early morning shopping hours exclusively for emotionally devastated divorced women who need to fill the holes in their hearts with Quick-N-Easy afghan patterns and bolts of flannel fabric printed with images of Garfield in various Thanksgiving costumes. The press release explained that JOANN is fully committed to serving this vulnerable community of women, whose mental and emotional well-being is greatly benefitted by basking in the extra-bright fluorescent lights and aggressively clove-heavy scented candles that the retailer has to offer. Whether they need to treat themselves a leisurely stroll down the aisle full of unfinished wood earring racks and mini birdhouses or spend a blissful half hour choosing between three enormous balls of color-changing chenille yarn, these brokenhearted women will now have exclusive, unfettered access to the life-giving craft supplies at JOANN for an hour each morning without having to encounter any happily married customers who might trigger painful memories of their past relationships.  The press release went on to add that during the store’s new divorcee shopping hours, shoppers can expect to hear curated playlists featuring songs like Natalie Imbruglia’s “Torn” and Selena Gomez’s “Lose You To Love Me”—music that will evoke the emotions of loss and redemption and will speed along the healing process that these women go through while deciding on a new keychain-beading project to immerse themselves in as a distraction from their sadness. Women with ailing hearts will find true sanctuary during these special morning hours, and they will receive grandmotherly hugs along with the usual macrame advice from the four-foot-nine elderly employee each location seems to have, giving the women the emotional support they need to turn their sadness into handcrafted works of folk art. Incredible! Whether a newly divorced woman needs to completely overhaul her fabric stash or just wants to look at the basket of junk by the checkout register that for some reason contains a giant Baby Bottle Pop and an iPhone case that says “Smile, It’s Halloween,” she can now do so at JOANN Fabrics in an environment tailored to her fragile emotional state. This is an amazing initiative by JOANN, and we’d love to see something at stores like DSW and Yankee Candle that serve a similar customer base."
"Yikes, Who’s Gonna Tell Him: This Hermit Crab Is Using A ‘Louie’ Season 3 DVD Case As A Shell",N/A,https://clickhole.com/yikes-whos-gonna-tell-him-this-hermit-crab-is-using-a-louie-season-3-dvd-case-as-a-shell/,"All right, well, this is awkward. We really don’t want to be the ones to intervene here, but somebody’s going to have to say something: this hermit crab is using an old Louie DVD case as a shell. Oof. Who’s gonna tell him? This hermit crab, who is living on a beach in Key West, clearly outgrew his old shell recently, and he seems to have taken up residence in a discarded DVD case for season 3 of Louie, Louis C.K.’s semi-autobiographical HBO series about living in New York City as a middle aged divorced dad. Unfortunately, the hermit crab is blissfully unaware that Louis CK is pretty much universally cancelled at this point due to years of sexual misconduct in the comedy community. While there’s nothing inherently wrong with living in a Louie DVD case, it’s nonetheless not a good look for the hermit crab, and someone needs to break the news to him, STAT.  Poor hermit crab. He looks so comfy in there.  The whole Louis CK cancellation thing is sort of a third rail topic, and we’d really prefer not to bring it up with this hermit crab. The poor creature clearly just needed somewhere to live, and we can’t fault him for picking a DVD case that washed up onshore. However, this particular DVD case advertises an episode of Louie where Louis CK literally does the same exact non-consensual sex stuff he was eventually outed for doing in real life, which is not ideal. We’d like to think it wouldn’t be too much trouble for this crab to extricate himself from the DVD case and find a nice shell to live in—or even just a DVD case from a less problematic comedian’s TV series, like Lady Dynamite, or SNL’s The Best Of Will Ferrell. But for that to happen, someone’s gonna need to have an awkward conversation with him first. God, how would you even go about trying to explain this to a crab? We truly don’t know. Hopefully someone finds a way to break the news to him soon, though, because surely this crab has no interest in being a walking billboard for a sex predator. "
Tackling The Student Debt Crisis: President Biden Will Give Every American A Free Minor In Digital Humanities From SUNY Oswego,N/A,https://clickhole.com/tackling-the-student-debt-crisis-president-biden-will-give-every-american-a-free-minor-in-digital-humanities-from-suny-oswego/,"More than 44 million Americans share a collective $1.5 trillion in student debt, and that number only continues to grow due to skyrocketing tuition prices and high interest rates. Fortunately, President Biden just signed an executive order that’s going to make life a lot easier for Americans seeking college degrees: the government will now give every American a free minor in Digital Humanities from SUNY Oswego. Awesome!  In a press conference earlier today, Biden announced that all U.S. citizens over the age of 18 will soon receive a diploma certifying the completion of 18 Digital Humanities credits at SUNY Oswego. With millions of Americans struggling to make payments on their student loans, a free minor that shows they’ve completed courses such as Digital Imagery Fundamentals and Ethics And Social Policy In The Digital Age will prevent our next generation from getting stuck with the kind of crippling debt that the generation before them endured.  “Students who would have taken out thousands of dollars in loans for a college education can now save their money instead and use their Digital Humanities minor to help secure job opportunities involving skills such as digital text analysis, digital mapping, and web design,” said the president. “At the very least, these minors should qualify all Americans for professional internships, which, while not full time jobs, would definitely provide the on-the-job experience and networking necessary to build a career in the field.” If this wasn’t already great enough, Biden went on to say that he’ll be helping out those who’ve already amassed college debt by giving them a Dean’s List certificate stating that their cumulative GPA in their Digital Humanities minor was at least a 3.8, and by presenting an award called “The Mark C. Heller Prize For Outstanding Work In Digital Humanities” to Americans with more than $100,000 in student loans. This is so great! A free Digital Humanities minor from one of the top SUNY satellite campuses is going to go such a long way towards helping the many Americans who would have otherwise gone to college only to find themselves saddled with terrible credit scores and payments they just couldn’t make. Well done, President Biden!"
‘This Is What You Should Call Him Now’: McDonald’s Has Announced It Has Changed Ronald McDonald’s Name To ‘INTENSITY’,N/A,https://clickhole.com/this-is-what-you-should-call-him-now-mcdonalds-has-announced-it-has-changed-ronald-mcdonalds-name-to-intensity/,"In order to stay competitive, companies are constantly looking for ways to keep fresh and adapt to the times, and it looks like the biggest name in fast food is doing just that by updating one of the most iconic fixtures of its brand identity: McDonald’s just announced that Ronald McDonald’s name has officially been changed to INTENSITY. Wow, this is truly the end of an era. Now it’s INTENSITY’s time to shine! McDonald’s announced the name change in a press release earlier today and has quickly begun updating all marketing materials, merchandise, and licensing agreements to reflect their clown mascot’s new identity as INTENSITY, discontinuing the Ronald McDonald moniker from here on out. Check out the press release in its entirety below: “McDonald’s is proud to unveil Ronald McDonald’s new name: INTENSITY. This is what you should call him now. Thank you.” In conjunction with the announcement, McDonald’s rolled out a series of billboards and ads around the country today to spread word of the name change, most of which feature a black-and-white photo of INTENSITY staring directly into the camera with no expression on his face. After decades of smiling and clowning around, it appears that the mascot formerly known as Ronald McDonald is now much more serious and zeroed in on his goals, trading his trademark happy wave for a steely eyed gaze and no-nonsense attitude.   Damn. INTENSITY has arrived, and he is ready to be the face of fast food for a whole new generation.  While it’ll undoubtedly take most of us a long time to get used to referring to the mascot by his new name, we’re sure that INTENSITY will grow on us eventually. Kudos to McDonald’s for taking a big swing and trying something new."
"Unsustainable Situation: The Pandemic Has Forced A Record Number Of Uptight, Fastidious Snobs To Move In With Their Carefree, Oafish Foils",N/A,https://clickhole.com/unsustainable-situation-the-pandemic-has-forced-a-record-number-of-uptight-fastidious-snobs-to-move-in-with-their-carefree-oafish-foils/,"With unemployment rates still staggeringly high due to the Covid-19 pandemic, many people have had to change their living situations in order to save money. Unfortunately, not all of those new living situations are a match made in heaven: The Pew Research center has confirmed that the pandemic has forced a record number of uptight, fastidious snobs to move in with their carefree, oafish foils.  Good God. These are the absolute last types of people who should be living together! The alarming study found that the number of snooty, tweed-and-khakis neat freaks who are living with crumb-speckled, unshaven schlubs is higher now than at any point since the Great Depression, leaving millions of Americans highly vulnerable to uproarious sitcom hijinks spurred by comically incongruous roommate dynamics. Despite the frequent clashes between pretentious snobs who require hours of silence in order to make a dent in their Kierkegaard reading and slackers who are ever-prone to spilling bong water on the very Kierkegaard volumes their roommates are futilely attempting to read, the financial strains caused by the pandemic have left these foils with no choice but to figure out a way to make it work until the end of their leases—that is, as long as the oafs don’t set off a bunch of fireworks and accidentally burn the house down first. “This pandemic has left many upper crust know-it-alls down on their luck after being laid off from jobs at posh publishing houses, or having narrowly missed out on prestigious academic grants that instead went to their nemeses, with no other option than to take on a Craigslist roommate who made the understatement of the year when they described themselves as ‘a little messy,’” said lead researcher Dr. Susan Gu. “And sadly, although these snobs frequently decree that they ‘won’t stand another night with a fool who thinks Play-Doh is the name of a philosopher,’ these living situations are often more permanent than they think, as, now a full year into the pandemic, only one in 30 snobs have managed to find a new roommate who actually has their own toothbrush and doesn’t just secretly use theirs.” Additionally, the researchers discovered that this statistic coincides with an uptick in the amount of dishes piled up in the sink attracting ants, as well as a severe increase in the number of unexplained stray dogs in the living room that have apparently been taken in as pets. However, it has had no impact whatsoever on the amount of wrestling pay-per-views watched at high volumes by the slobs, or the number of nights that the slobs’ best friends need to crash on the futon—two figures that remain remarkably consistent no matter how many chore charts or passive aggressive comments about poor hygiene their more pedantic roommates throw their way. Further, while the data showed evidence of rare occasions in which the snobs and slobs were able to put aside their differences and pleasantly knock back a couple of beers together, the researchers noted that those nights usually ended in some kind of utter catastrophe—such as the slob mistaking the snob’s grandfather’s ashes for Nesquik and drinking them, or the snob eating one of the slob’s homemade brownies without realizing there’s THC in it and proceeding to lose their mind—that caused the snobs to double down on their uptight ways in the ensuing months.  Yikes! This study just confirms what these mismatched odd couples should’ve known before signing onto the same lease: that no meticulous snob who is sent into an OCD spiral at the sight of a slightly askew rug should ever be stuck living with a disheveled boor who somehow thinks it’s okay to put his greasy pizza slices directly on the couch. Here’s hoping the pandemic ends soon, because there’s no way that these people can sustain these outrageous living situations for too much longer."
"Heartwarming! When This Terminally Ill Kid Made A Wish To Poke Around on LaKeith Stanfield’s Mobile Banking App, LaKeith Said Go For It",N/A,https://clickhole.com/heartwarming-when-this-terminally-ill-kid-made-a-wish-to-poke-around-on-lakeith-stanfields-mobile-banking-app-lakeith-said-go-for-it/,"There’s nothing better than a major Hollywood star who’s willing to take time out of their busy schedule to make another person smile, and here’s a story of celeb doing just that: when this terminally ill kid made a wish to poke around on LaKeith Stanfield’s mobile banking app, Lakeith said go for it. We’re not crying, you’re crying!  Ten-year-old Hunter Greenwell of Jackson, Mississippi has late-stage leukemia, and when the Make-A-Wish foundation reached out to him to see if he had a wish they could make come true for him, he immediately knew exactly what he wanted: to get his hands on LaKeith Stanfield’s phone and spend an afternoon leisurely perusing the various tabs and sections of his Bank Of America app. Thankfully, Make-A-Wish was able to contact LaKeith with Hunter’s request, and the generous Judas And The Black Messiah star wasted no time saying “Sure, that’d be fine.” A week later, Stanfield appeared at the hospital by Hunter’s bedside and used his thumbprint to log in to his mobile banking interface. He then handed the excited boy his iPhone and said, “Have at it, bud,” letting Hunter tap around in his mobile banking app while he sat off to the side watching an episode of Judge Judy on the hospital room TV. Hunter has unfortunately been through years of arduous cancer treatments, but all that pain melted away when he got the chance to scroll down to the “Account Info” section of LaKeith’s main checking account and click “View Account Number” to see the 12-digit code that the acclaimed film and TV star uses anytime he has to set up a direct deposit. The overjoyed Hunter then spent 15 minutes silently exploring the rest of the app, occasionally muttering things like “Wow, he went paperless,” and “Cash back on dining, that makes sense,” while LaKeith sat patiently a few feet away. According to Hunter’s grateful mother, the highlight of the visit was when Hunter took out a legal pad labeled “L. STANFIELD BANK STUFF” that he had clearly been saving for the day, and filled in a little section titled “RECURRING SUBSCRIPTION PAYMENTS” with a list of monthly charges LaKeith pays for things like Hulu, GQ Magazine, and the Headspace app. It’s unfortunate that Hunter had to endure such a terrible ordeal in order to meet LaKeith and scope out the budgeting tab on his banking app, but you wouldn’t have known he was suffering at all based on how excited and full of life he was during LaKeith’s visit. You could tell how much the day truly meant to him when, after timidly asking LaKeith if he could take a peek at his FICO score, the Sorry to Bother You star replied, “Yeah, knock yourself out,” eliciting a squeal of pure joy from the terminally ill boy, who then applauded gleefully upon discovering that LaKeith’s credit was holding strong at 796. Yes! It doesn’t get any more heartwarming than this. Kudos to LaKeith for giving up his iPhone for a little while to make a sick child’s dream come true. Here’s hoping this inspires more celebrities to use their influence for good. "
The Perfect Crime: This First Grader Has Been Taking Home Two Pockets Full Of Wood Chips From School Every Day And Hiding Them Behind The Washing Machine,N/A,https://clickhole.com/the-perfect-crime-this-first-grader-has-been-taking-home-two-pockets-full-of-wood-chips-from-school-every-day-and-hiding-them-behind-the-washing-machine/,"The idea of a perfect crime is something that’s been endlessly explored in works of fiction, but here’s a real-life story of a cunning little boy executing a plot that’s so brilliantly diabolical that not even the world’s most sophisticated intelligence agencies would stand a chance at unraveling it: this first grader has been taking home two pockets full of wood chips from school every day and hiding them behind the washing machine. Wow. This kid is truly a criminal genius. Given the large number of students and teachers concentrated in the general playground area during recess at Jerger Elementary School, the idea of stealing wood chips without being caught seems near impossible, but six-year-old Trevor Harmon of Dover, Delaware has been successfully pulling off such a scheme for over a week now without leaving a trace. The pint-sized mastermind made the first move in his ongoing heist early last week when, seizing on a momentary lapse in supervision as a recess aide was briefly distracted by a pushing match between some other students, Trevor quickly bent down and stuffed two handfuls of wood chips into the pockets of his shorts and then quickly covered up the bald spot on the ground with more wood chips to hide the evidence before rushing over to the seesaw to establish an alibi just as the recess aide turned back his way. Since getting away with it for the first time, Trevor has gone back and perpetrated the same ploy every single day since at recess, taking care to hold his hands over his pockets on the walk back to class to conceal the wood chip bulges without being detected by his teacher or, worse, Anya Coburn, the biggest tattletale in the grade.  But getting through the school day is only half the battle for Trevor. Every day when he gets home, he immediately tells his mom “I gotta go pee”—a clever lie, given that he typically has to go pee after school anyway—at which point he then runs downstairs to the basement, opens the door of the basement bathroom to make it sound like he’s going in, and then swerves off to the laundry area before discreetly stashing the wood chips in the gross dusty area behind the washing machine where no one ever looks. Yet on the off chance that his mom actually does look back there one day and find his loot, Trevor has a plan in place to blame the crime on his baby brother, a perfect scapegoat considering that he’s always picking dirty stuff up off the ground and doing naughty stuff like crying and hitting the family dog.  Unfortunately, due to the delicate nature of his crime, it is all but impossible for Trevor to enjoy his stolen treasure during daylight hours, but he is occasionally able to sneak down to the basement after bedtime, holding his breath so as not to alert his parents to his presence, and spend a few minutes pretending the wood chips are a big army of wood chip ninjas before scurrying back upstairs. Should he ever be caught in the act during one of these late-night missions, his plan is to stick his arms out like a mummy and pretend he is sleepwalking—a sly little trick he saw Patrick do on an episode of SpongeBob once.   Damn, he’s got everything planned perfectly. This kid is pretty much a real-life Bond villain!  While it might be a little too early to call this the crime of the century just yet, there’s no denying that Trevor is a criminal mastermind of the highest order. And though we can’t condone stealing, we also can’t deny that Trevor’s efforts are truly impressive, and we have to give him some respect. Kudos to this young evil genius!"
The Curse Continues: A Fifth Mule Has Drowned In The New England Aquarium’s Mule Tank,N/A,https://clickhole.com/the-curse-continues-a-fifth-mule-has-drowned-in-the-new-england-aquariums-mule-tank/,"Something truly unsettling is afoot on Boston’s Central Wharf, and it’s getting harder and harder to chalk it up to mere coincidence: A fifth mule has drowned in the New England Aquarium’s mule tank. Two or three could just be bad luck, but five? Something here isn’t right. Aquarium workers received a terrible shock today when their routine morning check of the exhibits revealed that the aquarium’s star mule, Chomper, who just the day before was playfully thrashing in the water and sputtering his trademark gasps, had mysteriously drowned at some point overnight. Worse still, this is far from the first such loss: Since its installation in late 2019, the mule tank has seen no less than four other mules meet sudden, tragic ends. Workers initially attributed the death of the first mule to old age, but suspicions were raised after an otherwise healthy young mule named Galileo died not longer after. A full autopsy was performed on Galileo’s body, and the surprise discovery of water inside his lungs brought aquarium officials to the troubling conclusion that something, or perhaps even someone, was drowning their mules. The whole thing sends a chill down your spine. Besides their obvious tragedy, these disturbing mule deaths also represent a serious threat to the aquarium’s finances, as roughly 40% of their annual revenue comes from their beloved “Acrobats of the Sea” trained mule showcases. People come from all over New England to see trainers gracefully balance on the mules’ snouts as they flounder through the water and clamber through hoops, but with Chomper’s death, it’ll be months before the aquarium can fully train his replacement. And while the Pet-A-Mule Tide Pools were once a reliable draw for families with younger kids, they sadly had to close down after a mule with no prior behavioral issues bit down unexpectedly on a girl’s ponytail in an attempt to pull itself out of the water, leaving the aquarium with even fewer ticket sales to fund the investigation into whatever terrible hex is currently plaguing the mule tank. “I helped design that tank myself, and I can tell you that every inch of it was configured to be an aquatic paradise for these mules,” said Dr. Stephanie McTavish, a marine biologist and the New England Aquarium’s resident mule expert. “We’re constantly monitoring the salinity and keeping the temperature at exactly 85 degrees Fahrenheit, pretty much the perfect conditions for mules, and we sink fresh bundles of hay for them daily, but somehow they keep turning up dead. It’s heartbreaking. Seeing mules gracefully flail around up close is a magical experience for children and adults alike, but I worry that if we can’t figure out what’s going on here, those familiar sounds of splashing and frantic, high-pitched braying may vanish from our aquarium forever.”"
Leading By Example: President Biden Will Get Circumcised On Live Television To Prove To Americans That It’s Safe,N/A,https://clickhole.com/leading-by-example-president-biden-will-get-circumcised-on-live-television-to-prove-to-americans-that-its-safe/,"In a time of unprecedented partisan division, with distrust of facts and science at an all-time high, it’s more important than ever for those in power to back their words with actions and lead by example, and it appears that the White House is aiming to do just that: President Joe Biden has announced plans to get circumcised on live television to prove to all Americans that it’s safe. No matter where you stand on the political spectrum, you can’t deny that this president is walking the walk!  In a press release earlier today, the White House revealed that the president will go on TV Wednesday evening and have his foreskin removed from his penis to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of circumcision to the American people, becoming the first sitting U.S. commander-in-chief to publicly undergo elective genital surgery. The procedure will be performed on Biden live in the Oval Office before a small audience of family, media members, and dignitaries, and it will be broadcast to all the major television networks in an effort to reduce the stigma surrounding circumcision, which has become increasingly controversial in recent years.  “There are numerous health benefits to cutting the hood of skin off of your penis, and I urge any Americans who may have reservations about having this done to tune in Wednesday and watch me prove that there’s truly nothing to worry about,” said Biden in the press release. “My administration believes in science, and science says that circumcision is completely safe. It also improves the appearance of one’s penis and allows one to engage in sexual intercourse with a new partner without first having to offer an awkward caveat about unsightly excess skin shrouding the glans.” Yes! It is so refreshing to once again have a president who practices what he preaches.  Props to Biden for stepping up to the plate here. The stigma around foreskin removal stands no chance against an administration as boldly committed to the safety of everyday people as this one is. With this kind of reassurance, you can bet that Americans will start lining up to get circumcised ASAP!"
Self-Care FTW: This Company Just Gave Its Staff A Full Week Off To Catch Up On Work Stuff,N/A,https://clickhole.com/self-care-ftw-this-company-just-gave-its-staff-a-full-week-off-to-catch-up-on-work-stuff/,"Now more than ever, employers are becoming more sensitive to their workers’ well-being, and this story is a prime example of how companies can look after their employees and make mental health a priority: this company just gave its staff a full week off to catch up on work stuff! So awesome! This is how you show your employees that you care. Prism, a digital marketing company based in Denver, Colorado, clearly knows how to take care of its employees’ mental health and wellness, because this week they generously offered each and every one of their staff members a full week of paid vacation so they could take some much-needed time to make progress on their never-ending work to-do lists.  “We know that the daily grind of meetings and assignments can really take a toll on people, which is why we felt it was important to give our employees some time off to just slow down, decompress, and knock out all the little work tasks they haven’t yet gotten around to yet due to more urgent projects we’ve needed them to prioritize,” said Prism CEO Tim Dyler. “We hope that the week off will give our team the mental space they need to recharge their batteries and start tackling all the work they’ve been neglecting with renewed energy.” Awesome! Numerous studies in recent years have found that giving employees more time off actually improves workplace productivity, and this is exactly the kind of result Dyler is hoping for in light of a series of cost-cutting measures and layoffs Prism made in the past year, forcing the company to start doing much more with less. The resulting increased workloads have undoubtedly left Prism’s employees more than ready to enjoy a full week to themselves at home with zero deadlines—just relaxed, unstructured time to clear their minds of their nine-to-five responsibilities and make a dent in some of the unfinished work that has been hanging over their heads and causing undue mental strain.  And if the time off wasn’t already generous enough, Prism recently announced plans to offer free weekly in-office yoga sessions to help give employees the inner calm they need to deal with anxiety related to the company’s extremely demanding and often exploitative workplace culture. This should be a huge boon for employee mental health, as the health insurance plan the company currently offers does not provide coverage for therapy visits or virtually any other type of psychiatric care.  Wow! Kudos to Prism for going above and beyond for its employees and investing in their mental health. Here’s hoping more companies start following their example by offering the time off their employees need to truly unwind and attend to the all the unfinished work that their livelihoods depend on."
Does She Think He Died? Oprah Winfrey Just Opened Up About The Final Conversation She Had With Tom Hanks,N/A,https://clickhole.com/does-she-think-he-died-oprah-winfrey-just-opened-up-about-the-final-conversation-she-had-with-tom-hanks/,"Sharing stories about the final conversation you had with someone who’s passed away is a wonderful way to keep their spirit alive, but it’s pretty baffling to do if the person hasn’t died. Case in point: Oprah Winfrey just opened up about the final conversation she had with Tom Hanks. Huh.  Earlier this morning, Oprah Instagrammed a black and white photo of herself and the Forrest Gump star taken at a Golden Globes after party with a long caption describing the conversation they had that night, like she’s completely under the impression that he just died and deserves to be commemorated. “Although I’ve always enjoyed the time I’ve spent speaking with the one and only Tom Hanks,” began Oprah’s caption, “had I known then that this conversation in January 2019 would be our last, I surely would have cherished it even more.” We have good news for you, Oprah. That doesn’t have to be your final conversation, because Tom Hanks is very much still alive.  “Our chat was mostly pleasant small talk—what projects we were working on and the recent rain in LA. But just as I thought our conversation had reached its end, Tom said something remarkably profound in that casual yet thoughtful way of his that I’m going to miss for the rest of my life” continued Oprah, even though that’s a pretty insane thing to say about someone if the person isn’t at least in a severe coma. “Tom gestured to all the beautiful people around us in fancy ball gowns and tuxedos and said that, while the celebrity lifestyle certainly has its perks, it doesn’t define us. It’s not who we are. He said that who we really are is determined by the people we love most, and the people we spend the most time with. In the months after he told me this, I kept meaning to reach out to him to tell him how much I appreciated the conversation, but sadly I never got a chance. If only I could speak to him one more time.” Okay, what the hell is Oprah talking about? We just googled it to make sure, and Tom Hanks is 100 percent not dead. He was the first big celebrity to get coronavirus—maybe she thinks he died from that? “Let this be a reminder to you to never let things go unsaid, because you never really know how much time you’ll have with someone,” concluded Oprah, before listing a series of hashtags including, “#TomHanks,” “#Love,” #Memories,” and “#NeverForget”—none of which are an outright “#RIP,” but the sentiment is definitely there.  Many commenters on the post seem to be taking Oprah’s words at face value, including Chrissy Teigen, who commented, “I am keeping his beautiful family in my thoughts and prayers. Sending so much love,” followed by a heart emoji. Pretty weird considering that Tom Hanks is not dead! Jesus. At this point we have to wonder if Oprah knows something we don’t, because it really seems like she’s being earnest about everything she’s saying. Here’s hoping someone on her team lets her know that he’s not dead sometime soon, because she should probably take this post down and save it for when he actually dies."
Fount Of Wisdom: This Person’s Worldview Is Gradually Being Shaped By Viral Tweets From TV Writers Whose Politics Are Entirely Based On Viral Tweets From Other TV Writers,N/A,https://clickhole.com/fount-of-wisdom-this-persons-worldview-is-gradually-being-shaped-by-viral-tweets-from-tv-writers-whose-politics-are-entirely-based-on-viral-tweets-from-other-tv-writers/,"Our world is overwhelmingly complex. Forming your own beliefs and values can be a lifelong process, and the answers to questions of right and wrong are rarely black and white. Luckily for social media user Kelsey Lusk, she’s found a powerful source of enlightenment to help guide the way: her worldview is gradually being shaped by viral tweets from TV writers whose politics are entirely based on viral tweets from other TV writers.  Truly, she has stumbled on an endless fount of wisdom! In recent months, Lusk has been logging onto Twitter every day to tune her moral compass to the hot takes of humorous TV writers who in turn set their own moral compasses to the hot takes of more successful TV writers who have mastered the art of reducing complex socioeconomic or political issues into one-dimensional issues that can be easily neutralized by deploying a clever tweet or reaction GIF. Lusk’s Twitter feed is like stepping into a modern-day School of Athens, transporting her into a vibrant intellectual playground where working screenwriters brilliantly skewer current events with whip-smart insights that mirror the popular consensus of people who have even more social media clout than themselves and have the courage to “punch up” at powerful figures such as controversial politician Donald Trump. Thanks to these thought-provoking—yet hilarious!—tweets from sage veterans of cutting-edge late night programs such as @midnight, Lusk is now equipped with all the retweets captioned “THIS” and memes espousing basic moral platitudes that she needs to navigate these troubled times.  While it can be difficult to trust what you read on the Internet, Lusk can feel confident that the wisdom she’s gleaning from these philosophical giants is well-informed. Blue checkmarks, validating replies from Andy Richter, degrees from Ivy League colleges, Twitter bios that vaguely associate the user with numerous digital comedy outlets like The Onion and Reductress—these writers boast lofty credentials, and Lusk can have peace of mind knowing that the opinions she’s retweeting are not only shrewdly calculated to generate as many LIKES as possible, but they’re also factually airtight. Additionally, she can confidently trust the ethical guidance she receives, as most of these writers she follows will eagerly condemn peers for old tweets containing racially insensitive jokes that they themselves also used to make but no longer do, having matured in character since those long-ago days of 2014 when TV shows could openly use the R word but everyone was okay with it for some reason. Indeed, these digital elders are living testaments to the fact that enlightenment is a journey, not a destination.  Lusk has already acquired many lifetimes of wisdom from these individuals she follows, and thanks to their pathological thirst for attention and validation, it seems that there will never be any shortage of new insights she can take away from her Twitter feed. Their views evolve with the world and the trending topics around them, and Lusk can feel emboldened on her own path of discovery by looking to these online mentors, whose guidance is indispensable when it comes to timely issues such as whether enough time has passed for one to replace #BLM in their Twitter bio with their writing credits.  What an exciting time to be alive! In an age of misinformation and partisan distrust, it’s wonderful to see these guardians of social discourse spreading righteous knowledge with razor-sharp one liners that are then disseminated to the masses through the retweets of eager young learners like Lusk. We can all rest easy knowing that the Truth is in the hands of these fearless TV writers and the more successful TV writers whose validation they so desperately seek. "
"They Are PISSED: Hanes Is Going Off On Twitter About How The Front Flap In Their Briefs Is For Warming Your Hands, Not Sticking Your Penis Through",N/A,https://clickhole.com/they-are-pissed-hanes-is-going-off-on-twitter-about-how-the-front-flap-in-their-briefs-is-for-warming-your-hands-not-sticking-your-penis-through/,"If you wear Hanes underwear, you might want to brace yourself, because it looks like the company has a serious bone to pick with its customers: Hanes just went off on a heated Twitter rant about how the front flap in their briefs is for warming your hands, not sticking your penis through. Damn. Hanes is really pissed! In an angry Twitter rant posted earlier today, Hanes revealed that they recently learned that virtually no one puts their hands inside the little slit in the front of their underwear to keep their hands warm, which the company says is its sole purpose. The clothing company, seeming equal parts frustrated and baffled over the revelation, held absolutely nothing back in an explicit series of tweets taking its customers to task:  Yikes! Rage tweeting is never a good look, and it’s doubtful that Hanes will win any new customers with this next-level tantrum. Here’s hoping that Hanes can move past this perceived slight and accept that not everyone is going to use their products exactly as the company might’ve envisioned. If you think about it, there are honestly lots of different ways one could make use of an underwear flap, and it would benefit Hanes to celebrate these myriad possibilities rather than shame the loyal customers who keep their company in business."
"What The Fuck, Those Aren’t For You: Mom Just Got A Fenty Bra",N/A,https://clickhole.com/what-the-fuck-those-arent-for-you-mom-just-got-a-fenty-bra/,"Get ready to feel uncomfortable, because Mom just made a highly questionable purchase that indicates that, even in her old age, she is apparently still a sexual being: Mom just got a Fenty bra. What the hell, Mom! Those aren’t for you. Mom, seemingly oblivious to the fact that Rihanna’s Fenty brand makes undergarments primarily worn by hot Instagram influencers in thirst traps, just texted you a slightly blurry picture of her new Savage X Fenty bra lying on her bed with the caption “My new bra….SO CUTE!!” Mom immediately followed up with another text saying, “Cannot wait to where [sic],” even though the only thing Mom does is go the grocery store, which is not exactly the place to wear a purple strappy balconette bra with a metal nameplate that reads “FENTY,” especially considering the garment will almost certainly be plainly visible through her white Coldwater Creek blouses. It’s unclear why Mom would feel the need to wear a push-up bra when the vast majority of her time is spent in the kitchen preparing various meals, but here we are.  Hmm. Fenty is big on body positivity and inclusivity, so, to be clear, it’s not like they would have a problem with a 64-year-old woman wearing their bras. But based on their provocative ads, it’s probably safe to assume that the company’s underwear wasn’t exactly designed with people who were alive for the Vietnam War in mind. Honestly, it’s shocking Mom even wants to wear a bra with a sheer panel surrounding the nipple, but if that’s what she wants instead of a modest full-coverage nude bra with extra cushioned straps to prevent sagging, who’s to stop her? Still kind of fucked up, though! Also, it’s unclear how Mom even found this bra in the first place. You’d have to be a pretty big Rihanna fan to know about Fenty since it’s only sold online, and although Mom always turns up “Umbrella” when it comes on Pandora radio, it’s not like she has her ear to the ground about Rihanna’s business ventures. Mom must have come across it when googling something like “new bra sexy” on her iPad, where presumably nowhere in the product description was it mentioned that these bras are more for cool girls to wear as going out tops than they are for postmenopausal women whose idea of a going out top is a rhinestone-covered cotton tee from Kohl’s. Seriously, what the hell is Mom thinking with this one? She needs to dress her age, not like Rihanna. Her new bra might honestly scare Dad. She needs to be careful with it. "
Justice At Last: This Man Was Just Released From Prison After Serving 25 Years For A Crime He Didn’t Even Feel Like Committing That Much,N/A,https://clickhole.com/justice-at-last-this-man-was-just-released-from-prison-after-serving-25-years-for-a-crime-he-didnt-even-feel-like-committing-that-much/,"Wrongful convictions are disturbingly common in the U.S. justice system, and far too often innocent people spend years wasting away in jail with no one to fight for their freedom.  Thankfully, here is a heartwarming story involving an unfair sentence that was recently overturned thanks to a group of dedicated activists: this man was just released from prison after serving 25 years for a crime he didn’t even feel like committing that much. Yes! It is little victories like these that give us hope that things can change.  In 1995, Brad Wylie of North Carolina was involved in an armed burglary and shooting that resulted in him spending more than half of his life in prison, even though he was honestly not even that into the whole thing in the first place. At the time of Wylie’s 1996 trial, he was assigned an overworked public defender, who unfortunately failed to introduce a key piece of evidence in the courtroom: security footage which captured Wylie’s accomplices perpetrating a vicious, violent crime in a small electronics store while Wylie mostly stayed out of the way and messed around with stereo equipment before reluctantly helping another perpetrator carry a speaker system out to the getaway car while audibly complaining about how heavy it was. Without this critical evidence at Wylie’s initial trial, jurors were left with the impression that he had been super jazzed about the events of that fateful night and accordingly found him guilty on all charges.   How tragic. This man lost 25 years of his life for his half-assed involvement in a crime he was pretty much indifferent towards. Throughout his decades-long ordeal, Wylie remained adamant that he had actually been more in the mood to chill on the evening of the crime, and never really cared one way or the other about armed burglary or felony murder.   “If I had been all pumped up to go rob and shoot somebody, sure, lock me up, but the truth is that I actually proposed we go see Major Payne in theaters instead because it had just come out and I thought the trailer was super funny,” said Wylie in a statement. “It was hard being away from my family and friends all these years due to a crime I didn’t even vibe with in the slightest. I didn’t want to steal a speaker system—I already had a pretty good one at home. I just wanted to go see a Wayans brothers movie.”   In 2015, legal activists from the Innocence Project received a letter from Wylie in prison, and they eventually agreed to take on his case. “It was clear that in terms of excitement towards the crime in question, Brad Wylie was probably at around a four or five out of ten, max,” said Nell Stevenson, an attorney with the organization.  Innocence Project lawyers and volunteers then set off on a tireless search for evidence that would exonerate Wylie, and in 2019 they uncovered just that. A paralegal combing through Wylie’s financial files came across a receipt for a rental of Blankman, another popular Wayans brothers movie from the time, time-stamped just an hour before the crime, clearly supporting Wylie’s testimony from the trial that his sole intention that evening was to watch some sort of Wayans brothers movie, and he only tagged along for the crime because he thought his buddies would catch a flick with him after. Wylie was granted a retrial where his lawyers were able to present this new evidence, and the North Carolina Supreme Court unanimously ruled to overturn his conviction, making him a free man. Wow. We can’t imagine the arduous ordeal Brad Wylie went through these past few decades, but we are extremely thankful that he is now able to start living his life again. This story reminds us that there are so many people sitting in prisons in the U.S. who probably never felt like breaking the law at all. It’s wrong, and we hope that more attorneys like Nell Stevenson will work to free these people and make our country a more humane and just place."
"Feminist Win! This Woman Is Wearing A Ton Of Makeup, Which For Her Is Way Braver Than Going No-Makeup Because She Is Fucking Terrible At Putting On Makeup",N/A,https://clickhole.com/feminist-win-this-woman-is-wearing-a-ton-of-makeup-which-for-her-is-way-braver-than-going-no-makeup-because-she-is-fucking-terrible-at-putting-on-makeup/,"It’s not easy living as a woman in a society where every aspect of your appearance is constantly scrutinized, but here’s a beautiful story that will inspire you to be bold and do your own thing rather than worrying about unrealistic beauty standards: this woman is wearing a ton of makeup, which for her is way braver than going no-makeup because she is fucking terrible at putting on makeup. Yes! This is so empowering—we have no choice but to stan! This morning, 28-year-old Rosie Brecker of Austin, Texas boldly stepped out of her house in a full face of makeup, which may seem like an attempt to conform to typical beauty standards, but is actually a super subversive, anti-beauty-culture act given that every time she puts makeup on it looks completely fucking awful. Despite living in an appearance-obsessed culture her entire life, Rosie somehow never quite figured out how liquid eyeliner works or what blush is really supposed to do, and now, every time she tries to do a clumsy cat-eye look or applies the too-bright lipstick she thinks gives her a sort of child-pageant-contestant vibe, it takes all the inner strength and confidence she has to step out in public and strut her stuff. Rosie knows for a fact that putting $150 worth of products from Sephora on her face makes her look at best like a confused preteen and at worst insane, but she is bravely sticking it to the patriarchy by looking god-awful in her makeup anyway! Go Rosie! Some women feel pressure to put on foundation, mascara, and lip gloss every single day just so they can hide their imperfections and look “good enough” to show their faces in public, but not Rosie. In fact, going bare-faced is way more of a safe choice for her, since the way she puts on base makeup actually makes her look like she has a skin condition. But according to a powerful post she recently put up on Instagram, she’s no longer content to play it safe. “Normally I don’t do this, but I decided to throw caution to the wind and put on foundation, concealer, mascara, eyeshadow, eyeliner, lipstick, and blush before going out today,” read the caption on Rosie’s courageous post. “And I’m posting a picture because I want women everywhere to know that you can still be your beautiful, radiant self in makeup, even if you’re absolute dogshit at putting it on. Yes, it makes me feel vulnerable to go out in public with blush that goes all the way up to my temples because I think I saw that in a magazine one time, but sometimes, a little vulnerability is better than a lot of perfection. So don’t be afraid to wear makeup, even if you’re a complete fucking idiot at it like I am.” Yes! Posting an awkward selfie of herself in almost clown-like makeup is actually far more impressive than any celebrity’s no-makeup pic, because the sheer lack of skill with which Rosie applied her new highlighter stick is a true slap in the face to the idea that women need to look flawless at all times. Rosie looks like straight-up garbage right now, and she is getting out there and taking up space like the messed-up eyeshadow queen she is. Get it, girl! Yep, this is giving us the confidence boost we need to get through the day. It’s so awesome to see a woman wearing bad makeup in a society that tells her every day that she can’t! Rosie, you are our hero—keep fighting the good fight, because you’re inspiring us in a major way."
"Goddammit, He’s Literally The Last Person Who Deserves This: A Caravan Of Royal Courtiers From Faraway Just Arrived In DC To Inform Mitch McConnell That He’s Been A Prince All Along",N/A,https://clickhole.com/goddammit-hes-literally-the-last-person-who-deserves-this-a-caravan-of-royal-courtiers-from-faraway-just-arrived-in-dc-to-inform-mitch-mcconnell-that-hes-been-a-prince-all-along/,"If you were hoping that one of the most malicious bastards in American politics would see some kind of comeuppance for the lasting harm he’s done to our country, we’re sorry to have to tell you that things are only getting better for him: A caravan of royal courtiers from faraway just arrived in Washington DC to inform Mitch McConnell that he’s been a prince all along. Goddammit. This is not how karma is supposed to work. The whole bullshit affair began earlier this afternoon when a group of about a dozen men clad in sumptuous robes of fine cloth approached the Kentucky senator outside the Capitol to ask if his parents had been Addison and Julia McConnell of Athens, Alabama. McConnell answered affirmatively, prompting the oldest of the men to ask if he perhaps had a distinctive crescent-shaped birthmark just below his left collarbone, which McConnell said that he did. After excitedly conferring among themselves for a moment, the whole group then knelt down in solemn obeisance and announced that there could be no mistaking that he was the long-lost prince of their distant kingdom, which honestly would have been a beautiful moment if it weren’t happening to such an irredeemable piece of shit. As they crowned him with a splendid emerald diadem and bestowed upon him an extremely badass heirloom sword, the courtiers went on to explain that McConnell had been spirited away as an infant to protect him during a period of great strife within the realm, and was left in the care of a childless American couple who vowed to keep his princely lineage a secret for as long as they lived. They then hoisted him aloft on a gleaming gold palanquin to be paraded around the Capitol, which means that in addition to already being one of the richest members of the senate anyway, McConnell now gets to be carried everywhere for the rest of his life, and you can see on his smug fucking face how much the asshole loves it. Christ, even Rubio would have been better. Fucking Ted Cruz would have been better!  It’s downright agonizing to see McConnell happily tapping his feet while his personal bard—which is a thing he has now!—sings a song about how their handsome and valiant prince has at last been returned to them. Here’s a guy who’s done everything in his power to stop Americans from having healthcare, and he’s watching a bunch of lithe, beautiful dancers perform in his honor while a courtier tells him that every single one of the dancers has asked for McConnell to make them one of his wives. Granted, it’s not like anyone could have known that McConnell would grow up to be an obstructionist asshole who has done more to immiserate the American people than almost anyone else living, but it’s still a real slap in the face to hear these guys tell him that his palace grounds include an aviary full of exotic birds and a personal orange grove in one of the courtyards. This weasley old prick ratfucked Obama out of an entire Supreme Court Justice, and now a huge, extremely cool-looking warrior guy is telling him that he’s his sworn sword and protector and exists only to serve his will. The courtiers even went so far as to yell at Ed Markey for passing by without showing appropriate reverence to their prince, which is pretty fucked up considering that he’s an objectively better public servant and human being in general. Man, everything about this absolutely sucks. It just goes to show that there’s simply no goddamn justice in the world in terms of who gets to discover that they’ve always been a secret prince."
"Prepare To Eat Shit, Food Dunce: This Man Thinks He Can Swap In His 10-Inch Springform Pan Where The Recipe Explicitly Calls For A 9-Inch Fluted Tart Pan",N/A,https://clickhole.com/prepare-to-eat-shit-food-dunce-this-man-thinks-he-can-swap-in-his-10-inch-springform-pan-where-the-recipe-explicitly-calls-for-a-9-inch-fluted-tart-pan/,"There are some lines you just don’t fucking cross when preparing baked goods, and one particularly egregious dipshit is about to learn the hard way that his actions have consequences: This man thinks he can swap in his 10-inch springform pan where the recipe explicitly calls for a nine-inch fluted tart pan. Un-fucking-believable. Truly a historic milestone in kitchen dumbassery.  Until about five minutes ago, amateur baker Ryan Stromberg was a normal man living a respectable life, but by deciding to use his 10-inch springform in open defiance of the tarte au citron recipe he’s currently attempting, he has chosen to throw all that away in order to enter a remedial dimension of pure and unrelenting dogshit. Nevermind the fact that the suggested baking time and ingredient measurements were made specifically for a nine-inch fluted tart pan—this ignorant bastard’s unconscious drive for punishment far outweighs his capacity to visualize the cracked, dried-to-hell abomination to which he is negligently playing midwife. Taken in a vacuum, Stromberg’s preparation of the tart shell’s pâte sucrée might seem competent, perhaps even skilled, but a single look at the 10-inch springform awaiting use on his counter indicates that the King Imbecile of Desserts here is all but gleefully aiming the pan equivalent of a shotgun at the tart equivalent of his skull. Does he think using the springform will make it look “rustic” or something? Does he legitimately believe he knows better than the recipe? Or does he do this purely to inflict as much suffering and anguish on actual bakers as he possibly can short of filming himself beheading Mary Berry? Whatever the case, the man is going to waste four good lemons on his recipe-defying trainwreck, and for that alone he is a deserving candidate for lobotomy. Watching him so arrogantly plow ahead towards certain lemon tart destruction, you can’t help but feel an urge to backhand him across the face and scream, “HEY THERE, FUCKO! HOW THE HELL ARE YOU GOING TO TRIM AWAY THE EXCESS SHORTCRUST PASTRY TO FORM AN EVEN EDGE AFTER BLIND BAKING? MAGIC? YOU’RE FUCKED, DUDE! YOU HAVE DUG YOUR OWN INCORRECTLY SIZED GRAVE! YOU FUCKED AROUND WITH FORCES BEYOND YOUR UNDERSTANDING AND NOW THAT 10-INCH SPRINGFORM PAN IS YOUR FUCKING COFFIN. MAY THE SCOURING SANDS OF MEMORY ERASE EVERY LAST VESTIGE OF YOUR EXISTENCE SO THAT YOU CANNOT STAIN THE DIGNITY OF BAKERS ANY LONGER, YOU DEAD-EYED PIG-BRAINED BITCH! CASTRATE YOURSELF WITH A FIVE-SPEED HAND MIXER NOW TO SAVE MANKIND FROM YOUR TOXIC GENETIC LEGACY!” Good fucking riddance. Sadly, the damage is done now, and soon this moron will have to reap the rotten harvest of his infinite fucking ignorance. His tart, without question, is going to be a disaster of Hiroshima-like proportions. Blech.

Novak, The Make-A-Wish Foundation Gave Her A List Of More Impressive Celebrities They Have Access To",N/A,https://clickhole.com/heartwarming-when-this-terminally-ill-kid-asked-to-meet-b-j-novak-the-make-a-wish-foundation-gave-her-a-list-of-more-impressive-celebrities-they-have-access-to/,"The Make-A-Wish Foundation has brought happiness to hundreds of thousands of children in its decades of operation, and its latest move proves that the organization is still as committed as ever to helping kids in need: When this terminally ill kid asked to meet B.J. Novak, Make-A-Wish Foundation gave her a list of more impressive celebrities they have access to. Wow! Way to go above and beyond, Make-A-Wish! Last week, 11-year-old Ellie Ryker, a late-stage leukemia patient, received the incredible news that she could request whatever wish she wanted and the Make-A-Wish Foundation would make it happen. It didn’t take Ellie long to decide that she wanted to meet The Office writer and occasional cast member B.J. Novak, and that’s when the organization sent her back a list of significantly more famous celebrities that she could meet instead, reminding her that they have the resources to make her wildest dreams come true and that she really shouldn’t feel bad about asking for something cooler. “Ellie, while we too enjoyed B.J. Novak in his numerous appearances on The Office and in his tertiary role in 2013’s Saving Mr. Banks, we just thought we’d reach out and make sure you wouldn’t rather meet one of the more big-league celebrities we partner with,” began the letter from Make-A-Wish. “Like what about JoJo Siwa? Or Taylor Swift, or even Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Johnson? Again, B.J. Novak is perfectly fine and all, but we just checked his Wikipedia and it looks like he’s pretty much just making weird, unsuccessful iOS apps these days. Not exactly what you’d call a ‘working actor.’”  “Like, if you just chose B.J. because you’re a fan of The Office but were worried it’d be too much of an ask to request the show’s stars, please know that this is definitely not the case,” the letter continued. “Want a day with Steve Carrell or Mindy Kaling? We can make that happen. In fact, not only could we get you either of those two, but we could probably get B.J. to tag along as a bonus. Just ask for whatever you actually want, and then we’ll throw in B.J. for the heck of it.” The letter went on to gently remind Ellie of the sad fact that she is indeed terminally ill, which means this is likely her last and only chance to do something cool like this, so it’d really be in her best interests to not hold back at all as far as wishing goes.   Heartwarming! Kudos to Make-A-Wish for pulling out all the stops to bring Ellie joy and to make sure that whatever she wishes for isn’t something she’ll spend her final days regretting. Not that there’s anything wrong with B.J. Novak, but, c’mon. Dream bigger, kid!  "
Missing His Old Routine: This Man Just Wants Quarantine To End So He Can Go Try On Clothes At Red Lobster,N/A,https://clickhole.com/missing-his-old-routine-this-man-just-wants-quarantine-to-end-so-he-can-go-try-on-clothes-at-red-lobster/,"If you’re starting to get seriously sick of being stuck in lockdown, prepare to feel all the feels, because you’re definitely going to relate to this story about someone who is desperate to get out of the house and experience life’s simple pleasures again: this man just wants quarantine to end so he can go try on clothes at Red Lobster. Ugh, yes. We feel this 100 percent. The pandemic seriously needs to end, STAT! Brent DeBoer of Raleigh, North Carolina has spent the past year working from home and restricting his trips out of the house to the absolute essentials, and at this point, he’d give almost anything to go back the everyday pre-Covid activities he took for granted, like enjoying coffee dates with friends, working out at the gym, and showing up at his local Red Lobster with a shopping bag full of Izod polos and spending a relaxing evening trying on the shirts one by one in the restaurant bathroom’s handicapped stall. Before the pandemic, it never even occurred to Brent that there might come a day when he would not be able to walk into to his favorite seafood chain, order a single Cheddar Bay biscuit, and then ask his waiter to help button him into a short-sleeved collared shirt and take pictures of him on a disposable camera he brought from home. But sadly, Brent has not had the chance to do so in nearly a year, and every time he walks by a Red Lobster, he feels a pang of sadness for the old, pre-2020 days, when trying on swim trunks at a restaurant was a weekly occurrence, not a distant dream. Yep, we all miss the way life used to be too, Brent. Take us back to the before times! Since the pandemic began, it’s been a discombobulating time to say the least, and by now we’ve all accepted that there are some basic human interactions that are out of reach for us right now. But that doesn’t make it any less painful for Brent to accept that, instead of parading through a Red Lobster dining room in a new suit from the adjoining Men’s Warehouse and asking for other patrons’ opinions by round of applause, he has to order the same suit online, then put it on, and then log into Omegle to get feedback from strangers, many of whom are total weirdos. Life just isn’t the same when you can’t casually visit an elderly neighbor without wearing a mask, stroll through grocery store aisles without worrying about a deadly virus, or sashay into a Red Lobster to try on clearance sweaters and feed the ones that don’t fit to the lobsters in the lobster tank. But sadly, that’s just the reality we have to accept for the foreseeable future.  Pretty much all of us can relate to Brent’s frustrations in one way or another, and it’s nice that we can at least all go through this trying time together. Let’s get our vaccines and end this thing for good so we can all do those simple things we love again. And until then, stay strong, everybody!"
Hard To Watch: This Man Is Pathetically Searching His Empty Box Of Chocolates For A Second Layer,N/A,https://clickhole.com/hard-to-watch-this-man-is-pathetically-searching-his-empty-box-of-chocolates-for-a-second-layer/,"If you have poor self-esteem and would like to feel a little better about yourself, here’s a story of a man doing something so astoundingly pitiful that it’ll immediately make you feel better about your own miserable situation: This man is pathetically searching his empty box of chocolates for a second layer. Oof. Desperation is not a good look! The downright painful ordeal began when fully grown man Louis Ducomb ate what was very clearly the last piece of the Harry & David assorted chocolate truffles box he had recently been regifted by a family member who didn’t want it. Rather than eat the candy in a dignified manner, however, he instead shamelessly wolfed down everything in the box within half an hour, and once he’d finished all the visible chocolates—including the weird yellow-ish nut-speckled ones he doesn’t even like but nonetheless ate—he immediately began rifling through the empty paper cups left in the box in a hopeless and frankly barbaric effort to uncover a possible second layer of chocolates, as if he lives in some Willy Wonka-esque fantasyland in which more candy is somehow lying in wait behind every opaque surface. He truly seems to believe that fumbling around with the edges of the plastic liner at the bottom of the box is going to pay off in a hidden trove of extra chocolates any second now, like the box’s emptiness is a sentient, benevolent force that he is capable of bargaining with. No doubt if the family member who regifted Ducomb the box of candy had known he’d wind up like this, hunched ogreishly on his couch, shirt covered with sprinkles, feverishly groping around the empty box as a mindless reflex of having gone more than 30 seconds without sugary matter in his gaping maw, they’d have sooner smothered him with it than let someone they care about so irreparably degrade himself. There but for the grace of God. To be clear, there are absolutely boxes of chocolate that contain second or even third layers of chocolates, but Ducomb is choosing to ignore a wealth of evidence indicating that this is obviously not one of those cases. The nearby lid clearly states that the box contains 20 pieces, all accounted for in the first layer’s four-by-five layout, and the remaining empty space beneath the liner could not possibly contain more chocolates of the same size as the ones he just boorishly devoured without violating all known principles of three dimensional geometry. If he wanted to, the poor lout could put himself out of his misery simply by picking up the box and realizing that its weight alone definitively precludes the possibility of further sweet treats, but in his vast, seemingly limitless disgrace, he is opting not to do so. Woof. Get your shit together, man! It is deeply depressing to watch an adult human being debase himself like this, and we pray to God that we never get anywhere near this point in life. Here’s hoping he gives up on his hunt for another layer of chocolates soon, because we’re not sure how much more secondhand humiliation we can take. "
"Body Positivity Win: Schick’s New Ad Campaign Argues That Women Don’t Have To Shave To Be Beautiful, But They Still Need Schick Razors For Self Defense",N/A,https://clickhole.com/body-positivity-win-schicks-new-ad-campaign-argues-that-women-dont-have-to-shave-to-be-beautiful-but-they-still-need-schick-razors-for-self-defense/,"If you love hearing about big name companies that are making body positivity a priority, this awesome story is sure to put a smile on your face: Schick just released a new ad campaign claiming that women don’t have to shave to be beautiful, but they still need Schick razors for self defense. So awesome! This is body positivity at its finest! This week, Schick released a series of advertisements with a simple but powerful message: though women don’t need to get rid of their body hair to feel worthy and attractive, they should continue buying Schick razors to use as weapons in the event of an attack on their person. The empowering campaign includes several must-watch commercial spots that are feminist AF. In one, a woman is shown examining her growing underarm hair in a bathroom mirror with a smile, then looking down her Schick razor with a shake of her head. Just as she goes to throw the razor in the trash, a masked intruder bursts into her bathroom, and she whips around and uses the razor to slit his throat. As the attacker falls to the ground, blood spurting from his neck, the woman turns to the camera and delivers one of the campaign’s awesome body positive slogans: “Natural body hair is a good look, but getting murdered isn’t. Use your Schick to stay safe!” Wow. It’s so heartwarming to see advertising used to spread an amazing message like this one! The ads also highlight Schick razors’ unmatched self defense features, like five-blade technology that ensures a clean swipe at your attacker’s jugular, and an ergonomic rubber handle that is easy to grab from your purse or pocket in the event of an assault. “When you find yourself in a hairy situation, Schick’s there to help you kill,” reads one print ad, which shows a woman with visible body hair brandishing a Schick at an attacker in a darkened alleyway. Yes, yes, and yes! This is how you do body positivity in 2021! Kudos to Schick for using their platform to push the progressive message that, though women do not need to shave their body hair to conform to ridiculous beauty standards, they absolutely do need razors to fatally subdue attackers. So powerful! Here’s hoping the rest of the beauty industry starts joining Schick in empowering women with the weapons they deserve!"
Amazing Innovation! Boston Dynamics Invented A Robot That Says ‘Stop It’ When You Sneeze,N/A,https://clickhole.com/amazing-innovation-boston-dynamics-invented-a-robot-that-says-stop-it-when-you-sneeze/,"Over the years, Boston Dynamics has firmly established itself as the biggest name in robotics, and it looks as if its latest innovation might completely change the industry forever: the company has unveiled a new robot that says “stop it” when you sneeze.  Unbelievable!  The five-foot-tall humanoid robot, named Scold, is quite possibly the most advanced bipedal automaton ever developed, equipped with state-of-the-art sensory technology that allows it to detect any sneezes within a 25-foot radius and immediately bark, “Stop it. I don’t like that.” If a person continues sneezing after Scold tells them to cut it out, the robot will then activate its groundbreaking hydraulic actuator system to shake its head and angrily mutter, “Disgusting, just disgusting,” to itself. “After ten years of development and over $200 million in DARPA funding, we are thrilled to present Scold, the world’s first-ever humanoid robot capable of acting incredibly annoyed when people sneeze in its vicinity,” said Boston Dynamics in a press release. “Never before has there been a robot that can scoff after it sees a person sneeze into their hands and then wipe their hands off their pant leg, which is just one of Scold’s many functions that completely raise the bar in terms of the humanistic behaviors that can be replicated by androids.” The statement went on to say that Scold’s design features a revolutionary locomotion system that facilitates lifelike movement of the robot’s 32 unique joints, allowing it to realistically roll its eyes and passive-aggressively hand you a tissue from a box stored inside its chest cavity if you just keep loudly sniffling after a sneeze without bothering to blow your nose. The robot will then wait in front of you until you actually blow your nose, at which point Scold will respond, “Was that so hard?” before prancing away at an impressive gait of 1.5 meters per second. The robot is also able to go down stairs.  So cool!  Although Scold is just a research prototype and is not designed for commercial use, we seriously hope that this amazing little guy is one day made available to the public, because we would seriously fork over all our money to have one around during allergy season. Hats off to Boston Dynamics for once again coming out with a game-changing innovation—we can’t wait to see what they come up with next!"
A Wench’s Worst Nightmare: This Wench Is Hardly What You’d Call Buxom,N/A,https://clickhole.com/a-wenchs-worst-nightmare-this-wench-is-hardly-what-youd-call-buxom/,"Being a servant girl is hard enough as it is, but it’s especially miserable to be stuck in such lowly circumstances without any of the natural gifts you need to help you get by. Case in point: this wench is hardly what you’d call buxom. Poor girl. What an unfortunate hand for a wench to be dealt! Born into a life of servility and woe, Elizabeth Doyle has for years earned meager wages filling tankards of ale for local drunks. Yet in a line of work where one must use their looks to earn tips, the 23-year-old is at a great disadvantage, as you’d be hard-pressed to describe her as “chesty” or “shapely” or “a well-be’bosomed lass.” Doyle’s situation is truly the stuff of a wench’s worst nightmares: she is not the plump, apple-cheeked type that leaves barflies hooting coarsely with excessive activity of blood and nerve but rather a wench of the more pallid, deflated sort—one whose mere flat-chested presence quiets the rowdy clank of a fellow’s privates down to a flaccid murmur. If the acreage of her bosom were more vast and pillowy, she would surely bring in the tips she needs to afford a room of her own and some small creature comforts. But alas her sorry teats have consigned her to a life of poverty, with only a small corner of her father’s shack to call her own, which she retreats to after long days of mopping and toiling to stare into her broken looking glass and lament her childlike orbs.  Ay, though Doyle is indeed a kindly wench of good Christian repute, it is clear to all who have eyes that she will never be the sort of bonny lass of robust proportion whose kiss the townsmen covet. In fact, not even the old, widowed miller, who hasn’t had a woman in years, is willing to extend her a desirous wink or a slap on the rear as she passes by with her tray of steins. And it’s all because she lacks what is a wench’s sole consolation in life: a shapely, heaving figure that stirs the private apparatuses of men and inspires them to part with their coins. As the old saying goes, “A wench of vacant blouse must suffer etern’ly,” and Doyle is no exception. Her yoke is heavy, and so it shall be for as long as she has breath.  O, this pitiful wench!  Why God chose to curse Doyle so is beyond our comprehension, but it is our duty to trust in His plan and know that it is right. We pray that Doyle may one day find a man to give her his seed, as perhaps then her bosom will grow full and round with milk and relieve her of her burden. Godspeed, wench."
Possible ‘Malcolm In The Middle’ Revival? Frankie Muniz Just Whispered ‘Prepare’ Before Vanishing From His Containment Chamber During A Power Failure,N/A,https://clickhole.com/possible-malcolm-in-the-middle-revival-frankie-muniz-just-whispered-prepare-before-vanishing-from-his-containment-chamber-during-a-power-failure/,"Get excited, Malcolm in the Middle fans, because the beloved show from the early aughts just might be getting a reboot: Frankie Muniz just whispered “prepare” before vanishing from his containment chamber during a power failure.   Whoa. Could this mean that we’re finally going to see more hilarious hijinks from Malcolm and his brothers? Technicians at the government laboratory where Muniz has been held in stasis since the 2006 finale of Malcolm In The Middle confirmed today that the actor has completely vanished from their custody, somehow managing to free himself from what is said to be one of the most secure and tightly guarded facilities on the planet. According to reports, the actor suddenly jolted awake at some point late last night and cryptically whispered the word “prepare” just moments before all of the power in the building and its three backup generators completely cut out, leaving the facility pitch-black and silent except for the eerie patter of wet feet scurrying from the containment ward. When power resumed, Muniz’s chamber was busted open and vacant, with shrapnel from its impenetrable steel hydrolock system strewn about the area, leaving fans hopeful for a reunion of their favorite dysfunctional TV family.  Roger that, Frankie. Now how about you “prepare” us some new episodes? While it would have been awesome if Muniz gave us more hints—perhaps using the thick, hose-like oxi-tubes that deliver nutrients to his vital organs to spell out something like, “MALCOLM 2021 HBO MAX”—a spokesman for the facility says that security footage from the unit offers no additional insights, as it just shows Muniz suspended motionlessly in his cryogel before the power cuts out and the tape stops recording. Additionally, the guards noted that Muniz was the only specimen in the facility who managed to escape from his containment chamber, so, bad news, Paul Giamatti fans, but it doesn’t look like we’re going to be getting a Big Fat Liar reboot, too.  While it’s still too early to make any definite conclusions about Muniz’s remarkable escape, all the signs seem to be pointing to a possible Malcolm in the Middle revival, so fingers crossed! Be sure to keep your eyes peeled for new developments in the coming days, as Muniz will undoubtedly be working quickly to execute his plan, knowing that the full might of the U.S. military is being deployed to ensure that he is recaptured and safely contained once again."
Self Care FTW: Joe Biden Just Announced That He’s Going To Stop Pressuring Himself To Be Hyper-Productive During The Pandemic And Instead Just Focus On His Mental Health,N/A,https://clickhole.com/self-care-ftw-joe-biden-just-announced-that-hes-going-to-stop-pressuring-himself-to-be-hyper-productive-during-the-pandemic-and-instead-just-focus-on-his-mental-health/,"While stuck at home in quarantine this past year, countless Americans have felt pressure to be especially productive so that they can make the most of their time in lockdown. However, there’s no single correct way to cope with a pandemic, and it’s important to look after yourself and do what’s best for you, even if you’re the leader of the free world: President Joe Biden just announced that he’s going to stop pressuring himself to be hyper-productive during the pandemic and instead just focus on doing what’s best for himself. Yes! It’s okay to not be okay right now, and it’s so nice to have a president who realizes this! At a press briefing earlier today, Biden revealed that he will no longer be pressuring himself to perform at 100 percent every single day during the pandemic and will instead focus more on prioritizing his mental health. The president explained that he feels that in order to truly care for the country he must first learn how to care for himself, and he believes he can do so by distancing himself from the “rise and grind” culture that has long defined his political life and giving himself the space he needs to “relearn how to find joy.” “This pandemic is a marathon, not a sprint, and I’ve realized that sometimes I need to allow myself the grace to forego tasks that I might not have the emotional bandwidth complete at a given moment,” said the president, adding that adjusting to this new normal is hard enough as it is without having to stress about things like stabilizing the global economy and preventing nuclear war. “I’ve been pressuring myself so hard to come up with the perfect executive orders and to have all these incredibly productive cabinet meetings and to all-around just maintain a ‘normal’ workload when we’re living through a time that’s anything but normal. This is a time of unprecedented collective trauma, and I’m realizing now that it’s perfectly okay to sometimes just stop what I’m doing, curl up in a ball, and cry. I can give myself the time I need to grieve and replenish, and when I come back, all the treaties and wars and existential crises will still be there. And even if I don’t deal with all those things totally perfectly, I am still enough.”   Biden went on to explain that even though it might seem like quarantine is a good time to put the pedal to the metal and figure out exactly the direction the country needs to take for the next four years, it will actually be better in the long run if he accepts that now is not the best time, mentally, for him to be pushing himself beyond his capacities. “Making some tea and listening to a mindfulness recording on my meditation app rather than preparing for a meeting on vaccine rollout might at first feel like the wrong choice, but it’s actually what’s going to keep me sane and healthy and in the right headspace I need to be in to do what’s best for this country,” he continued while lighting a palo santo stick to cleanse the energy in the White House briefing room. “Sometimes you’ve just gotta say ‘no’ to high-stakes phone calls with belligerent foreign leaders and ‘yes’ to phone calls with your therapist. There’s no guilt in that. Focus first and foremost on replenishing your own emotional inventory, and then you can confront Bashar al-Assad about gassing his own citizens. That’s what I’m finally figuring out, and I trust you all will respect how I choose to go about my personal journey.”   Well said! Treat yourself, Mr. President! Kudos to the president for understanding that, actually, things are really hard right now, and there is no blueprint for dealing with all the big feelings of this moment in time. Here’s hoping he continues giving himself all the self-care he needs to effectively lead us through this unyielding crucible of death and disease that has upended life as we know it!"
A Bit Underwhelming: Universal Studios Just Announced Its Only New Attraction This Year Is A Yellow Slide With ‘Mr. Krabs’ Written On It,N/A,https://clickhole.com/a-bit-underwhelming-universal-studios-just-announced-its-only-new-attraction-this-year-is-a-yellow-slide-with-mr-krabs-written-on-it/,"The business model of theme parks has always been dependent on constantly developing bigger and more exciting attractions in order to keep luring visitors back through the gates, but this year it looks like one of the biggest names in the industry is phoning it in just a bit: Universal Studios just announced that its only new attraction this year will be a small yellow slide with “Mr. Krabs” written on it. Huh. That’s it? Pretty weak…. For the past several months, rumors have been circulating about what was being erected behind a giant wall of scaffolding at Universal Orlando, with some speculating it could be an expansion to the park’s popular Marvel Super Hero Island. But all those hopes were squashed when the company revealed earlier today that it is just a seven-foot-tall plastic yellow slide with the name of the SpongeBob SquarePants character Mr. Krabs’ scrawled on the side in what appears to be permanent marker. Don’t get us wrong, a SpongeBob-themed section of the park modeled after the show’s fictional underwater city Bikini Bottom could definitely be a lot of fun. But this new Mr. Krabs ride seems to be nothing more than an unremarkable yellow slide erected in the middle of an empty concrete lot with nothing else in the immediate vicinity except a plastic grocery bag loosely tethered to a traffic cone for guests to stash any personal items they don’t want falling out of their pockets as they go down. “Look, the past year hasn’t been easy for us with Covid and everything, and this is really the best we can do right now given the circumstances,” said the company in a press release. “But, hey, at least we gave you all that awesome Harry Potter stuff a few years back! And we’ve still got all your favorite rides like the Transformers one with the 3D Megatron and the classic E.T. ride where E.T. says your name at the end—everyone loves that one! And to be clear, we think the Mr. Krabs ride can still be pretty fun if you go into it with the right attitude. Just think of it like you’re sliding down Mr. Krabs’ claw onto his belly, or zipping down a hill in Jellyfish Fields while Mr. Krabs chases you with a belt. It can be whatever you want it to be if you use your imagination!” The company added that visitors will also get the opportunity to interact with SpongeBob and Squidward characters while waiting in line for the ride, although promotional photos on the Universal Studio website suggest that these “characters” are merely an old dish sponge with googly eyes glued to it and a bucket of calamari that you’re permitted to submerge your hand in. Further, guests will have the option to purchase a souvenir photo of them going down the slide that the ride operator takes using a five megapixel 2004-model Canon digital camera and then prints out on a black-and-white laser printer that is clearly running low on toner.  God, they really did half-ass it this time around. Oh well! Maybe next year Universal will give us something truly worthwhile like a Fortnite VR ride, or maybe some sort of dinosaur adventure to tie into the upcoming Jurassic World sequel. Until then, you might be better off planning a family vacation around the Disney parks, as you’ve gotta imagine their new features are a bit more exciting than a plastic slide themed around a not-that-important character from the SpongeBob universe.

Readjusting To Civilian Life: Donald Trump Keeps Accidentally Shitting All Over The Floor Because His Mar A Lago Toilet Is In A Different Place Than The White House Toilet He’s Used To,N/A,https://clickhole.com/readjusting-to-civilian-life-donald-trump-keeps-accidentally-shitting-all-over-the-floor-because-his-mar-a-lago-toilet-is-in-a-different-place-than-the-white-house-toilet-hes-used-to/,"Any major change in life always requires a bit of getting used to, and according to a new report, it seems that is especially true when you’re coming down from being the most powerful man in the world: Sources say that Donald Trump keeps accidentally shitting all over the floor because his Mar A Lago toilet is in a different place than the White House toilet he’s used to. Sounds like ol’ Donny’s having a rough time readjusting to civilian life! Multiple sources close to the former president say that since leaving the White house, Trump has been absolutely wrecking the carpets at Mar A Lago at least “six or seven times a day” as he struggles to adapt his sphincteral muscle memory to his new surroundings. Sources confirm that it is now a fairly common occurrence for the 74-year-old to abruptly stand up wherever he is, drop his pants and underwear to his ankles, and announce “It is time for me to do brown in my fabulous presidential toilet,” at which point he will then absentmindedly stagger 15 paces to the left—the exact distance between the Resolute desk and the Oval Office restroom—and expressionlessly drop a large mess of feces onto the carpet. He will then, just as at the White House, make no effort to flush.  “The smell hits you like a brick wall the second you walk into Mar A Lago,” revealed one senior aide under the condition of anonymity, adding that while the housekeeping staff has been working diligently to clean the carpets, Trump’s infamous beef-centric diet generates far too much feces in a given day for them to keep up. “If Jared or Ivanka are here, they’ll gently redirect him to the proper facilities, but otherwise no one really has the balls to correct him. He’ll just mutter something like ‘This is where my toilet is’ and empty his bowels right where he’s standing, and then he’ll brag to whatever Mar A Lago members are around that he gets to use ‘the same toilet that George Washington brought to the White House from France.’”  The source went on to reveal that Trump’s eldest sons, Donald, Jr., and Eric, have also begun voiding their bowels on the Mar A Lago floor, seemingly in an effort to prove their loyalty to their father. While openly defecating on the ground might seem like yet another example of Trump defying long-established norms as he so often did during his presidency, sources insist that there’s nothing political about this behavior and that he “really just does not realize that his new toilet is in a different spot than his old toilet.” And with a much smaller Secret Service detail now than he had when in office, this pattern of shitting on the carpet may continue indefinitely, as Trump appears to need a fleet of staffers at the ready to offer him support with locating the lavatory.      Very gross! To be fair, it must be quite the adjustment to suddenly go from being the leader of the free world to being just a citizen with no executive power, and certainly other former presidents have struggled with this change in their own specific ways. So we’ll give him the benefit of doubt on this one. But here’s hoping the ex-POTUS can quite literally get his shit together and figure out where his new toilet is before his carpet cleaning bills get out of control."
Innovation FTW! Toyota Is Printing Dick Van Dyke’s Face On Their Airbags So That If You Get In An Accident It Looks Like Dick Van Dyke Is Bursting Out Of Your Steering Wheel To Kiss You,N/A,https://clickhole.com/innovation-ftw-toyota-is-printing-dick-van-dykes-face-on-their-airbags-so-that-if-you-get-in-an-accident-it-looks-like-dick-van-dyke-is-bursting-out-of-your-steering-wheel-to-kiss-you/,"The No. 1 most important thing to look for when buying a new car is safety, and one automotive manufacturer just unveiled an innovative new safety feature that’s guaranteed to give you peace of mind every time you get behind the wheel: Toyota will begin printing Dick Van Dyke’s face on its airbags so it looks like he is bursting out of your steering wheel to kiss you when you get into an accident. Amazing! Toyota is truly setting a new standard for car safety! In a press release earlier today, the company announced that every new Toyota model will now come equipped with NHTSA-certified airbags embossed with a lifelike digital print of Dick Van Dyke’s face contorted into a comforting, wide-eyed grin. In the event of a collision, Toyota boasts that the airbags will not only greatly reduce the risk of head and neck injury, but they’ll also give the flattering impression that a 95-year-old Emmy winner and World War II veteran desperately wishes to kiss you, thereby distracting you from the terror of the accident and whatever gruesome injuries you may have suffered.  “Our industry-leading team at the Toyota Research Institute devoted over five years and $250 million towards developing this revolutionary new technology, allowing motorists to hit the road for the first time ever with the assurance that the elderly star of Chitty Chitty Bang Bang could burst out of the steering column and smooch them at any time,” said the press release. “The airbags will come synced with Toyota’s industry-leading impact-detection technology, offering additional protection to drivers by alerting them to imminent collisions via a recording of Van Dyke screaming ‘GET READY, JACKASS, BECAUSE I AM GOING TO KISS YOU!’ taken from a 1979 Tonight Show interview with Johnny Carson.” To promote the feature, Toyota has rolled out a powerful new commercial in which we see a 16-year-old girl going for a drive in her new Toyota while we hear a voiceover from her father reflecting on the challenges of letting one’s child grow up and become independent while still wanting to protect them, at which point we suddenly see his daughter get into a terrible collision. We then see harrowing slow-mo footage of the airbag erupting out of the steering wheel and Dick Van Dyke’s ancient, rapidly inflating face rocketing forth to plant a big ol’ wet one on the child as she ragdolls from the collision, after which we then cut back to the father, who lets out a big sigh of relief and says, “While she’ll always be my little girl, I can at least take comfort knowing that wherever the road takes her in life, a nearly 100-year-old celebrity will always be there to kiss her when she needs it most.”  Wow…we are definitely getting a little misty-eyed over here!  Kudos to Toyota for putting consumers’ safety first.

PBS Is Re-Releasing The Banned ‘Magic School Bus’ Episode Where The Class Shrinks Down And Tails Ms. Frizzle’s Boyfriend To Find Out If He’s Cheating On Her,N/A,https://clickhole.com/90s-kids-rejoice-pbs-is-re-releasing-the-banned-magic-school-bus-episode-where-the-class-shrinks-down-and-tails-ms-frizzles-boyfriend-to-find-out-if-hes-cheating-on-her/,"If you grew up in the ‘90s, you definitely watched A LOT of The Magic School Bus. However, there’s one infamous episode you probably haven’t seen, but get excited, because it looks like that’s about to change: PBS is re-releasing the banned Magic School Bus episode where the class shrinks down and tails Ms. Frizzle’s boyfriend to find out if he’s cheating on her! Awesome!  The controversial episode, titled “The Magic School Bus Exposes Mike’s Lies,” first aired in 1995 and immediately drew ire from thousands of parents who complained that it dealt with inappropriate subject matter and had nothing to do with science whatsoever. The episode began with a bang when Ms. Frizzle burst into the classroom in sweatpants and a wine-stained tank top, herded all her students onto the Magic School Bus, and pulled a lever that shrank the entire thing down to microscopic size, telling the class that it was time for “a lesson in getting what’s coming to you.” When Arnold yelled “Oh gosh, is this another field trip?” Ms. Frizzle just nodded and floored the gas pedal, blasting the microscopic bus across town to her boyfriend’s high-rise apartment building, where she instructed the kids to keep their eyes out for “a balding loser who thinks he’s hot shit even though he’s 35 and still working at Circuit City.” Now that PBS is finally adding the censored episode to their streaming app, 90s kids will get to watch as the microscopic School Bus gang surreptitiously follows Ms. Frizzle’s boyfriend Mike from his place to the drugstore down the block, where Ms. Frizzle tasks Phoebe and Carlos with checking to see if he purchases any condoms, and has Keesha and Dorothy Ann climb up his jacket to sniff for unfamiliar perfume. Major Magic School Bus fans will be delighted to find that the banned episode still contains the scandalous line in which Keesha asks, “Wait, Ms. Frizzle, shouldn’t we be doing a science experiment?” and Ms. Frizzle replies, “No. I don’t give a shit about science right now. Shut up or I will give you a bad grade.” The episode is also notable for being the only one where Ms. Frizzle refuses to dismiss her students at the end of the school day, instead forcing them to stay long after school hours to spy on Mike while he bar hops around town, buying drinks for several different women who the kids are later ordered to put together “revenge dossiers” on in their lab notebooks in lieu of normal homework.  In the final shot of the episode, Keesha shrugs and says, “Well, It’s never a normal field trip with the Frizz!” while Carlos points excitedly through a bar’s front window at Ms. Frizzle’s boyfriend leaving with an unidentified blonde woman, prompting Ms. Frizzle to mutter “That motherfucker” under her breath and take a big pull from a flask before speeding off in the wrong direction down a one-way road. Whoa! Sounds exciting! While it would’ve been awesome to have watched this in class back in the ‘90s, at least we’ll finally get a chance to see it now. We can’t wait to find out how Ms. Frizzle deals with her deadbeat, philandering partner!"
Absolutely Not: This Kid Is Trying To Bring A Stick Inside,N/A,https://clickhole.com/absolutely-not-this-kid-is-trying-to-bring-a-stick-inside/,"Well, here’s a situation that someone’s going to need to nip in the bud ASAP, because what’s unfolding is absolutely not okay: this kid is trying to bring a stick inside. Nope, nuh-uh, no way. Sticks are for outside. That is the rule.  Just now, four-year-old Bennett Martens was running around his front yard with a two-foot-long stick he found on the sidewalk, and unfortunately for everyone involved, Bennett has apparently decided that he needs to bring the stick into the house with him. Though Bennett’s mother has already warned him not to bring the stick indoors, explaining that there’s “no telling what kind of germs or filth might be on that thing,” the child has brazenly refused to back down, as he claims the dirty stick is his “favorite toy ever” and it needs to “live in his room.” There is no denying that Bennett is indeed fond of the stick, but this does not change the fact that sticks are not, and have never been, inside toys. This should not even be up for discussion. If Bennett is old enough to know the alphabet and to help his dad drive the lawnmower, then he is certainly old enough to know basic stick etiquette. There is absolutely no precedent for keeping a stick inside the Martens family home, but it appears as though Bennett will not stop until he gets his way. Just moments ago, he narrowly evaded an attempt from his mom to take the stick from him, forcing him to retreat and take sanctuary in his Cozy Coupe car, where he is currently having a tantrum and occasionally screaming about how he wants to “sleep with the stick in [his] bed.”  Sleeping with a loose stick just rolling around in your bed? Are you nuts, kid? There could be dog poop or ants on that thing!  Shame on this child. Bringing a stick inside is absolutely unacceptable, and he should know better. This isn’t what big boys do. He’s behaving like a baby. Here’s hoping that his parents give him a timeout, as Bennett clearly needs a little quiet time to reflect on his actions and reassess his priorities re: sticks. "
Nature Is Amazing! Researchers Have Determined That Birds Can Still Fly If You Zip A Bunch Of Them Up Inside A Duffel Bag,N/A,https://clickhole.com/nature-is-amazing-researchers-have-determined-that-birds-can-still-fly-if-you-zip-a-bunch-of-them-up-inside-a-duffel-bag/,"The more we learn about nature, the more incredible it gets, and a groundbreaking new discovery about avian flight is truly blowing our minds: Researchers have determined that birds can still fly if you zip a bunch of them up inside a duffel bag. Incredible! According to the bombshell study published yesterday in the academic journal Science, birds zipped up inside of a medium-to-large-sized duffel bag generally retain enough of their capacity for flight to propel the duffel bag as much as three feet off the ground, and are further able to slowly fly the bag around a small area for hours at a time. The study details how researchers initially expected their tests to demonstrate that being stuffed into a duffel bag completely negates birds’ ability to fly, but were stunned to find that eight seagulls crammed in a closed duffel bag were able to raise the bag to waist-height and hover across the laboratory before setting themselves down on an empty chair. And while the seagulls exhibited significant reductions in speed and maneuverability while jammed in the duffel bag, mostly just lurching around aimlessly and crashing into obstacles, they were nonetheless able to reliably achieve liftoff pretty much any time the scientists loudly blew whistles at them to frighten them into flapping their wings.  “Obviously you can’t do studies on this scale without losing some birds to things like asphyxiation or panic-induced frenzies of bird-on-bird disembowelment, but thanks to generous funding from the aerospace sector, we never had any shortage of specimens to aid us in conducting this vital research,” said Yale’s Dr. Elizabeth Ballentine, the lead researcher behind this incredible discovery. “This patronage has allowed us to indulge our every curiosity: What happens if we knock the duffel bag around with hockey sticks during flight? Could zipping a predator such as a fox or snake in with the birds motivate them to fly higher? Will the birds still fuck when densely packed into a pitch-black enclosure with 86 of their fellow bird friends? Of course it will take more time and more birds before we can answer these questions completely, but we’re very encouraged by the results we’re already seeing, and we believe we’re just scratching the surface of all the valuable insights we can learn from this extraordinary phenomenon.” While the team initially centered their research around seagulls, an unexpected $92 million grant from the NIH allowed them to expand the scope of their work to include other bird species, most of which also demonstrated the ability to fly when inside a duffel bag, albeit with some fascinating variations in behavior. Owls, for instance, were able to float the duffel bag around completely silently, without generating the terrified screeching sounds produced by most other types of birds. Geese managed to arrange themselves into their distinctive V formation when divided into multiple duffel bags in the same room. And though normally flightless penguins were still unable to fly when zipped up in a duffel bag, they were impressively able to gently propel the bag around the ocean floor when tossed in the water, which was not the case for species like hummingbirds and cardinals when similarly tested.  Amazing!  There is still so much left to learn about the world around us and the marvelous creatures that inhabit it. This is hands down one of the coolest animal behaviors we’ve ever seen. We can’t help but feel pretty lucky that we get to share our planet with creatures as incredible as birds!"
The IOC Has Officially Removed Track & Field Events From The Olympics After Realizing They Mostly Just Consist Of Losers Hopping Around Throwing Sticks And Random Shit,N/A,https://clickhole.com/the-ioc-has-officially-removed-track-field-from-the-olympics-after-realizing-that-half-the-sport-is-just-losers-hopping-around-throwing-sticks-and-random-shit/,"It’s still unclear whether this year’s Summer Olympics in Tokyo will actually take place, but if the Games do in fact move forward as scheduled, it looks like there will be some notable absences in the slate of events: the International Olympic Committee has announced that track and field events will no longer be a part of the Games after realizing that all the sports are basically just a bunch of losers hopping around throwing sticks and random shit.  Wow! This actually makes quite a bit of sense.  The IOC announced the decision in a statement released earlier today, saying that the events are more like “weird hobbies” than actual sports, as there’s a lot more to real sports than just “running fast in a straight line or throwing shit really hard.” The Committee argued that the sports were invented by ancient Greek individuals “who weren’t even smart enough to figure out toilets yet,” and it’s bizarre that we’ve been humoring these “dumb ideas from a pederast culture” for over 13 centuries when it’s long been perfectly clear that “virtually no one is interested in watching scrawny white guys in leotards jumping over a pole.”   “Look, at this point these sports really just exist so that high school kids who can’t hack it at normal sports can have something to pad out their college applications—the only people who care about the sports are the athletes themselves,” said the IOC in their statement, adding that “people aren’t exactly packing stadiums to watch shot put guys throw rocks kind of far.” “You can be the best athlete in the world at one of these sports and still have to work a full-time job to get by. The Michael Jordan of discus is probably working a register at Home Depot right now, and that’s because discus is a lame-ass yard game that no one wants to sponsor or buy tickets to watch. Shit’s embarrassing. We can’t have garbage like this stinking up the Olympics anymore.” “Honestly, some of these sports straight-up feel like daycare for grownups, what with all the guys jumping in literal sandboxes and flopping around on big blue pads and shit,” the statement continued. “It’s literally just the same shit little kids do to keep busy outside. We’re cringing over here just thinking about it. Those athletes need to grow the fuck up and do something worthwhile with their time.” The IOC went on to concede that the “Usain Bolt-type races are kind of fun to watch,” but they also noted that those races “only last for, like, 10 seconds,” and they “can’t justify renting out a whole goddamn stadium just for a couple 10-second races that we already know the Jamaicans will win.” The sanctioning body then revealed that they had considered condensing several of the more popular track disciplines into a single event simply called “running” where athletes compete to run as fast as they can for as long as they can, but ultimately the decision was made just to scrap the track stuff altogether, as “literally no one watches this stuff except during the Olympics, so it’s probably way more trouble than it’s worth.” The IOC then concluded their statement by saying, “Seriously, discus? What the fuck is that even?”  Gotta hand it to them, the IOC is making some pretty good points! But what do YOU think? Do you think the Olympics should continue including all the weird-ass shit where a bunch of random-ass nobodies you’ve never heard of hop over various objects and throw sticks and all-around behave like jackasses? Or do you agree with the IOC’s position that the Olympics should only host real sports that people are actually interested in watching? Let us know in the comments!"
Body Positivity Win: Dove Has Changed The Name Of Their Company To ‘Fat People Soap’,N/A,https://clickhole.com/body-positivity-win-dove-has-changed-the-name-of-their-company-to-fat-people-soap/,"It’s no secret that Dove has been absolutely crushing it in the body positivity game, but their latest move truly goes above and beyond towards making people feel comfortable in their own skin: Dove has officially changed the name of their company to “Fat People Soap.” Awesome! It’s so amazing to see a brand pull out all the stops to help people love their bodies!  Earlier today, Dove put out a statement announcing a top-to-bottom rebrand as Fat People Soap, a change that the company explained was necessary in order to be inclusive towards consumers whose bodies aren’t a perfect size zero. The personal care company went on to say that while it’s always been their mission to make people feel beautiful despite what society’s narrow beauty standards might tell them, they’ve come to realize that the name “Dove” doesn’t explicitly convey that goal and that any ambiguity in their branding could potentially deter consumers from loving their bodies no matter what the scale says. Hence, Fat People Soap. “We hope that the message of Fat People Soap will inspire everyone who uses our products to love themselves just the way they are,” said the company in the statement. “Whether they’re using Fat People Soap body wash, Fat People Soap lotion, or Fat People Soap hair care products, we hope that consumers will feel proud of what they look like every time they see the Fat People Soap label, because Fat People Soap is so much more than great products—Fat People Soap is empowerment.” The company formerly known as Dove followed the announcement by dropping a powerful new commercial spot that will definitely leave viewers misty-eyed. In the emotional ad, we see a woman in the shower washing her body with soap. Afterward, a scientist in a lab coat asks her to describe the experience, and she says that it wasn’t easy because she doesn’t like her body, and she feels like a fraud when she uses most soaps because she isn’t as thin as the models in their advertisements. The scientist then says, “What if I told you that you were using Fat People Soap?” The woman then bursts into joyful tears and says, “This soap accepts me just the way I am, and perhaps I should too. Thank you, Fat People Soap, for showing me how to love my body.”   Beautiful! Kudos to Fat People Soap for boldly embracing body positivity in a way that no other brand has before. Here’s hoping other companies will follow in Fat People Soap’s footsteps in rejecting society’s unrealistic standards of beauty and empowering consumers to realize that they’re perfect just the way they are."
A Match Made In Heaven: This Dog And This Other Dog Have Decided To Have Sex With Each Other Because They Are Both Dogs,N/A,https://clickhole.com/a-match-made-in-heaven-this-dog-and-this-other-dog-have-decided-to-have-sex-with-each-other-because-they-are-both-dogs/,"Everyone dreams of one day finding their perfect match, and here’s a story that proves that sometimes dreams really do come true: This dog and this other dog have decided to have sex with each other because they are both dogs. Wow. It’s like something straight out of a fairytale!  It’s only been 20 minutes since this Australian Shepherd and Collie first met in a serendipitous encounter out at the park, but thanks to the simple fact of them both being dogs they’re now conjoined in frenzied sexual intercourse as though they’ve known each other their entire lives. It’s truly remarkable how at ease they seem intertwined in a writhing mass of fur together, in no small part because of how mutually supportive they both are of their partner’s life goal of having sex with something. Shared interests are an important foundation for any partnership, and these two are so 100 percent on the same frequency about raucous dog sex that it feels like fate itself ordained them to wind up as an item. Part of what makes these lovebirds feel so right together is how well they’re able to work through adversity—It briefly appeared that they were heading for a rocky patch when the Collie threw up during the sex and they both tried to eat it, but in a true testament to the resilience of their union they immediately forgot about it and went back to having sex because dogs don’t really care about anything for more than about five seconds. Even when their owners tried yelling at them to stop, these dogs didn’t miss a single, spasming thrust. They’re simply lost in the rapturous delight of meeting one’s soulmate, which for a dog is basically any other dog that will accept penetration with minimal resistance.  It seems like Cupid’s arrow has found its mark with these furry little lovebirds!  This is all especially beautiful when you consider that the Australian Shepherd was just coming off a string of failed attempts to have sex, first with one of the park’s water fountains and then with a deflated basketball he found lying near one of the trashcans. He was probably almost ready to give up on love, but then he ran into the Collie and determined she was also a dog, and now they’re going at it so loudly that passersby are looking at them and wondering if they’re hurting each other. It just goes to show that it’s never too late to find another animal who can satisfy your every desire by having broadly compatible genitals because they belong to the same species as you, and frankly, we can’t help but get a little misty-eyed thinking about it. It’s hard to imagine a more complementary pair than these dogs going to town on each other at the park. Here’s hoping we all can meet someone who makes us as happy as they make each other by having sex as a direct result of the single precondition of both being dogs! "
Wasted Potential: Researchers Have Announced That Apes Could Probably Talk If They Gave It Any Effort At All,N/A,https://clickhole.com/wasted-potential-researchers-have-announced-that-apes-could-probably-talk-if-they-gave-it-any-effort-at-all/,"Gorillas, chimpanzees, and other members of the ape family are incredibly majestic creatures that are often touted for their intelligence, but a group of researchers just dropped a major bombshell that suggests these animals aren’t quite living up to their full potential: Biologists at Stanford have announced that apes could probably talk if they gave it any effort at all. Damn, sounds like apes have really been half-assing it. Time to step it up, fellas! The researchers announced their findings earlier this week, revealing that after years spent testing the physical, mental, and social capacities of various ape species, they are confident that the animals are intentionally holding out on us as far as being able to talk goes. Noting that the apes are extremely perceptive and capable creatures who have independently developed highly complex social structures and survival strategies, the researchers posited that there’s nothing holding them back from figuring out how to speak except their own laziness.    “If a bunch of apes got together and spent just, like, half an hour moving their mouths around and making noises and pointing at different objects, our research suggests that they would almost certainly figure out how to say a few things,” said lead researcher Gregory Euler. “Chimpanzees share over 99 percent of their DNA with people. They’re literally just little hairy humans, and we’re supposed to believe that they can’t even say ‘Hi’? That’s complete bullshit. They for sure can.” The research team cited the observation that most primates “are pretty much the size and shape of five-year-olds, and five-year-olds can talk no problem,” as one of the main tentpoles of their theory, going on to report that the animals “are able to use tools to forage for food, which is honestly way harder than just opening your mouth and saying ‘I’m a gorilla’ or something to that effect.” Further, the researchers argued that if Koko, the recently deceased gorilla widely known for her communication skills, was able to learn sign language so well, then surely her fellow apes could quit running around the jungle shrieking nonsense and instead figure out how to string some sentences together if they just spent an afternoon working at it.  Fascinating! This research makes it clear that apes have all the tools they need to figure out verbal communication, and now it’s just up to them to step up to the plate and start using their words. Apes, the ball is in your court. Show us what you can do, you lazy fucks!"
Hell Yes: These Orphans Are Reclaiming Mush By Opening A Fancy Mush Restaurant On The Same Street Where The Headmaster Once Served Them Mush Every Day,N/A,https://clickhole.com/hell-yes-these-orphans-are-reclaiming-mush-by-opening-a-fancy-mush-restaurant-on-the-same-street-where-the-headmaster-once-served-them-mush-every-day/,"Get the tissues ready, because this is an incredible story about a group of impoverished children who are taking a source of pain from their difficult past and turning it into something truly amazing: these orphans are reclaiming mush by opening a fancy mush restaurant on the same street where the Headmaster once served them mush every day! Wow! These kids are taking back mush in a major way, and it is empowering AF! While they’re now owners and operators of the hot new restaurant The Mush Shop, it was only a few years ago that these amazing orphans were toiling hopelessly in a working house north of London, slaving away under the watch of the portly, unfeeling Headmaster Tenleywhip, who would feed each child but a meager bowl of mush each day and nothing more. At the time, the orphans were ashamed to be seen crouching in gutters eating their watery rations, listening to posh Londoners call them “filthy urchins” as they passed by in their chic finery. But incredibly, they have since succeeded in completely flipping the script, having pooled all their street-sweeping money to rent out a small storefront on the same corner as their old boarding house where they now sell premium gourmet mush to thousands of people a week at fine-dining prices! These inspiring children could’ve easily opted to leave their painful mush memories behind and build an entirely new life for themselves, but they instead chose to wield the very substance of their poverty and dress it with premium toppings to sell at a major markup—turning the taste of oppression into the flavor of success.   In just six months since opening the business, the ragtag gang of fatherless boys has managed to create a restaurant so popular that not even the Headmaster himself can land a reservation—a fact that clearly infuriates him to no end, as every time he encounters the children on the street now, he turns beet-red and pivots away with an embarrassed huff. Upper-class Londoners who previously would’ve never been caught dead eating gruel are now going to great lengths to snag a table at the exclusive spot, where right past the front door the orphans have proudly hung the dirty rag they used to suck on after sopping up the last dregs of their hot cereal. Even Little Henry Prattle, the wee, malnourished orphan who used to tap dance for spare pocket change on the very corner where the restaurant now stands, has become fat and rosy-cheeked thanks to the success of the boys’ venture.  So inspiring—and appetizing! This incredible rags to riches story is a heartening example of what can happen when you take the forces that are holding you back and use them to your advantage. We wish all the best to this group of orphans and their high-end mush restaurant—well done, lads!"
The Fuck Else Could He Have Going On Today? Dad Is Currently Pushing You Off The Phone Even Though You’re The Young And Interesting One,N/A,https://clickhole.com/the-fuck-else-could-he-have-going-on-today-dad-is-currently-pushing-you-off-the-phone-even-though-youre-the-young-and-interesting-one/,"Well, here’s a WTF moment that’ll definitely leave you scratching your head for days: Dad is clearly trying to end your phone call with him despite you being the young and interesting one. Uh, what? That’s not how this goes, Pops. Just moments ago, Dad interrupted you in the middle of your weekly check-in call with him and said, “Hey, that’s great, son, you’ll have to tell me more at another time”—speaking in a distracted sort of tone that clearly indicated he was not really listening to you and was growing increasingly eager to get off the line. This took place after several instances of him mumbling “Mmm hmm” while you were talking, which he typically only does when he is bored and disinterested, like when he’s having a conversation with Grandma. This truly makes zero sense, though, as you’re infinitely more interesting than Grandma, and Dad typically laps up whatever bullshit you spout at him, as this is the duty of a parent. Clearly, something is up with Dad here, because the rules of a Dad call are pretty well-established: you talk about all of the fun things going on in your life, your fascinating hobby projects, and your important work, and then you cut him off because you’ve got better things to do than listen to him ramble on about refinishing the countertops or whatever. That’s the way this is supposed to work, and has for years until today’s curveball. Could dad legitimately have something else going on today? Probably not, and almost certainly nothing more exciting than interacting with a young person. He’s worked at the same company with the same guys for 20 years and been married to Mom for 37 years, and his entire existence revolves around repeating all the same mundane routines he established decades ago. It’s not like he does activities, and even if he did have something noteworthy on his agenda, he 100 percent would’ve told you about it on last week’s call. Something about this just doesn’t feel right.  After all, you’re the one who’s got dates and parties and a fucking social life, not him! How could a guy who usually has nothing to update you on except whatever happened in the latest episode of American Pickers possibly work up the gall to bail on you? Like, no offense, but these calls are really entirely for his benefit. You’ve got much better things to do than talk on the phone with an old person, but you nonetheless regularly carve out time to do so because you realize that your parents love you and they get sad when they don’t hear from you. Plus, you figure it’s an even trade for him paying for your college. But apparently he sees it differently.   Fuckin’ parents, man. They’re out of control.  Whatever. If Dad wants to suddenly act like he’s too good to talk on the phone with his kid, that’s fine. You don’t need to humor him anymore. But good luck finding another young person who’ll put up with rambling stories about home repair projects and Grandpa’s health issues. Not gonna happen, old timer!"
"Sort Of Heartwarming: This Kid With Terminal Cancer Wrote A Will Where He Left All Of His Toys To Daniel Tiger, Which Is Super Sweet, But It’s Going To Be An Absolute Legal Nightmare For His Parents After He Dies",N/A,https://clickhole.com/sort-of-heartwarming-this-kid-with-terminal-cancer-wrote-a-will-where-he-left-all-of-his-toys-to-daniel-tiger-which-is-super-sweet-but-its-going-to-be-an-absolute-legal-nightmare-for-his-p/,"Well, here’s a story that has the potential to totally warm your heart but also might give you a headache once you start thinking about it: This kid with terminal cancer wrote a will where he left all of his toys to Daniel Tiger, which is super sweet and all, but it’s going to be an absolute legal nightmare for his parents after he dies. Wow. This is a truly touching gesture that unfortunately will not make the grieving process any easier for the kid’s parents.  Owen Pearce, a five-year-old from Chapel Hill, NC, who is currently battling end stage leukemia with only weeks to live, is completely obsessed with the PBS series Daniel Tiger’s Neighborhood, so much so that he recently made the adorable decision to write a will dictating that all his toys should be left to the show’s titular character upon his passing. However, Owen signed the will in front of two of his nurses, which legally makes them witnesses and therefore renders the document as binding and valid in a court of law—leaving his parents no choice but to spend countless hours during their son’s final days consulting with an expensive probate attorney on how to go about executing the boy’s dying wish. While it’s unbearably sweet to see Owen cradle his Daniel Tiger plush stuffed animal in his hospital bed and tell it how it’s “going to get to meet the real Daniel Tiger one day,” the reality is that that’s just not going to happen. Since Daniel Tiger is a fictional cartoon character, the items will go to the show’s creator and executive producer Angela Santomero instead. This makes Angela the de facto executor of the will and the one responsible for filing it with the court within 30 days of Owen’s death. But because Angela has no idea who Owen is, Owen’s parents will now have to contact her via their lawyer in order to inform her of the burden coming her way, at which point she herself will have to hire a lawyer so that she can accept the responsibility and begin the months-long probate process. Additionally, because Owen did not specify which toys he wanted to give away when he wrote “all my toys go to Daniel Tiger” in crayon on a piece of construction paper, his parents will now have to attempt to separate which things belonged only to Owen and not his siblings so that the court can put the items through probate and determine their value before they go to Angela. Any mistake they make to properly submit items to the court could be cause for a lawsuit, which they definitely cannot afford, especially up against a successful Hollywood producer who could presumably hire the best lawyers money can get. Yikes. This is definitely not something that’d be fun for parents to figure out while dealing with the death of a child. Unfortunately, this story seems like it will only get less and less inspiring as Owen’s parents continue forging through this process, as they’re rapidly accumulating massive legal fees on top of the crippling debt they’ve already taken on from the countless medical bills they’ve accrued during their son’s hospital stay. It’s an upsetting situation for them to be stuck in, but oh well, guess that’s how things go sometimes. The reality is that not every story can be 100 percent uplifting, and unfortunately Owen’s parents are now learning that the hard way."
Deeply Troubling: Nickelodeon Confirmed That The ‘Legends Of The Hidden Temple’ Guards Got To Keep The Kids They Captured,N/A,https://clickhole.com/deeply-troubling-nickelodeon-confirmed-that-the-legends-of-the-hidden-temple-guards-got-to-keep-the-kids-they-captured/,"Pretty much every ‘90s kid has fond memories of watching the heart-pounding game show “Legends Of The Hidden Temple,” but some new revelations about the show suggest that the whole operation may have been more sinister than we realized: Nickelodeon has confirmed that the “Legends Of The Hidden Temple” guards got to keep the kids they captured. Yikes. This is quite troubling, to say the least. Nickelodeon released a statement earlier this week admitting that the show’s Mayan sentinel guards, who would pop out and capture tween contestants who didn’t have Pendants of Life to pay them off, were permitted to take the children home and keep them forever as their property. The network explained that this is how the guards were compensated for their time.    “Before filming each episode, the contestants would gather around Olmec and listen to him explain that if they were grabbed by a guard while trying to navigate the Dark Forest or find the Shrine Of The Silver Monkey, they would be taken away, never to see their families again,” Nickelodeon explained in the statement. “For the most part, kids were willing to take that risk in the hopes of completing the course and winning a Magnavox Portable Boombox or an all-expenses-paid trip to the Ramada South Ocean Beach Resort.” Huh. We always just assumed the guards would let the kids go when they got backstage, and the whole “capture” thing was totally fictional. This definitely casts the show in a different light.  Nickelodeon went on to say that during the show’s four-year run, approximately 85 children were claimed by the guards and never seen again, noting that “it is likely the guards either raised the kids as their own or disposed of them once they were no longer useful.” The network added that it bears no responsibility for whatever fate befell the children, as “the kids signed a form agreeing to it, and if they didn’t want to be taken from their families and possibly enslaved by scary Mayan guys, they should’ve read the fine print.”  Damn, that’s tough. While this is all clearly on the child contestants for foolishly agreeing to the show’s terms, it’s nonetheless a bit upsetting, and it definitely tarnishes some of the happy memories we have of watching “Legends Of The Hidden Temple.” Hopefully Nickelodeon isn’t pulling anything like this on their shows anymore, because it is not okay to abduct children, even if they perform poorly in Mayan-themed obstacle courses on national television."

As confirmed by neighbors of Ahmed’s family, Obama can be seen nearly every morning at sunrise sneaking up to the boy’s doorstep and leaving a fine hazelnut chocolate before scurrying off to hide behind a garbage can and watch his friend from a distance using opera glasses. Sources close to Obama say that as soon as his first meeting with Ahmed concluded in 2015, he was so elated that he immediately began working up a plan to see the child and his clock on a more regular basis, pacing frantically around the White House muttering “Gotta see that beautiful clock again…it is so neat…”. He then took to his computer to Google “most impressive candies” before placing a bulk order for 500,000 Ferrero Rocher chocolates using U.S. defense funds. Ever since, Obama has been covertly delivering chocolates to the boy on a daily basis—in fact, he is at this very moment waiting outside Ahmed’s house, watching him play Halo through his living room window and whispering “Show me the clock” over and over again! Obama has even continued dropping off the chocolates throughout the Covid-19 pandemic, thoughtfully wiping down each individual candy with Lysol for Ahmed’s safety and often leaving friendly notes with the chocolates that say things like “I hope you are staying safe during Covid—you are the best person I’ve ever met. Best, Obama.” While it seems that Obama has not yet realized that Ahmed’s parents typically just throw the chocolates in the trash every day, it’s doubtful that this would discourage him, as his love for Ahmed’s clock simply cannot be deterred. So lovely! It’s refreshing to see such a powerful world leader giving his time every day to serve the people. Here’s hoping he gets to see the clock again sometime soon!"
A New Start: Dustin Hoffman Has Announced That He Is Giving Up Acting To Chase The Mechanized Rabbit At A Dog Track,N/A,https://clickhole.com/a-new-start-dustin-hoffman-has-announced-that-he-is-giving-up-acting-to-chase-the-mechanized-rabbit-at-a-dog-track/,"Gossip rags and paparazzi are in a frenzy today following a bombshell announcement from one of Hollywood’s most esteemed A-listers: Dustin Hoffman has revealed that he is giving up acting to chase the mechanized rabbit at a dog track. Whoa! The silver screen will never be the same! In a press conference held outside his Malibu home earlier today, the Tootsie star revealed that he is ending his decades-long career in the entertainment industry to pursue his longtime dream of spending hours upon hours every day chasing the little rabbit thingie that leads dogs around the dog track. The announcement finally sheds light on why Hoffman has been frequently spotted breaking into dog tracks in recent years, officially putting to bed the rumors that he was doing so to prepare for a role in an upcoming Secretariat biopic.  “I must catch the rabbit,” said Hoffman when asked what motivated his sudden career shift. “The rabbit thinks it is faster than me. It taunts me on its stick. I hate the rabbit. But I must have the rabbit.” “I am going to catch the rabbit with my mouth and when I catch the rabbit then the rabbit will know that I am the one who is faster,” he added before fastening a dog muzzle over his mouth and galloping away on all fours while yelling “No one outruns the dad from Meet The Fockers! Suck my ass!” According to employees at Hoffman’s preferred dog track, the Oscar winner has been showing up at dawn each morning in a dog-racing vest, muttering about his desire to sink his teeth into “those sweet, succulent rabbit haunches”—demonstrating a deep commitment to his new craft but a fundamental misunderstanding of the edibility of mechanical objects. The employees noted that while Hoffman is still far slower than the slowest of dogs and is incapable of running a single lap without collapsing from heat stroke and requiring resuscitation, the 83-year-old is nonetheless steadily improving and feels confident that he’ll achieve his goal of catching the rabbit by his 110th birthday.   Inspiring! Go get it, Dustin! While we’ll definitely miss seeing him in movies, we’re happy that Hoffman is finally doing what he loves. Hope you get that rabbit, Dustin! We’re rooting for you!"
A Piece Of History: The Naginata That Lee Harvey Oswald Used To Cut Down JFK After Skillfully Deflecting A Mighty Blow From His Ōdachi Is Coming To The Smithsonian,N/A,https://clickhole.com/a-piece-of-history-the-naginata-that-lee-harvey-oswald-used-to-cut-down-jfk-after-skillfully-deflecting-a-mighty-blow-from-his-odachi-is-coming-to-the-smithsonian/,"The tragic events of November 22nd, 1963 forever altered the course of our nation’s history, and now a key artifact from that fateful day is being displayed to give modern Americans a window into their past: The naginata that Lee Harvey Oswald used to cut down JFK after skillfully deflecting a mighty blow from his ōdachi is coming to the Smithsonian. Wow. You’ve no doubt seen this naginata in history books, but now’s your chance to finally see it in person. The new exhibit, which opens in February, will give museumgoers a blow-by-blow account of the violent clash of steel and wills that took place on that remote Dallas roadway some 57 years ago. A series of placards by the entrance will describe the lead-up to the encounter for anyone unfamiliar: As JFK rode through Texas on a campaign to shore up support among powerful Southern families, his presidential caravan was halted by a rag-clad stranger named Lee Harvey Oswald who refused to move from the road when ordered. JFK’s trusted retainer John Connally requested the honor of striking down the impudent wanderer, but he had scarcely drawn his own uchigatana before Oswald disarmed and gravely wounded him with a masterful whirl of his naginata. It was only then that JFK heaved his towering ōdachi from its scabbard to challenge Oswald himself, and it’s here that the exhibit really opens up. A computer reconstruction of the battle will give visitors an up-close look at the ox-like strength with which JFK rained down heavy blows on his opponent, using multiple angles to highlight how Oswald’s more refined naginatajutsu allowed him to wear down JFK’s stamina by gracefully sidestepping and parrying the fearsome attacks like a cat toying with its prey. Narration provided by top JFK historians will explain how Oswald cleverly turned the blazing noonday sun to his advantage, reflecting its rays with deft positioning of his naginata’s mirror-polished blade to impair the 35th president’s vision and further provoke his frenzied rage. And while it will be preceded by a warning for graphic material, the reconstruction won’t shy away from showing the decisive moment when Oswald parried a reckless overhead swing of JFK’s ōdachi to throw him off balance and thrust his naginata into a small opening between the president’s kabuto and hon kozane dō, the fatal blow scattering JFK’s blood like rubies across the nearby susuki grass. The chance to see the gleaming blade and intricately carved shaft of the naginata that killed JFK will no doubt be the main draw of the exhibit, but the museum will also be displaying a handful of other iconic items from that tragic day, including the blood-stained pink yukata famously worn by Jackie Kennedy as LBJ was sworn in on Air Force One. A replica of JFK’s ōdachi will be included to give a sense of its behemoth 3.5 shaku size, though the original remains closely guarded by a sect of warrior monks at his final resting place in Arlington National Cemetery. The exhibit will also touch on the lingering questions left unanswered by official investigations into the encounter, such as how a commoner like Oswald came into possession of such a finely crafted weapon from the legendary Nishikiyama forge, and what JFK whispered after dropping to his knees and briefly raising a fallen paulownia blossom to his face before dying. Sadly, the answers to these mysteries likely vanished forever when nightclub owner Jack Ruby leapt down from a nearby rooftop as Oswald was being taken to county jail and swiftly dispatched him with a kusarigama, but the exhibit promises to nevertheless address them with a responsible and even-handed approach. Fascinating! It’s wonderful to see how the Smithsonian is repurposing this infamous naginata into a tool for historical education. This is one exhibit that American history buffs won’t want to miss when it opens to the public next month! "
The Legend Lives On: Prince’s Estate Has Released 6-Hours Of Outtake Recordings Of The Artist Trying To Verbally Convince A Pigeon Loose In The Studio To Kill Itself,N/A,https://clickhole.com/the-legend-lives-on-princes-estate-has-released-6-hours-of-outtake-recordings-of-the-artist-trying-to-verbally-convince-a-pigeon-loose-in-the-studio-to-kill-itself/,"With the passing of Prince, the music world suffered one of its biggest losses ever, and many of his fans are still coming to grips with his untimely death. Knowing that the legendary pop star will never lay down another track is crushing to his legions of fans, but fortunately there’s still a reason to party like it’s 1999: Prince’s estate just released 6 hours of outtakes of the artist doing his best to get a pigeon that flew into his studio to commit suicide. So much yes! Looks like Prince is treating us to more of his genius from beyond the grave. Throughout the brilliant, newly unearthed recording, a terrified Prince can be heard throwing instruments around and shouting, “Oh no! Kill yourself, bird! Shoo. Please please please make yourself dead!” while a bird squawks and flaps around. The release features no new Prince music, but die hard fans will get goosebumps the second they hear the artist shriek, “Hey bird! Go drown yourself in my toilet. Time to die, you goddamn fuckbird” over and over again for a full 360 minutes. The recording, titled “Hey! Kill Yourself, Fuckbird (Fuckbird Should Do Suicide)” was released exclusively on purple vinyl as a lavish 12-LP boxset in a velvet outer sleeve with a booklet including a full transcript of everything Prince says to the pigeon to persuade it to kill itself, an interview with the bird exterminator who tried and failed to capture the pigeon, and a series of blurry photos of what appears to be the bird in question. The first printing of 15,000 copies sold out immediately and copies are already selling on the secondary vendor site Discogs for over $1,000, but the entire session is also available to download off of iTunes for $60. The 6-hour session, from the time the bird flies into the studio while Prince was laying down the vocals to ‘Batdance’ until a studio intern finally crushes it with a broom, is being hailed by fans and critics alike as the greatest release of the year. A fan-made animated video using audio from the session of Prince shouting, “No bird gets to breathe my air! Go fly into a jet engine and end yourself, you bitch-ass bird bitch” while a pigeon pecks at Prince’s lunch has already amassed over 10 million views, so it’s clear that even in death, Price is still one of the world’s biggest stars. Wow! This release is proof that true music legends never die! Even in death Prince has managed to enchant the world with his art! Absolutely incredible! Who knows what other unreleased material of Prince encouraging animal suicide might be unearthed in Prince’s studio archives. If you’re a Prince fan you’ve gotta bump this recording immediately, as it’s the next best thing to a new album from the late superstar. Long live Prince! Share and comment if you’re as psyched as we are to listen to this brand new release from this musical genius!"
"Troubling Statistic: A Study Has Revealed 15,000 American Sex Ed Teachers Die Every Year By Accidentally Getting Their Head Stuck In A Condom And Suffocating While Trying To Teach Kids How To Put Them On A Banana",N/A,https://clickhole.com/troubling-statistic-a-study-has-revealed-15000-american-sex-ed-teachers-die-every-year-by-accidentally-getting-their-head-stuck-in-a-condom-and-suffocating-while-trying-to-teach-kids-how-to-put-them/,"A years-long research effort has just uncovered a disturbing truth about America’s education system that may be causing significant harm to our nation’s children: A new study has revealed that over 15,000 American sex education teachers die each year by accidentally getting their head stuck in a condom and suffocating while trying to teach kids how to put them on a banana. This is deeply troubling. American schools must do better! According to the study, which was conducted by public policy experts at Princeton University in conjunction with ProPublica, there are an alarming number of instances every single day in the U.S. where schoolchildren are stuck watching helplessly as their sex ed teacher flops around on the floor with a condom over their head and slowly asphyxiates. The study found that while typically the teachers just get their head stuck in the condom, they sometimes get their arms and legs caught in there as well. In fact, in nearly 20 percent of all condom-related sex ed deaths, the teachers somehow managed to get their entire body stuck inside the condom in the course of attempting to show their students how to slip the prophylactic over the tip of a banana. “While putting a condom on a banana remains an integral part of the American sex education curriculum, many of these lessons quickly devolve into a waking nightmare as the teacher accidentally traps themselves in a cocoon of latex and dies thrashing around on the floor in the most humiliating fashion possible,” said lead researcher Dr. Tatiana Cruz. “It is also incredibly traumatic for the students who are forced to watch their teachers suffocate inside a condom, especially since the responsibility often falls on them to drag the dead teacher’s body into the parking lot and cover it with leaves so that it doesn’t decompose in the classroom.” “As a consequence of all this, we have millions of students growing up without learning safe sexual practices, with many of them negatively associating the use of contraceptives with turning blue and suffocating to death—a dangerous mentality that leaves countless teenagers woefully underprepared to engage in responsible sexual activity,” she added.   The study also found that, prior to getting their heads stuck inside the condom, over 50 percent of sex ed teachers either say, “This is how you put a Fuck Hat on a long yellow fruit,” or “Pretend this delicious yellow tube is a human ding-dong. Now you must imprison it inside of a dangerous garbage bag called a ‘condom.’” The researchers have postulated that these types of statements are indicative of a widespread misunderstanding among sex education teachers of what condoms actually are and how they work, which may help explain why 15,000 of them end up suffocating inside one every single year. Absolutely chilling. Clearly, this study should serve as a major wakeup call that there needs to be serious change in our nation’s health classes. When taught in an effective and fact-based manner, sex ed has the potential to save lives of not only students, but also the educators tasked with teaching responsible sexual behaviors. It’s time for policymakers to take action and implement new protections to make sure that fewer sex ed teachers end up suffocating with their head stuck inside a condom!"
"Awesome: The Academy Has Announced That Since So Few Movies Were Released This Year, For The 2021 Oscars They’re Just Gonna Let Martin Short Do His Thing For 45 Minutes Then Give Best Picture To A Random Netflix Christmas Movie",N/A,https://clickhole.com/awesome-the-academy-has-announced-that-since-so-few-movies-were-released-this-year-for-the-2021-oscars-theyre-just-gonna-let-martin-short-do-his-thing-for-45-minutes-then-give-best-picture/,"With so few movies released in 2020 as a result of theater closures due to the Covid-19 pandemic, there’s been a lot of discussion about what might happen at the next Academy Awards ceremony. Fortunately, the Academy has just unveiled their exciting new solution: at the April 2021 Oscars, they’re just gonna let Martin Short do his thing for like 45 minutes then give Best Picture to one of those random Netflix Christmas movies.  Now this is how you turn lemons into lemonade! Kudos to the Academy for their excellent problem solving! In a press statement released earlier today, the Academy revealed their plan to cede the majority of the Oscars’ runtime to Martin Short so he can do whatever it is that he wants – be it interviewing celebrities in his fat suit as Jiminy Glick, doing whatever Ed Grimley’s thing is, or just shooting the shit with Steve Martin until he hits the 45 minute mark – before they’ll award Best Picture to some straight-to-Netflix Christmas movie like Holidate or The Princess Switch: Switched Again. “Between film festival cancellations and delayed releases, pretty much the only movies that came out this year were Tenet and all those Netflix Christmas ones that they started putting up in like September, so we’re just going to pick one of those for Best Picture and call it a day,” said the Academy. “The rest of the show will be Martin Short sort of prancing around, because that fills the time and will be fine.” Amazing! Congratulations in advance to some movie like The Christmas Chronicles 2 or Dolly Parton’s Christmas On The Square on winning Best Picture! The Academy went on to add that there will also be an In Memoriam segment at some point during the ceremony, but because the main people who died in 2020 were Alex Trebek and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, neither of whom were famous for movie stuff, they will just re-air last year’s In Memoriam reel, citing that “it’s not like those people aren’t still dead.” So cool! It’s great to see the Academy find ways to make the Oscars work during this unprecedented year. We can’t wait to watch the ceremony in April!"
Animal Welfare FTW: Red Lobster Will Now Send Each Lobster Down A Fun Curvy Water Slide Into A Pot Of Boiling Water,N/A,https://clickhole.com/animal-welfare-ftw-red-lobster-will-now-send-each-lobster-down-a-fun-curvy-water-slide-into-a-pot-of-boiling-water/,"If you’re an animal lover, get ready to cheer, because one of America’s most popular restaurant chains is taking a major stand for animal welfare: Red Lobster will now send each lobster down a fun, curvy water slide into a pot of boiling water. Awesome! It’s nice to see a massive corporate chain committing to doing what’s right.  Red Lobster announced the new initiative earlier this week, detailing plans to outfit each of their restaurant kitchens with incredibly fun four-foot-long plastic water slides full of thrilling twists and heart-stopping turns designed to give lobsters the time of their lives before they reach the bottom and plunge to their deaths in a pot of boiling water.  “Lobsters are highly intelligent and capable creatures, and we feel it is our responsibility to honor them with exhilarating water park-style fun before cooking them,” the company said in a press release. “Moving forward, every time you go to Red Lobster, you can take comfort knowing that each crustacean we serve spent its final moments happily zipping down a waterslide in a little pair of swim trunks, blissfully unaware of what awaits at the bottom.”  Red Lobster also revealed that customers who wish to commemorate the animal who died for their meal will now be able to purchase souvenir photos of their lobster tumbling down the slide. By seeing its many legs flailing and its eye stalks bobbing as it hurtles towards its death in boiling water, customers can better appreciate the animal’s sacrifice.  Wow! What an exciting moment for animal welfare! Major companies like Red Lobster often think more about their bottom line than ethics, so this is truly fantastic news for everyone who cares about how we treat the animals with whom we share the planet. Bravo, Red Lobster! Keep up the good work!"
Sad Day For Music: The Rope That Was Tied Around Ed Sheeran’s Waist Before He Entered The Fog Just Went Taut And Came Out Covered In Slime,N/A,https://clickhole.com/sad-day-for-music-the-rope-that-was-tied-around-ed-sheerans-waist-before-he-entered-the-fog-just-went-taut-and-came-out-covered-in-slime/,"The world became a colder, less joyful place today, because a tragic turn of events has robbed the music industry of one of its brightest young stars: The rope that was tied around Ed Sheeran’s waist before he entered the fog just went taut and came out covered in slime. It’s heartbreaking to see the fog take someone with such a promising future ahead of them. Ever since an explosion at a clandestine government laboratory opened a rift between our own reality and a bizarre, fog-shrouded hellscape, people all across the Eastern seaboard have been doing their best to survive the mysterious fog and the unthinkable terrors it conceals, and it seems that beloved songwriter Ed Sheeran has tragically lost that fight. While details are still emerging, it sounds as though Sheeran had attempted to venture out into the parking lot of the rural gas station where he and a handful of survivors had sought refuge from the otherworldly fog, likely to grab ammunition from the cruiser of the state trooper who was carried off by a large, bat-winged creature the previous night. Other survivors had volunteered for the risky job, but Sheeran selflessly argued that his prior experience with fog machines at his concerts made him the candidate most able to navigate through the fog. The attempt started off well, with Sheeran disappearing from view and giving a single tug on the line as a signal to let out more slack, but things rapidly went south after the Grammy-winner accidentally banged his acoustic guitar against a vehicle and set off its car alarm. Sheeran valiantly attempted to harmonize with the alarm in hopes of soothing any creatures disturbed by the noise, but his musical improvisation only made it easier for the unnatural beings to locate his exact position. Strange, trumpeting cries echoed forth from the fog as a powerful force suddenly pulled the line taut, and though the other survivors were eventually able to wrestle the rope back to the station, sadly all that remained in the loop at the end was a thick coating of pink, viscous slime. Damn. Twenty nine years is way too young to be pulled from your tether by an unseen, extra-dimensional entity. Some of the survivors have already proposed a recovery mission in the hopes that Sheeran might still be alive, but the guttural moans of a nearby leviathan have forced them to stay put in the gas station for now. Further complicating things is the fact that one of the gas station’s attendants has developed a chitinous exoskeleton on the parts of his hand that touched the slime as he was pulling in the rope, prompting a heated discussion over whether or not to amputate the arm that only wastes precious time and energy that could be spent consulting maps of the surrounding area for caves where a creature may have deposited the “Shape of You” singer for later use. It’s also hard to know what to make of the fact that a trilobite-like creature with uncanny human eyes—blue eyes like Sheeran’s—crawled up to the gas station shortly after the incident and mournfully clicked its mandibles to the rhythm of “Thinking Out Loud” at one of the survivors Sheeran had been closest with before skittering back into the fog. It’s possible from what we’ve seen of the slime’s effect on human flesh that the fog entities seem more interested in transforming Earth life than destroying it, but even if Sheeran’s consciousness persists in some form, the loss of his human arms and larynx still almost certainly means the end of his music career. Some in the music world have already offered their condolences on Twitter: This is just a crushing blow to all the fans who were excited to see where this talented young artist would take his craft next. We’ll always treasure the music he was able to share with us before his rope came back covered in slime, but it truly hurts to think of all the incredible albums he had yet to write that have vanished into the fog along with him. "
Animal Rights Win! The Iditarod Is Officially Replacing Sled Dogs With Crab-Walking Children,N/A,https://clickhole.com/animal-rights-win-the-iditarod-is-officially-replacing-sled-dogs-with-crab-walking-children/,"For years, the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race has been under fire for the animal cruelty that sled dogs suffer during both its training process and the race itself, but a new announcement proves that Alaska’s famous sled race has finally decided to listen to its critics: the Iditarod is officially replacing sled dogs with crab-walking children. Awesome! This is a landmark win for animal rights! Earlier today, the Iditarod Trail Committee announced that beginning in 2021, they’ll put a stop to the race’s pattern of dog abuse and neglect by replacing all sled dogs with crab-walking children who are roughly as tall as a husky. As animal rights activists have long pointed out, the windy, icy, and freezing conditions on the trail are incredibly dangerous, which is why it’s so heartwarming to see the Iditarod recognize that dogs deserve to live a painless and dignified life and start requiring a dozen kids aged 6 to 11 to pull each sled instead.  Although the race may now take slightly longer than the usual two weeks since a dozen kids crawling on their hands and feet through 1,000 miles of Alaskan wilderness can’t move as quickly as dogs, competitors and fans alike will be able to comfortably enjoy the race knowing that no animals are suffering during the event. But this new rule isn’t just great for animals – it’s great for the environment, too. By relying only on dog-sized children to pull the sleds, mushers will be able to repurpose their old dog collars and paw booties on the crab-walking kids, ensuring that this new change is also zero waste! Now this is how you treat animals – and the planet – with respect and dignity. In addition to the criticisms of the trail conditions and violence dogs faced from their mushers, the race has also been criticized for the fact the dogs were not even able to consent to the risky experience the way that people can. The Iditarod Trail Committee has clearly taken that critique to heart, since the new regulation will now require every child crab-walking in the race to dip their hand into paint and leave their handprint on a participation waiver before they can compete. Just amazing! After such a long record of sled dog mistreatment, it’s so inspiring to see the Iditarod do what’s right and retire their sled dogs for good. We can’t wait to see those sleds pulled by crab-walking kids this March!"
"Yikes, This One’s On Them: Thousands Of Endangered Turtles Have Been Found Dead After Auto-Erotically Asphyxiating On Plastic Six-Pack Rings",N/A,https://clickhole.com/yikes-this-ones-on-them-thousands-of-endangered-turtles-have-been-found-dead-after-auto-erotically-asphyxiating-on-plastic-six-pack-rings/,"Pollution in the world’s oceans has produced one of the greatest ecological crises the planet has ever experienced, and, troublingly, it now appears that things may only be getting worse: Thousands of endangered turtles have been found dead after auto-erotically asphyxiating on plastic six-pack rings. Yikes. While this is undeniably terrible, it is definitely a self-imposed tragedy on the turtles’ part. Earlier today, a team of marine biologists at Stanford University announced that they’d discovered a flotilla of approximately 4,000 dead, blissed-out green sea turtles with plastic six-pack rings around their necks decomposing in a lagoon off the U.S. Virgin Islands, indicating mass accidental death via reckless self-pleasuring. The researchers later confirmed this theory after spotting another pod of the turtles in a neighboring coral reef engaging in similar behavior, provocatively slapping their yellow-hued bellies with one fin while rapidly plunging their cloacas with the other, the plastic soda rings around their necks stifling their rapturous churrs and causing their eyes to bulge disturbingly from their skulls.  “While man-made pollution certainly poses a grave threat to marine animals, this alarming pattern of harmful sexual behavior involving six-pack rings we’re seeing among sea turtle populations suggests that they may very well be their own worst enemies,” said Dr. Richard Abdelati, the lead researcher on the project. “That said, rigor mortis preserved many of the turtles’ dying expressions, and nearly all of them were grinning in ecstasy. So seems like they at least went out doing what they loved.” “But to be clear, using litter to choke yourself while masturbating is a very bad idea, and if turtles keep it up, no amount of conservation efforts will be able to save them from extinction,” Dr. Abdelati added. “The turtles are clearly giving themselves incredible orgasms, but this behavior is definitely does not bode well for the survival of their species.” Worryingly, Abdelati says that there is also evidence that the turtles are fatally masturbating themselves in lieu of mating, noting that male turtles seem to be ignoring female turtles in favor of sticking their necks into plastic rings and pleasuring themselves. This suggests that not only are thousands of turtles dying from risky acts of onanism, but they’re also failing to reproduce, putting the long-term survival of their species in jeopardy. God, what a mess! These turtles really need to get their shit together. Unfortunately, as humans continue to dump over 15 trillion pieces of plastic into oceans each year, it is likely that turtles will keep finding newer and more dangerous ways to use pollution to get themselves off. We can only hope that the world’s sea turtles learn some self-control before its too late and all of them have died from auto-erotic asphyxiation. If they can’t figure out how to achieve a satisfying orgasm without choking themselves with garbage, their future looks grim indeed."
User Experience Win: Twitter Will Now Warn You When You Reach Enough Followers That A Bunch Of 50-Year-Old Male Comedians Will Start Responding To All Your Tweets,N/A,https://clickhole.com/user-experience-win-twitter-will-now-warn-you-when-you-reach-enough-followers-that-a-bunch-of-50-year-old-male-comedians-will-start-responding-to-all-your-tweets/,"If you’re a Twitter user, you’re in luck, because the social media platform just unveiled a new feature that is seriously giving their user experience a major boost: Twitter will now warn you when you reach enough followers that a bunch of 50-year-old male comedians will start responding to all your tweets. Incredible! Twitter is totally going above and beyond with this one. In a press statement released earlier today, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey explained that they rolled out this new feature to alert users to the phenomenon of middle-aged male comedians responding to all of your tweets like you’re old pals the moment you amass a decent amount of followers. Dorsey acknowledged that while it’s not a terrible experience, it can definitely come as a bit of a surprise, so it’s great to see that from here on out, whenever a user hits 10,000 followers, they’ll receive a notification saying, “Congrats on reaching 10K followers! FYI, a bunch of 50-year-old comedy guys who just sit online all day and reply to every tweet they see are going to start responding to yours now, too.” So cool! This is going to help so many people understand why comedy writers from the 90’s are suddenly replying to them! “The user experience is very important to us at Twitter, and we want to make sure that our users who gain over 10,000 followers aren’t caught off guard when their mentions are suddenly full of tweets from comedians whose bios list like 12 different TV shows from the past three decades,” explained Dorsey. “Whether you were already following these comedians because you’re a fan of a show they wrote on 15 years ago, or if you’ve straight up never heard of them before, we want you to know that these guys are going to be responding to all of your tweets with playful jokes, earnest advice, or, in the event of a particularly great tweet, just your name followed by a period.” The Twitter CEO went on to express regret over the fact that while it may seem like these comedians consider you a friend based on how frequently they talk to you on Twitter, it will never be clear exactly what your relationship to them really is. “Do they want to hang out? Do they want to hire you to help write on some new TV show they’re working on? Would they recognize you if they saw you in real life? Are they in love with you? We don’t know the answers to any of these questions, but we hope that giving you a heads up about this situation will give you adequate time to prepare,” concluded Dorsey. Awesome! This will totally provide users with some much-needed clarity when a guy whose big claim to fame is co-writing an episode of Seinfeld in the 90s or working as a script supervisor on Season 2 of Arrested Development starts replying to all of their tweets. Well done, Twitter! You hit this one out of the park!"
Catastrophic Dilemma: The Make-A-Wish Foundation Is In Crisis Mode After A Terminally Ill 12-Year-Old Demanded He Get A Blowjob From Mrs. Incredible,N/A,https://clickhole.com/catastrophic-dilemma-the-make-a-wish-foundation-is-in-crisis-mode-after-a-terminally-ill-12-year-old-demanded-he-get-a-blowjob-from-mrs-incredible/,"In its 40 years of operation, the Make-A-Wish Foundation has brought hope to hundreds of thousands of sick children by making their wishes come true. Tragically, however, the nonprofit now has a request on its hands that’s proving nearly impossible to fulfill: Make-A-Wish is in total crisis mode after a terminally ill 12-year-old demanded he get a blowjob from Mrs. Incredible.  Yikes. What a disaster. Since receiving the wish from a boy in Omaha, NE with terminal leukemia last week, the Make-A-Wish foundation has been in a state of total disarray as they try to figure out if it’s ethically acceptable for them to solicit a blowjob for a dying child, and if it is, how they’d possibly be able to get him one from a cartoon character. Although Make-A-Wish representatives have offered the boy several similar yet more doable wishes, like getting a hug from someone wearing a Mrs. Incredible costume, or doing a meet and greet with actress Holly Hunter who voices the character in the Pixar films, the boy has remained steadfast in his demand that he get a blowjob from “the real Mrs. Incredible.” He has also explicitly told Make-A-Wish officials that they can’t try to trick him on this, because he will “totally be able to tell if it’s not really her.” While the Make-A-Wish Foundation historically does everything they can to grant a child’s wish, their staff is reportedly split regarding the decision to grant this boy’s request. On the one hand, it would be incredibly cruel to deny a dying child’s final wish, but on the other, not only are there glaring legal implications associated with granting a 12-year-old’s wish for a blowjob, the technology to allow someone to receive a blowjob from a cartoon character likely does not exist. However, nobody, not even the staff members who are adamant that his request be denied, wants to tell the boy that he won’t be getting his dying wish. The only time the boy has smiled in weeks was when he told his doctor about how wonderful it will be to “get sucked off just once by the real Mrs. Incredible,” and nobody wants to be the one to break his heart by telling him that this might not happen.  Wow. This request is causing a major disruption to the non-profit, as dozens of employees have already resigned over this complicated decision. Here’s hoping that Make-A-Wish figures out how to handle this soon, because until it does, things are going to remain a total frenzy."

Comics Fans Rejoice! Marvel Has Announced That From Now On Spider-Man’s Main Job Is Delivering Wine To Underage Kids,N/A,https://clickhole.com/comics-fans-rejoice-marvel-has-announced-that-from-now-on-spider-mans-main-job-is-delivering-wine-to-underage-kids/,"Get excited, comic book fans, because one of the most iconic superheroes of all time is getting reimagined in a seriously awesome way: Marvel has announced that from now on Spider-Man’s main job is delivering wine to underage kids! Awesome! Looks like everyone’s favorite web slinger has been officially updated for the 21st century. Marvel tweeted out a statement this morning detailing all the ways in which fans can expect Spider-Man to change now that his principal responsibility is to give wine to children. The company explained that the change was designed to “bring Spider-Man to a whole new generation of fans” and to prove that “Spider-Man is good at giving wine to kids.” Marvel went on to reveal that Spider-Man will no longer be battling supervillains or joining forces with the rest of the Avengers and will instead be spending most of his time tending to an email address he set up called “[email protected].” When a child under the legal drinking age wants wine, they can send an email to that address that says, “Bring me wine, Spider-Man” along with their current location. When Spider-Man receives that email, he’ll grab several bottles of wine, tuck them into his waistband, and go swinging through the New York City skyline to deliver the wine to the kid as fast as he possibly can. If you can’t wait to see this bold new Spider-Man in action, you’re in luck! Marvel also tweeted out a sneak peek of the next issue of The Amazing Spider-Man due out next month. In the preview, Spider-Man is seen frantically whizzing through New York City to bring an eight-year-old boy a bottle of merlot when he suddenly sees Mysterio attacking a large group of people on the street below. When a woman calls out, “Save us, Spider-Man!” Spider-Man replies, “I cannot help you right now. There is a child out there who needs wine,” before zipping up the side of a building and leaving them to get murdered by Mysterio. Marvel also teased a scene where Spider-Man crashes through the window of a middle school math class, his arms filled with wine. The kids cheer as Spider-Man webs the teacher to the wall and gives each student their own bottle of wine. Spider-Man then says, “There are currently seven violent crimes happening within 20 square blocks of here and I will be ignoring them all,” before hopping out the window and swinging off to Sam’s Club to buy more wine. So cool! We can’t wait to see more! This is seriously so exciting. It’s always cool when Marvel takes their most iconic franchises in daring new directions. Let us know in the comments if you’re as stoked as we are to see Spider-Man’s new adventures in bringing wine to children!"
An Exciting New Era For ‘Jeopardy!’: A Mustachioed Baby Boy From A Tribe Of Nomads In Inner Mongolia Has Been Named As The Successor To Alex Trebek,N/A,https://clickhole.com/an-exciting-new-era-for-jeopardy-a-mustachioed-baby-boy-from-a-tribe-of-nomads-in-inner-mongolia-has-been-named-as-the-successor-to-alex-trebek/,"Since the tragic passing of Alex Trebek earlier this month, Jeopardy! fans have been anxiously waiting for any news on what the show’s future might hold and who might take over as host, and it looks like there are now finally some answers: a mustachioed baby boy from a tribe of nomads in Inner Mongolia has officially been named as the successor to Alex Trebek! Wonderful news! Er, or perhaps should we say, “What is wonderful news”!  The quiz show confirmed in a press release earlier today that Trebek will officially be succeeded by a 15-month-old Inner Mongolian child named Temujin, who is said to embody all of the necessary hosting traits that the ancient prophets foretold. A roaming tribe of Jeopardy! producers discovered Temujin only after vetting hundreds of other children in sub-Saharan Africa and the South Pacific without luck, noting that the boy was the only child they encountered with a full-grown adult mustache. The boy was also the only child who was able to successfully identify the hidden Daily Double on the centuries-old stone game board that is traditionally used to select new hosts. The child then proved that this wasn’t just a lucky guess by correctly selecting Trebek’s signature pair of rimless spectacles from a lineup of glasses, making it clear beyond a shadow of doubt that he is indeed the Chosen One.  Though still but an infant, Jeopardy! producers say that Temujin possesses a trivia show-hosting acumen well beyond his years, navigating conversation with the practiced efficiency of someone alway prepared to cut to commercial break while humoring his visitors’ anecdotes of their long journey with a lukewarm “Good for you!”—a distinctly Trebekian response that leaves one with no doubt that the boy is truly the iconic host’s reincarnation. This assessment was only further confirmed when, upon donning the late Trebek’s spectacles, Temujin let out a beautiful wail bearing the distinct melody of the Final Jeopardy! theme song, just as was foretold throughout the ages. It was at this point that the producers signed Temujin to a lifelong contract and whisked him off to Hollywood to prepare him for his destiny.    Extraordinary! We cannot wait to see this new era of Jeopardy! unfold with Temujin at the helm. He is clearly the rightful successor to the Jeopardy! legacy, and being possessed with Trebek’s spirit, there’s no doubt that he will be loved and adored by viewers for many years to come. "
A Weak Man: This Guy Has A Bad Habit You Kicked Two Months Ago,N/A,https://clickhole.com/a-weak-man-this-guy-has-a-bad-habit-you-kicked-two-months-ago/,"As human beings, we have the power to control our own destinies, and through constant hard work and dedication, we’re all capable of becoming the best versions of ourselves. The thing is, though, that you have to want it, and sadly some people just don’t seem to have the strength and willpower it takes to hack it in this world. Case in point: this man has a bad habit that you kicked two months ago.   God, what a shame. He really needs to get his shit together.  The man in question—a weak-willed coworker of yours named Mark—has for years been utterly powerless to soda, struggling with an unhealthy six-can-a-day habit not unlike the one you conquered earlier this year. Sadly, though, it seems that Mark does not possess the same type of self-motivation and mental resilience that you relied on to cut soda out of your life, which is a shame, because if he knew how energized and focused you’ve felt these past eight glorious weeks without all those artificial sweeteners and chemicals dragging you down, he might realize just how harmful and sad his lifestyle truly is.  God, it’s honestly pathetic how utterly impotent he is in the face of his addiction, helplessly gulping down can after can of sugary poison every single day just like you once did before becoming enlightened to the far more sensible ways of flavored seltzer. Sure, making such a change is easier said than done—who can forget the several days of mild headaches you suffered through in order to better yourself?—but if Mark could just muster the strength to say “No!” to his carbonated master and power through a brief period of soda withdrawals, he could enjoy all the wonderful benefits that you’ve enjoyed these past eight weeks, such as losing five pounds without even having to exercise. But tragically, one fears that he is simply too weak. It’s survival of the fittest, and, pitifully, it appears Mark is simply outmatched and overpowered by these inanimate aluminum cylinders of brown liquid that you so handily vanquished in a past season of your life.  God, where is Mark’s courage? Where is the will to survive? If only you could get through to him somehow. If only you could make him realize that his habit is putting him at a heightened risk of Type 2 diabetes and heart disease, whereas people who are strong enough to quit drinking soda—you, for example—are healthy and energized, laughing heartily in the faces of diabetes and other diseases of vice. Though you are now a much more determined and mature individual than Mark, you can remember a time many weeks ago when you weren’t all that different from him, and if he too remembers this, then perhaps he will realize he still has hope. Not much, but there’s a sliver. But at the end of the day, it’s up to him to make the choice to kick his soda habit, and while it won’t be easy for someone as weak-willed as him, hopefully you can continue to stand as an example to him of what it looks like to be a healthy, capable human being."
Come Back Tomorrow: The Main Thing On The Internet Today Is Some Massive Argument Involving A Half-Fox Character From A D&D Podcast,N/A,https://clickhole.com/come-back-tomorrow-the-main-thing-on-the-internet-today-is-some-massive-argument-involving-a-half-fox-character-from-a-dd-podcast/,"Don’t get too excited to spend another incredible day online, because once you hear what everyone’s talking about right now, you might choose to come back tomorrow instead: The main thing on the internet today is some massive argument involving a half-fox character from a D&D podcast.  Just log off now. The amount of effort you’re gonna have to put in to figure out what everyone’s talking about is simply not worth it.  The gist of the argument seems to be that some Dungeons & Dragons podcast ripped off the idea of a “half-fox warlock whose parents died in a goblin raid” from another Dungeons & Dragons podcast, and the fan bases of both of these podcasts are fighting because they both think their favorite podcast is in the right. Obviously if you listened to one of the podcasts you’d probably give a shit and start going off in the replies, but for those who are coming in cold, the whole thing is pretty low-stakes and boring, and spending hours digging through Reddit to piece it all together is not going to be worth it. Seriously, you’re not missing anything if you just sit this one out. The New Yorker released some long read about climate change that they definitely thought would be the big conversation piece, but everyone’s completely ignored it in favor of this D&D thing.  Apparently it all started with a big Twitter thread from the host of one of the D&D podcasts, and the tweets are so viral that they’re gonna appear on your timeline even if you don’t follow any of the people involved. All of the fans started changing their Twitter icons to illustrations of the half-fox they believe to be the original half-fox, and “#MyHalfFox” started trending, but then an old tweet was dug up from one of the hosts where he calls elves “knife-ears,” which is apparently a slur in D&D (though literally no one outside of the D&D world would know that), and even Chrissy Teigen weighed in and said that he should be canceled. Also, someone posted a separate but related thread about how it’s okay to find half-foxes attractive, but you just shouldn’t act on it, and now there’s a whole discussion going on about consensual beastiality. Honestly, it’s just not worth trying to parse out what’s going on here. Nothing wrong with taking a day off from the internet every once in a while. Of course, there’s probably an explainer you could read on some website called, like, “Geekopedia,” in order get up to speed so you can retweet something, but what’s the point? This will all be over by the end of the day, and tomorrow everyone will be talking about something that either requires way less context or is actually interesting. Maybe a B-list celebrity will get body shamed or some senator will be outed as a sex pest. Fingers crossed!"
"Fed Up: The CIA Is Tweeting That If Your Terrorism Includes Computers And Emails, How’s About You Drop The Pussy Shit And Fly A Plane At Us Like A Man",N/A,https://clickhole.com/fed-up-the-cia-is-tweeting-that-if-your-terrorism-includes-computers-and-emails-hows-about-you-drop-the-pussy-shit-and-fly-a-plane-at-us-like-a-man/,"Over the past couple of decades, virtually every aspect of our everyday lives has been transformed by technology, including how people go about committing crimes. Yet not all of the change has been welcome, and now the world’s most sophisticated defense organizations is aiming to take things back to how they once were: The CIA just took to Twitter to urge terrorists who commit terror using computers to “drop the pussy shit and fly a plane at us like a man.” Damn. Sounds like the CIA is getting pretty fed up! The intelligence agency took to its official Twitter account earlier today to lament the impact of technology on terrorism in recent decades, calling on the world’s criminal masterminds to log off the internet and go back to the days of committing extreme violence in person:      Wow. Seems like the CIA is really jonesin’ for a good ol’ fashioned scrap! Whether terrorists around the world will heed the CIA’s call is yet to be seen, but whatever happens, it’s reassuring to know that those entrusted with defending our nation are ready and eager to confront whatever threats might come our way."
Elegance Incarnate: This 8th Grader Has Taken A Series Of Incredibly Refined Photos Of Herself Doing An Arabesque In Pointe Shoes In Front Of The Cold Stone Downtown,N/A,https://clickhole.com/elegance-incarnate-this-8th-grader-has-taken-a-series-of-incredibly-refined-photos-of-herself-doing-an-arabesque-in-pointe-shoes-in-front-of-the-cold-stone-downtown/,"Get ready to be wowed, because here’s a story about a young lady who embodies elegance in a way the world hasn’t seen since Audrey Hepburn: this 8th grader has taken a series of incredibly refined photos of herself doing an arabesque in pointe shoes in front of the Cold Stone downtown! Breathtaking!  Earlier this week, 13-year-old Emma Billings of Norfolk, Virginia, used her mother’s iPhone to capture a series of arresting images of herself next to a fountain in a gorgeous cobblestoned shopping plaza, which depict her striking a series of dance poses from her Pointe II class that evoke such grace and poise that you’d think she was a Bolshoi soloist. Emma had the idea for the shoot when she and three ballet friends decided to go to Cold Stone for some Birthday Cake Remix, and she quickly grabbed her dance bag and donned her best leotard so that upon arrival she and her friend Mackenzie could to hop out of her mom’s minivan and stage the glamorous photoshoot. So focused was Emma on her artistic project that she barely noticed the group of preteen boys in neon Under Armour hoodies cruising by on RipStiks or the middle-aged moms by the Noodles & Company who were watching her with confused expressions, likely baffled as to how a mere child could possess so much sophistication. Instead, she proudly displayed Margot Fonteyn-like gifts of artistry as she clattered around on the stone ground in her brand-new pink satin Capezios, making dramatic leaps in the air before rushing over to Mackenzie to flip through the resulting images and delete the ones where her face looked “fucked up.” In addition to her talent for ballet, Emma must be a prodigious art director, because the contrast between her still, focused arabesque and the surrounding hustle and bustle of customers from the nearby Ulta create a stark contrast that serves to highlight the seriousness of Emma’s involvement in the Youth Ballet Program at Norfolk Academy Of Dance. Before posting her photos in a carousel to instagram, Emma took care to edit the images to be as striking as possible, adding a sepia filter to some images for a vintage touch while enhancing others with thought-provoking captions such as “Dance” and “Emma Rose Billings <3 2020 <3”. The photos somehow manage to even eclipse the ones from her shoot earlier this year, when she captured a number of dazzling images of herself and several friends wearing American Eagle bikinis and doing graceful grand jetes by the boardwalk at Virginia Beach. These new photos in front of Cold Stone have already garnered positive comments like “YES emma!!!!” and “omggg how are u so flexible,” suggesting that these may very well be the most elegant images the world has ever known. All we can say is wow. These photos are simply the epitome of beauty and grace, and we will definitely be looking back on them whenever we need to be inspired! Truly, this is the finest art that the sidewalk in front of Cold Stone has ever produced. Brava, young lady! Brava!"
Incredible: MIT Scientists Are 99% Sure That Dude Is David Duchovny,N/A,https://clickhole.com/incredible-mit-scientists-are-99-sure-that-dude-is-david-duchovny/,"A team of researchers just compiled some groundbreaking evidence that the guy seated not too far from them is actually someone super famous and not just some average Joe: scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology are 99 percent sure that dude is David Duchovny.  Just amazing! It’s incredible what kinds of discoveries science can make! Following an exhaustive ten minute study, the researchers have determined that the man sitting right over there in the airport terminal has totally got to be X-Files star David Duchovny, noting how he looks pretty much exactly the way he does on TV, barring some bags around his eyes and some slight facial hair, which makes sense after factoring in how he definitely has professionals do his hair and makeup when he’s on set. Although there is a one percent margin of error due to the fact that the scientists are in Boston and not, like, Los Angeles where David Duchovny probably lives, the way in which he is just sitting inconspicuously with headphones on further supports their hypothesis since a big star like him would most likely just want to get on his flight without having anyone come up to him and ask for an autograph.  “To test our theory that this was, in fact, David Duchovny, I pretended to take a selfie with my phone’s front-facing camera, but I was really using the rear-facing camera to snap a picture of the guy, which I then sent to my friend who is super obsessed with Californication,” explained the study’s lead researcher, Dr. Angel Malmrose. “To maintain objectivity, I didn’t say who I believed was in the picture – I just sent it off with no caption. Fortunately, my friend’s immediate reply of ‘david duchovny!!!! awesome’ is strong evidence in support of our hypothesis that the guy is definitely who we think it is.” Although all of their initial results were promising, the team still had to verify their theory with the use of a control group. In their next trial, one researcher discretely whisper-shouted “David Duchovny!” within 10 feet of the man they believed to be David, as well as within 10 feet of a random, other man in the airport dubbed the “placebo David.” When only the man they suspected to be David Duchovny turned his head in response to hearing the name, it provided even more evidence that the research team’s theory was sound. While the scientists say that the only way to be 100 percent sure that this guy is David Duchovny would be to just go over there and ask him point-blank who he is, they admit that it would be an infringement on his privacy. However, they say that they might work up the courage to say something if he ends up being on their flight, and especially if he’s in their same row.  Just fascinating! This has to be the biggest scientific breakthrough since a team at UCLA determined with 85.3% certainty that they saw Leonardo DiCaprio in an In-N-Out. Congrats to the MIT researchers on their amazing discovery. Science FTW!"
Compassionate But Safe: Revlon Has Announced They’ve Stopped Testing On Animals But Are Including A Rat With Every Tube Of Lipstick In Case You Want To Test It Yourself,N/A,https://clickhole.com/compassionate-but-safe-revlon-has-announced-theyve-stopped-testing-on-animals-but-are-including-a-rat-with-every-tube-of-lipstick-in-case-you-want-to-test-it-yourself/,"Animal testing has long been a controversial topic with no easy answers. While animal welfare advocates deem it an unnecessary cruelty, it remains a highly effective method for determining the safety of products. It’s a polarizing debate, but now one cosmetics company is empowering consumers to make their own choice on the matter according to their own beliefs: Revlon has announced that they are discontinuing animal testing but will now be including a rat with each tube of lipstick in case you want to do it yourself.  Awesome! Finally, a way to make everyone happy. Revlon announced the news in a press release earlier this week, explaining that all of their lip products will now come packaged with a live lab rat and a small set of surgical instruments so that consumers can perform experiments on the animal if they’d like to make their own determination as to whether or not the product is safe for human use. This way, individuals who need to inflict suffering and death on innocent creatures to feel safe can do so, while those who are opposed to animal testing can simply free the rats in their backyards and use the products as usual.  Revlon has started promoting the rat-inclusive packaging with the tagline, “We don’t test on animals, but you can,” neutrally positioning themselves in a way that appeals to animal rights advocates while not casting judgement on those who choose to pin down rodents and rub lipstick all over them so they can have some peace of mind. The marketing is also inviting to morally ambiguous individuals who would largely prefer not to harm animals but occasionally would like to test out a lip shade on a rat first to make sure it looks good before putting it on themselves. What an amazing innovation! Whoever came up with the idea of packaging a lab rat with lipstick and leaving the testing up to the customer deserves a massive raise, because this is a brilliant yet simple solution to an impossibly complex issue. Whether you’re someone who tries to lead a do-no-harm lifestyle or someone who sometimes feels the need to expose rats to unfamiliar chemicals to make sure you don’t get a rash or whatever, Revlon has the perfect line of products for you. It’s great knowing that you don’t have to be cruel—although totally cool if you want to!—in order to feel beautiful."
Who Gives A Shit: NASA Says It Has A Huge Announcement To Make About Neptune,N/A,https://clickhole.com/who-gives-a-shit-nasa-says-it-has-a-huge-announcement-to-make-about-neptune/,"Well, file this one under “POINTLESS WASTE OF TIME,” because here’s a story that could not possibly matter less: NASA says it has a huge announcement to make about Neptune. Oh, really? Neptune? Wow, no one gives a shit!  Earlier today, NASA went on social media to tease a forthcoming announcement that will apparently “change everything you thought you knew about Neptune,” as if Neptune was a thing people actually cared about and not just some bullshit planet most people haven’t thought about since learning about the solar system in second grade. The space agency framed the news as if it’s something truly momentous, seemingly under the baffling impression that new facts about irrelevant planets could somehow affect people’s everyday lives in any possible way, even though literally no one who is normal has actually cared about space since the moon race in the ‘60s. Seriously, no matter what the announcement is, it just cannot possibly matter. Like, if they say there’s water on Neptune, who gives a shit? Our fucking toilets have water in them, too, but you don’t see us making announcements about it. Or maybe they’ll tell us they found some microscopic organisms or something, but again, who gives a shit? Unless it’s real-ass aliens you can see without a microscope, it just literally does not matter to the American people. We do not know or care what Neptune looks like or if it is made of gas or anything like that because it is not a consequential planet. We only care about Earth, Mars, the moon, the sun, and sometimes Saturn due to the fact that it has rings. Everything else in space is just Star Trek bullshit.   Listen, NASA, how about you just let us know if there’s a deadly asteroid flying towards us, but then otherwise shut the fuck up. You are nerds, and almost nothing you do or find is interesting to us. Like, if we don’t give a shit about the rocks five feet away from us on the ground, then why the hell would we care about rocks that are a billion lightyears away or whatever? Outer space is very dumb. Borderline embarrassing, honestly.  Anyway, fuck off to Neptune. And fuck off to NASA, too. Don’t talk to us again until you’ve got legit-ass aliens to show us, because we simply do not have time for your bullshit."
Mental Health Win! There Is A Clown Falling From The Sky!,N/A,https://clickhole.com/mental-health-win-there-is-a-clown-falling-from-the-sky/,"In these historically stressful times, taking care of your mental health is more important than ever. But thankfully, during this uniquely stressful election week, you can give yourself a major serotonin boost simply by walking outside and looking up at the clouds, as there is currently a clown falling from the sky! Fantastic! This is exactly what our anxious nation needs right now. Indeed, if you step out into your yard right now and gaze upwards, chances are you’ll see a clown plummeting towards the ground like a meteor of pure laughter, his painted face contorted into a fun-loving scream and his colorful jumpsuit billowing in the wind. What a treat it is to see this merry buffoon thrashing wildly in the thin air and amusing us with his wacky foolery, making us smile despite being mere moments away from a fatal splat on the rocky earth below. Such a cut-up!  If you’re feeling overwhelmed by election anxiety, give yourself a nice, calming brain break and look up at the clown, who is now delighting us with even more silly antics, screaming and flapping his arms frantically like a bird even though he surely knows he cannot fly! It is impossible to feel anything but sheer, unbridled happiness as you watch this goofy red-nosed clown desperately yanking bright handkerchiefs out of his sleeve in futile hope of finding something that can save him. Try not to giggle as he pitifully attempts to use his baggy trouser legs as parachutes to slow his fall, causing his costume to inflate to comically round proportions so that his appearance is like that of an obese jester from the heavens! How absurd it is to see all the confetti and rubber chickens and other humorous clown jetsam flying off of his person as he continues to scream towards the unforgiving ground below at an unsurvivable velocity. Just wonderful! It should be noted at this point that it is still unclear who the clown is or how he got into the sky. All we know is that he DID NOT jump out of an airplane, as confirmed by a preliminary FAA investigation. But perhaps it is better to not know. Perhaps an unexplained clown whimsically falling from space is just what our collective mental health needs right now—joyous chaos to offset the chaos of the pandemic and the election. All we know is that he fills our hearts with joy, and we can probably also safely assume that his body will produce a funny honking sound upon impact.  Little moments of everyday magic like these can go a long way towards keeping us sane! There’s no telling quite how much time is left before the clown hits the ground, but it’s probably only a minute or two, so if you’re worried about your emotional well-being, you should get out and look at the falling clown sooner rather than later. Once you see him, you will be grinning from ear to ear! Kudos to this mysterious clown for falling from the sky and making us all feel better—it’s just what we needed to get us through these difficult times."
"It’s Noon On Election Day, And You Know What That Means: Time To Send The VP Candidates To Bed!",N/A,https://clickhole.com/its-noon-on-election-day-and-you-know-what-that-means-time-to-send-the-vp-candidates-to-bed/,"Well, folks, the clock just struck noon on Election Day, and that can only mean one thing: it’s time to send the VP candidates to bed! Goodnight, Mike Pence! Goodnight, Kamala Harris! Only one more sleep until you find out who the next VP will be! As per tradition, Pence and Harris will momentarily be escorted to their respective bedrooms by a corps of West Point cadets, who will then sing a series of patriotic hymns to lull the candidates into a deep sleep. A spokesman for Harris has confirmed that the senator has chosen a XXL airbrushed T-shirt with the word “CANCUN” on it as her official Election Day pajamas, while reps for Pence say the incumbent VP will be donning a full suit and tie in bed just like he always does. Before heading to bed, both VP candidates are expected to participate in the customary Brushing Of The Teeth, with each set to scrub their pearly whites with the same storied oak-and-horse-hair toothbrushes that their parties’ VP candidates have used for centuries yet never rinsed off as a matter of superstition. Then, once they’ve brushed their teeth and curled up under their sheets, the candidates will each be treated to exactly one bedtime story of their choice. The Harris campaign has confirmed that she has chosen a chapter from Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, while Pence has reportedly requested to hear the recounting of Amoz’s lineage from the book of Isaiah, an old childhood favorite. Following the bedtime stories, the presidential candidates will then arrive at the VP candidates’ bedrooms to kiss them goodnight before returning to the day’s campaign events. The VP candidates will then fall asleep and will remain sleeping until the election results are in, at which point they will be awakened by a series of five gunshots and then alerted to the election results via breakfast, with the winner being served a plate of delicious fried ham with a large glass of Alka Seltzer and the loser being served a pile of dead pigeons with a large glass of Alka Seltzer. The winning candidate will then eat their meal before heading out to celebrate with their running mate, while the losing candidate will be taken to Arlington National Cemetery and buried alive. The custom of making the VP candidates go to sleep at noon on Election Day originated in 1778, when George Washington noticed that his running mate was “so taken by the day’s excitements” that his “manhood stirred visibly with excessive activity of blood and nerve, spurring him to partake in vigorous acts of self-abuse against his own groin before a large gathering of aghast political patrons,” an act that embarrassed Washington so greatly that he ordered Adams to “retire to his bedchamber at the luncheon hour so that he could proceed with his troubled amusements privately, a command with which Adams eagerly complied, attending to the hiss and clang of his privates with such unhindered energy that he swiftly tuckered and fell into a slumber.” The tradition has continued faithfully ever since, although it nearly came to an end in 2016 when Donald Trump seemed unaware of his duty to uphold the custom, yet luckily he ended up sending Pence to bed at noon anyway for completely unrelated reasons. Fascinating! This tradition is definitely one of the most fun parts of Election Day, and here’s hoping that this year’s VP candidates are able to fall asleep quickly so that they can find out who won the election as soon as possible. Sweet dreams, Mike and Kamala! "
Spookiness Takes Its Toll: The Stress Of Halloween Has Once Again Caused Breakup And Divorce Rates Across The Country To Skyrocket,N/A,https://clickhole.com/spookiness-takes-its-toll-the-stress-of-halloween-has-once-again-caused-breakup-and-divorce-rates-across-the-country-to-skyrocket/,"If you’re in a relationship, you might want to stay on your toes right now, because an unfortunate yearly phenomenon is spelling disaster for couples all around the U.S.: the stress of Halloween has once again caused breakup and divorce rates across the country to skyrocket. So sad. Every year, the spookiness of this holiday gets the best of some of the most loving couples nationwide. As much fun as Halloween can be, the holiday does not come without devastating consequences for romantic relationships — unfortunately, marriages and partnerships are prone to fraying under the stress caused by the spine-chillingly spooky ambiance that is all but inescapable in the month leading up to “fright night.” This year, the statistics are as grim as ever: divorces and breakups have increased sharply as the Halloween season has approached, with many couples citing an overwhelming sense of the “heebie jeebies” as one reason for their split. “Oftentimes, people take out their stress on their partners during the Halloween season, snapping at them after a tense walk home past a particularly ghoulish jack-o-lantern, or blaming them for failing to protect the family from a mummy who jumped out at them during a haunted hayride ,” said relationship therapist Hannah Markweiler. “For others, Halloween means undue pressure to have the eeriest fright-fest of their lives on October 31st, a ridiculously high standard that can threaten the health of even the longest marriage. It might sound extreme, but I’ve seen couples part ways over something as simple as one partner purchasing a decorative tombstone reading ‘Boo!’ rather than the much scarier ‘Rest In Pieces.’” Just heartbreaking. Our thoughts are with anyone who is going through a painful split during this creepy crawly time of year. There are other dimensions to the pressure-cooker that is Halloween which can affect relationships, too, such as the blow-out fights that can ensue as couples engage in a power struggle over which person should be Austin Powers and which should be Dr. Evil as part of their couples costume. Furthermore, tensions at home can rise as one or both partners find themselves feeling unsafe in their own home due to their child’s terrifying werewolf costume. In fact, some couples find that the shock and horror they feel after seeing a person dressed as Jason Vorhees or a human-sized black widow spider can cause them to reflect on their mortality, thus rethinking their life choices and putting their relationship in jeopardy. “Sometimes, all it takes is the simple thought of being visited in their home by a woman in a blood-stained nurse outfit carrying a hatchet to make a person realize that life is short, and their marriage is not working for them,” Markweiler explained. “Halloween brings up so many emotions: fear of ghosts, fear of goblins, fear of ghouls, and more. No one wants to go through a breakup during such a highly anticipated holiday, but it’s the sad reality for many couples.” Wow. It’s so tragic to see so many couples struggling right now, but that’s just the way it goes on Halloween. If you’re currently in a relationship, you might want to see to it that you keep your connection strong. Remember to stay brave no matter how scary people’s costumes are or how eerie your neighbor’s porch decorations are, and you and your partner should be able to stay together even during this spooktacular frightfest."
No Way He’s Bouncing Back From This One: A Shocking Tape Has Surfaced Where President Trump Appears To Be Bragging About Groping Women To Billy Bush,N/A,https://clickhole.com/no-way-hes-bouncing-back-from-this-one-a-shocking-tape-has-surfaced-where-president-trump-appears-to-be-bragging-about-groping-women-to-billy-bush/,"Over the past few years, President Donald Trump has been able to emerge unscathed from countless damning scandals that would’ve ended the careers of pretty much any other elected official. But now, with the election just days away, it looks like he’s finally been caught in an act so heinous and morally reprehensible that not even his most loyal supporters will be able to stomach it: A disturbing tape has surfaced of President Trump bragging about sexually assaulting women to Billy Bush. Absolutely disgusting. There’s simply no way that Trump can bounce back from this one. The shocking recording, which, according to the tipster who sent it to us, was taken in 2005 while Trump was mic’d up for a television appearance, captures the president lewdly detailing his attempt to seduce Access Hollywood host Nancy O’Dell to her co-host Billy Bush: “I moved on her, and I failed. I’ll admit it. I did try and fuck her. She was married. And I moved on her very heavily. In fact, I took her out furniture shopping. She wanted to get some furniture. I said, ‘I’ll show you where they have some nice furniture.’ I took her out furniture—I moved on her like a bitch. But I couldn’t get there. And she was married. Then all of a sudden I see her, she’s now got the big phony tits and everything. She’s totally changed her look.” Yikes! That quote alone would likely be enough to sink his political career, yet, incredibly, Trump somehow manages to get even more crass as the conversation continues. While discussing actress Arianne Zucker, whom he and Bush were waiting to meet, Trump says one of the most disturbing things you’ll ever hear:  “I better use some Tic Tacs just in case I start kissing her. You know I’m automatically attracted to beautiful—I just start kissing them. It’s like a magnet. Just kiss. I don’t even wait. And when you’re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything. Grab ’em by the pussy. You can do anything.” Yep, that’s right. This is a real quote from the current president of the United States of America where he is gleefully boasting about his strategy for using his fame to sexually overpower non-consenting women. It is beyond unconscionable, yet as appalling and shameful as it might be, some comfort can be taken in the fact that we live in a proud and principled democracy with plenty of checks and balances in place to make sure that vile, overt predators like President Trump are removed from power before they can do too much damage to our great nation. And considering the profound damage that America and its reputation would suffer under the continued leadership of an avowed sex offender, Republicans will unquestionably put country over party and coordinate with Democrats to evict Trump from the White House—if not out of good faith, then at the very least to preserve their own credibility as lawmakers.  Sadly, the quotes in this Access Hollywood tape shouldn’t be too surprising coming from a man who has been credibly accused of sexual misconduct by over 25 women since the 1970s, but it is nonetheless deeply disturbing to hear the leader of the free world speaking so openly about violating women. Though Trump once famously claimed that he “could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody” without facing consequences, he’s about to learn that he is not, in fact, invincible, as surely not even Trump’s most ardent fans can listen to this vulgar recording and still believe he is fit to lead our nation. After hearing this recording, the only people who would continue to support Donald Trump would be the most spineless sycophants and ass-kissers imaginable, but thankfully all self-respecting Americans have more dignity than that.   After all, no matter where you stand politically, there is no room for moral ambiguity when it comes to sexual assault, and we trust that there’s not a single Republican who won’t stand with Democrats in agreement that anyone who proudly admits to committing sexual violence against women should be disqualified from holding public office. Sure, they’ve been more than willing to stick with the president through some truly abhorrent behavior in the past, but at the end of the day, they’re human beings with wives and daughters and other important women in their lives, and to continue supporting Trump at this point would essentially be like telling those women, I do not respect you, and you exist only for the sexual gratification of men. There are a lot of sleazy lawmakers in Washington, but it’s comforting to know that there are none who would continue pledging their loyalty to someone who unabashedly and forcefully indulges his own sexual desires at the expense of his victims’ very personhoods.  What’s especially troubling about this Access Hollywood tape is that Trump freely admitted to his sex crimes while he knew he was being recorded—he wasn’t trying to hide it. If he’s willing to speak so cavalierly about something as monstrous as committing sexual assault, just imagine how horrible the stuff he’s actually hiding must be. It’s a good thing this tape leaked just in time for the election. Could you imagine having to spend four whole years under the authority of a man who openly delights in violating women and wields his extraordinary power to strip the humanity of others? America could never recover from such an embarrassment, but thankfully we’re a nation of principled citizens with deeply held values who would never tolerate, let alone empower, such a despicable leader. Phew. We’re really dodging a bullet here. Now that America has heard Trump brazenly boasting about committing sex crimes, there’s no way anyone can continue dismissing unflattering assessments of the man as “fake news”. He has declared in his own words that he is the most despicable type of predator that one can be, and anyone who thinks he should serve a second term at this point is obviously either insane or devoid of empathy to a psychopathic degree. Not that we’re saying such people actually exist—Americans aren’t that crazy—but with all the chaos and misinformation in politics these past four years, we figure we might as well state the obvious just in case."
An Awesome TV Moment! Nick Cannon Removed The Mask Of A ‘Masked Singer’ Contestant And Found His Own Head Under The Mask And Screamed In Horror As The Audience Cheered,N/A,https://clickhole.com/an-awesome-tv-moment-nick-cannon-removed-the-mask-of-a-masked-singer-contestant-and-found-his-own-head-under-the-mask-and-screamed-in-horror-as-the-audience-cheered/,"If you’re a fan of reality television, then get excited, because one of the greatest TV moments ever just transpired on last night’s episode of The Masked Singer: the show’s host Nick Cannon removed the mask of a contestant and found his own head under the mask and screamed in horror as the audience cheered. Incredible! Talk about must-see TV! The amazing spectacle took place at the end of last night’s episode of The Masked Singer, when the contestant “Rhinoceros” performed an underwhelming cover of “Waterfalls” by TLC. After the panel voted the contestant as the loser, Nick Cannon came over and ripped off Rhinoceros’s mask and found himself staring into his own eyes. The unmasked Nick Cannon smiled as the first Nick Cannon started screaming in wide-eyed horror. The studio audience was absolutely loving it! Everyone in the crowd was on their feet cheering and clapping as Nick Cannon fell to his knees and screamed, “How can I be the Rhinoceros? What does it mean?” It was a perfect moment that any fan of The Masked Singer will surely remember for the rest of their lives. As Nick Cannon continued screaming and gesturing wordlessly at the identical version of himself, panelist Ken Jeong burst into tears and screamed at co-panelist Robin Thicke, “You promised me this would never happen!” Robin Thicke started vomiting and could not respond. Panelist Jenny McCarthy hid under her desk in the fetal position while Nicole Scherzinger shrieked, “Now there are three Nick Cannons!” before sprinting out of the studio through the emergency exit.  And if the moment wasn’t already exciting enough, the Nick Cannon wearing the rhinoceros costume then leaned close to his weeping doppelganger and whispered, “Same person” before turning to the audience and shrieking, “What am I for? What is my meaning?” over and over again while the crowd continued to give an ecstatic standing ovation and high five one another. The original Nick Cannon, visibly on the brink of a mental breakdown, started shouting, “WHICH IS WHICH?” and the audience responded by chanting “WHICH IS WHICH? WHICH IS WHICH?” as loudly as they could. It was exactly the type of thrilling moment that we tune into The Masked Singer to see! Just perfect! If you were one of the people who got to watch this happen in real-time last night, you’re incredibly lucky. This is hands down one of the greatest moments in the history of reality TV, and people are going to be talking about the time that Nick Cannon found his own head underneath one of the Masked Singer masks for years to come.

Epic Clapback! Joe Biden Just Tweeted At Trump That His Nickname Should Be ‘Awesome Joe’ Because He Is Awesome,N/A,https://clickhole.com/epic-clapback-joe-biden-just-tweeted-at-trump-that-his-nickname-should-be-awesome-joe-because-he-is-awesome/,"President Donald Trump has proven that he has no shortage of nicknames for his political opponents, but earlier today, the former Vice President showed everyone that he wasn’t just going to sit back and take it. After President Trump called Joe Biden “Sleepy Joe” in a tweet this morning, Joe Biden clapped back and said his nickname should be “Awesome Joe” because he is awesome. Mic. F*cking. Drop. Looks like “Sleepy Joe” isn’t so “sleepy” now, huh Mr. Trump? Check out the immediately iconic Twitter exchange between President Trump and the 2020 Democratic nominee below:  We are on our feet and cheering right now. This is a clapback of seriously epic proportions! This could be the move that seals the 2020 election in Biden’s favor and we are here for it. But the former Senator wasn’t ready to stop there. Biden’s next incredible move was to post the following tweet where he tried to get a hashtag announcing his new nickname trending:  While it’s only been a few hours since Biden first used the hashtag, it’s already inspired several dozen of his supporters to use it, too!  President Trump has yet to respond to this devastating clapback from the Biden campaign, which just goes to show that Awesome Joe (we get chills just saying it!) is not to be messed with. It’s safe to say that when you come for Joe Biden, expect to get hit back!"
Flying Too Close To The Sun: Donald Trump Jr. Just Introduced Himself At A White House Dinner As ‘Big Donald Trump Jr.’ And His Father Slapped Him In The Face,N/A,https://clickhole.com/flying-too-close-to-the-sun-donald-trump-jr-just-introduced-himself-at-a-white-house-dinner-as-big-donald-trump-jr-and-his-father-slapped-him-in-the-face/,"Proximity to power can be just as intoxicating as power itself, and one of the president’s children just learned a hard lesson about what can happen if you let that proximity go to your head: Donald Trump Jr. introduced himself at a White House dinner as “Big Donald Trump Jr.” and his father slapped him in the face. Yikes. Looks like Don Jr. was taken to task in a major way after getting a bit too big for his britches! The incident took place last night in the White House dining room at a function for around 100 members of the Trump Administration and foreign dignitaries. Donald Trump Jr. shook the hand of a member of Mike Pence’s staff and said, “How’s it going? My name’s Big Donald Trump Jr.” at which point his father, overhearing him, wound up and slapped him hard in the face before saying, “Shut up. You are regular-sized. Your name is Regular Donald Jr. or even Small Donald. Don’t ever say that again.” White House officials and members of President Trump’s cabinet were seen nodding in approval and shaking the president’s hand shortly after the incident. Don Jr. must have been so embarrassed! According to White House insiders, after getting slapped by his father, Don Jr. snuck around the dinner party quietly introducing himself by names such as “Huge Don Jr.” and “Massive Donny Smalls,” which prompted President Trump to chase his son around the room shouting, “Hey! Stop that! No! You’re small!” and slapping him in the face every time he caught him. Following each slap, Don Jr. would scream, “I’m sorry! I’m sorry! I’m nothing! I’m a worm!” before whispering, “I’m actually Humongous Don Jr.,” to the nearest person to him once his father was out of earshot. One time he accidentally whispered that his name was “Galaxy-Sized Donald Trump Jr.” to President Trump after President Trump had just slapped him, causing the president to immediately slap him again. Senator Lindsey Graham reportedly said, “Very impressive slap, Mr. President,” after which President Trump spit into Mr. Graham’s drink. Graham then reportedly said, “Thank you, sir” and walked away. Those present at the event also say that later in the night, Don Jr. stood on his tip-toes and whispered, “Taller” very quietly to himself, and President Trump sprinted across the room and punched him in the stomach. Additionally, toward the end of the night, Don Jr. went into the bathroom and changed into a large inflatable sumo wrestler costume and started telling people he was a bodybuilder. President Trump responded by stabbing his son in the leg with a dinner fork. Don Jr. just didn’t seem willing to learn his lesson that he is a regular-sized man! President Trump addressed these multiple altercations with his son in a tweet earlier today, saying: “Yesterday I slapped my little son Donald Trump Jr. multiple times for claiming that his name was Big DONALD Trump Jr. He is REGULAR SIZED or even SMALL. NO REGRETS!!!” Trump Jr., however, has yet to publicly acknowledge the incident.  While the confrontation between the president and his son seems to be over for now, it looks like Don Jr. has learned a tough lesson about staying in his place. Here’s hoping he stays humble and doesn’t introduce himself as Big Donald Trump Jr. any time soon, or else the consequences might be even more dire!"
Productivity FTW: Slack Has Unveiled A New Feature Where It’ll Shut Off For 20 Minutes A Day So You Can Actually Get Some Goddamn Work Done For Once,N/A,https://clickhole.com/productivity-ftw-slack-has-unveiled-a-new-feature-where-itll-shut-off-for-20-minutes-a-day-so-you-can-actually-get-some-goddamn-work-done-for-once/,"In recent years, Slack has rapidly established itself as the preeminent platform for workplace messaging, and it looks like it’s only going to become more popular, as the company just announced plans to make the user experience better than ever before: Slack has unveiled a new feature where it’ll shut off for 20 minutes a day so you can actually get some goddamn work done for once.  Awesome! This is going to help people get SO much more work done. The company announced the new feature in a press release earlier today, revealing that users will now have the option to set their status to “ACTUALLY DOING WORK,” which, once activated, will block users from accessing the platform for 20 whole minutes so that they can have a little time to knock some items off their to-do list without constantly being interrupted by messages from coworkers. The awesome feature will block all incoming notifications while it’s in use, giving users a much-needed window of productivity that’s totally free from the incessant chit-chat and Parks And Recreation GIFs that inundate group channels and make focusing on work virtually impossible. For those who are worried that the feature might cause them to miss out on some hilarious workplace banter, fear not, because once you leave ACTUALLY DOING WORK mode, all the messages you missed while being productive will be presented to you with a series of incredibly loud dings so that you can then spend the next hour or so replying to all the threads and giving emojis reacts to posts to show your coworkers that you did, in fact, read their messages, and that you did indeed LOL. However, if 20 minutes is too long for you to go without this kind of stimulation, the feature also includes a methadone-like notification generator which, when clicked, will briefly populate your browser with a flurry of colorful internet stimuli to satisfy your brain’s chemical dependence on inane bullshit and tide you over for the remainder of your 20-minute productivity period.  So cool! This is bound to be a total life-saver for the millions of Americans who really need to get some shit done but are hopelessly addicted to a largely pointless messaging platform that every business thinks they need to have for some reason. Kudos to Slack for totally rethinking the way we work!"
Going Too Far? President Trump Is Attacking Joe Biden’s Son Jeb For Losing The 2016 Primary,N/A,https://clickhole.com/going-too-far-president-trump-is-attacking-joe-bidens-son-jeb-for-losing-the-2016-primary/,"After making aggressive remarks about Former Vice President Joe Biden’s sons during the first presidential debate, President Donald Trump just proved that he’s not about to lay off the personal matters anytime soon: President Trump is now attacking Joe Biden’s son Jeb for losing the 2016 primary. Wow. President Trump isn’t one to avoid an ad-hominem attack, but these comments have some pundits wondering if he’s gone too far.  During this morning’s press briefing, President Trump continued his attacks on his opposing candidate by stating that he easily crushed Joe Biden’s son during the Republican presidential primary in 2016, because “Jeb ran an awful, uninspired campaign, just like his father’s doing now.” “Biden’s done a terrible job raising his sons, from Hunter, who set the record for the most amount of crack snorted in the military, to Jeb, who dropped out of the Republican primary early in 2016 because he couldn’t even bear to stay in the fight and try to take on my amazing MAGA campaign,” said President Trump. “If Biden had raised him right, Low Energy Jeb would be your president. But Jeb Biden and his little exclamation point lost sourly to me. He was absolutely pathetic, just pathetic, begging his audiences to ‘please clap.’ That’s the kind of pathetic wimpiness that runs in the Biden family, and Joe definitely passed that wimpiness down to Jeb on the day he was born!” Reporters at the White House have confirmed that President Trump concluded his attack on Biden’s family by adding that if all of the Bidens weren’t such losers, then they would all be the president right now. Former Vice President Biden has yet to respond to Trump’s comments, but it’s safe to say that as the election draws to a close, no topic is off the table for President Trump, not even the sensitive issue of Jeb Biden’s disastrous 2016 presidential campaign. While pundits confirm that Trump’s remarks on Jeb Biden are playing favorably with his supporters, time will tell how these attacks against Joe Biden’s middle son Jeb will truly affect his campaign."
Heartbreaking: This Kid Is Being Bullied Because Her Family Is Only Subscribed To Peacock Premium With Ads Instead Of Its Ad-Free Premium Plus Plan,N/A,https://clickhole.com/heartbreaking-this-kid-is-being-bullied-because-her-family-is-only-subscribed-to-peacock-premium-with-ads-instead-of-its-ad-free-premium-plus-plan/,"Bullying is a tragic epidemic affecting millions of kids per year, and this most recent example of a child being mercilessly tormented by her peers shows just how devastating it can be: this kid is being bullied because her family is only subscribed to Peacock Premium with ads instead of its ad-free Premium Plus plan. Just heartbreaking.  When 13-year-old Lila Madario returned to school this year, she couldn’t wait to talk to her friends about all of the incredible shows and movies she’d been watching on Peacock, the new streaming service from NBC that debuted over the summer. Tragically, though, when she made a joke about all the ads she’d had to sit through while binge watching Zoey’s Extraordinary Playlist, her friends realized that Lila merely had the $4.99 Peacock Premium subscription, rather than the $9.99 Peacock Premium Plus (Ad-Free) plan, and they erupted into laughter as they mockingly asked how she even managed to get through one episode with all the ad breaks, let alone the whole season. Word that Lila only had a Peacock Premium membership spread quickly around the school, and as she walked through the halls later that day, she could hear students calling her a “commercial-watching loser” under their breath. Since then, Lila has been on the receiving end of some relentless bullying by her peers. When Lila tried to join in on a conversation about the season 3 premiere of AP Bio, her classmate interrupted her and said, “You know, the scene where some lady was using a Swiffer for 30 seconds wasn’t part of the episode. That was an ad, Lila.” In another incident, Lila asked her friends if they wanted to come to a sleepover at her house and watch a rom-com like they did on most weekends, but one replied, “And watch the same commercial two million times during He’s Just Not That Into You? Yeah, right.” Good God. This is just so sad to see. No one should be treated cruelly just because their family has the cheaper Peacock plan with ads. Lila has tried to defend herself by reminding her classmates that not only does the Peacock Premium plan with ads plan have way more TV shows and movies than the Peacock Free option, but it also has the same 10,000 hours of content and early access to late-night shows as Peacock Premium Plus. Unfortunately, though, her efforts haven’t made any difference: just last week, her friends stopped letting her sit with them at lunch because they said their table was for “Peacock Premium Plus members” only. The next day, while Lila was sitting alone in the cafeteria, the student she’s had a crush on for years sat down next to her and asked if she’d seen the Gatorade commercial that shows up on Peacock, and when she said yes, he laughed in her face and said he’d never actually be the kind of poor loser who has to see an ad every seven minutes while watching Parks and Rec. Since the bullying started, Lila has been begging her parents to upgrade to Peacock Premium Plus, but her parents, already set back financially by the monthly payments for Netflix, Disney+, Hulu, HBOMax, CBS All Access, and Apple TV+, have refused to change the plan. Lila even asked if it could be considered an early birthday gift, but her parents reminded her that she used that reasoning to get a month’s worth of $7.99 ad-free Quibi back in June to binge Chrissy’s Court. This is all so tragic. Everyone should be treated equally, regardless of what Peacock plan their family has. Here’s hoping that Lila’s peers come around and stop treating her like an outcast for only having Peacock Premium sometime soon, and may we all one day live in a world where ugly bullying like this no longer exists!"
The Amazing Science Of Blankets: Researchers At MIT Have Determined That The Blanket Makes You Warm Because It Goes On Top Of You,N/A,https://clickhole.com/the-amazing-science-of-blankets-researchers-at-mit-have-determined-that-the-blanket-makes-you-warm-because-it-goes-on-top-of-you/,"Science lovers, get excited, because one of the top research universities in the country has just announced a fascinating theory that will undoubtedly have the physics world buzzing: researchers at MIT have determined that the blanket makes you warm because it goes on top of you! Wow! The science of blankets is truly mind-blowing! A thermodynamics-focused research team in MIT’s Department of Physics has been working tirelessly on experiments testing the material properties and thermal capacity of blankets for more than six months, ultimately determining that blankets are able to work thanks to you go under them where it is nice and warm. “The blanket—it makes you hot by going on top of your legs and torso,” said David Rubinstein, a graduate researcher on the team. “When the blanket finds itself all spread out over a person, it begins its work keeping the hot air more near to the body, creating what we call a ‘comfy, cozy area.’” “This is very, very good,” Rubinstein added. Amazing. Finally someone figured out why the blanket is so warm! This is incredible! The MIT team hypothesized early on that the blanket might keep you warm because it is soft, or because it goes on your bed. But countless hours spent logging blankets’ densities and specific heat capacities yielded a different result. “The blanket — oh, he is wonderful,” said research team lead Marlena Rodriguez. “But the important variable is go below, because this is how the blanket can protect you.” She went on to explain how after initial weeks spent testing what would happen if a person simply touched a blanket, or if he put it in the yard right outside his bedroom window, Rodriguez’s team came to the conclusion that cool air would still affect a person’s body temperature, and that the blanket would only be effective if it was resting safely atop their body. “Going underneath the blanket is nothing short of warm,” she concluded. Well, this is nothing short of fascinating! The place where science and blankets intersect is certainly worthy of more study, though this theory alone is extremely enlightening. Thank you for doing this important research, MIT! We love blanket!"
Preparing For The Worst: President Trump Has Asked For Ronald McDonald To Sing ‘Sexual Healing’ At His Funeral If He Dies Of Covid-19,N/A,https://clickhole.com/preparing-for-the-worst-president-trump-has-asked-for-ronald-mcdonald-to-sing-sexual-healing-at-his-funeral-if-he-dies-of-covid-19/,"Ever since President Trump announced his Covid-19 diagnosis late last week, he has publicly maintained an optimistic attitude about the prospect of making a full recovery. But according to inside sources, the president is privately deeply concerned and is even making preparations for if the worst should happen: President Trump has reportedly requested that Ronald McDonald sing “Sexual Healing” at his funeral should he die of Covid-19.  Wow. It seems like Trump is much more worried about his health than he’s letting on.  According to top-level White House aides speaking on the condition of anonymity, President Trump amended his last will and testament earlier today to reflect his wish that, in the event of his death, Ronald McDonald sing the Marvin Gaye classic “Sexual Healing” in front of the casket at his funeral. Trump also reportedly specified that the song be performed with a karaoke machine so that there’s no live band onstage to distract from the beautiful spectacle of Ronald McDonald serenading the commander-in-chief’s corpse.  “I can confirm that the president has asked the executor of his estate to arrange for ‘the hamburger clown’ to sing ‘the pornography song’ at his memorial service,” said a source familiar with the matter. “Mr. Trump says he has great respect for Ronald McDonald because of all he has accomplished, and he can think of no better individual to comfort grieving Americans with a moving rendition of this very erotic song.” White House sources also revealed that, while detailing his request, a big smile spread across the president’s face as he fantasized about lying peacefully in his coffin to the tune of Ronald McDonald crooning the words, “Sexual healing is good for me. Makes me feel so fine, it’s such a rush. Helps to relieve the mind, and it’s good for us,” in his nasally tenor. The sources added that Trump demanded that Ronald McDonald sing “Sexual Healing” two separate times at his funeral: once “standing still like a normal clown” at the beginning of the service, and a second time later in the service where he should “sadly thrust his hips” to capture the song’s sexy energy.  Wow! Sounds like it will be a memorial service for the ages. While there is still a great deal that is unknown about Trump’s battle with Covid-19, it’s clear from these reports that the situation is more serious than he’s making it out to be. But if there’s one thing we do know for sure, it’s that should the president ultimately succumb to this disease, the nation will get to witness a truly breathtaking rendition of “Sexual Healing” performed by one of the world’s most respected clowns, and chances are there won’t be a dry eye in the house!"
Tough But Fair: The American Psychiatric Association Has Announced That Some Of You Could Stand To Re-Stigmatize Your Depression,N/A,https://clickhole.com/tough-but-fair-the-american-psychiatric-association-has-announced-that-some-of-you-could-stand-to-re-stigmatize-your-depression/,"In recent years, there has been a widespread surge in efforts to destigmatize mental illness, with many people bravely coming forward to publicly discuss their battles with depression. But as our society continues to grapple with its perception of mental illness, the American Psychiatric Association has come forward to caution that there are some people who could really stand to re-stigmatize their depression. Ouch. While the destigmatization of depression is generally an amazing thing, this ultimately seems like a fair assessment by the APA for a select few. The APA announced their new position in a statement this morning, explaining that some people’s outspokenness about their depression is “getting to be a bit much,” and adding that it will never be possible to fully normalize mental illness if people are being super obnoxious about it.   “Your depression doesn’t have to be your entire identity,” said the APA in the statement. “Stop putting it as your Twitter bios as if it’s your only personality trait. You don’t have to start every conversation with a stranger by telling them about your messed-up brain chemistry. It’s not like suffering from clinical depression is a rare or special thing. Like, pretty much everyone we know is depressed. So maybe just cool it with things like commenting, ‘Wow, wish I wasn’t depressed, must be nice’ on every positive Facebook post you see. That’s not a ‘healthy conversation,’ that’s some weird manipulative nonsense. You’re not helping yourself or others.” “If you are someone who has simply become more comfortable discussing their depression openly but isn’t exactly going nuts talking about it, feel free to ignore what we’re saying here and carry on, because that’s completely healthy,” the statement continued. “But if you’re attempting to manipulate everyone around you by turning your mental illness into the only thing anyone around you is allowed to talk about, it’s probably time for you to dial things back a notch.” Damn.  While this is undeniably an intense take from the APA, it’s tough to really disagree with it. Yes, life is hard, but you don’t need to constantly be reminding people of that. Kudos to the ADA for not mincing words about this difficult topic and reminding people that it’s possible to talk openly and constructively about mental health without making it your entire deal."
The Perils Of Climate Change: Scientists Have Predicted That The Shrub Concealing This Man’s Genitals Will Be Destroyed In A Wildfire By 2050,N/A,https://clickhole.com/the-perils-of-climate-change-scientists-have-predicted-that-the-shrub-concealing-this-mans-genitals-will-be-destroyed-in-a-wildfire-by-2050/,"It seems as if every day we learn of a new environmental catastrophe caused by man-made climate change, and unfortunately it looks like things are only going to get worse: Scientists have predicted that by 2050, the shrub concealing this man’s genitals will be destroyed in wildfires caused by global warming. Terrifying. This should be a serious wakeup call for anyone who isn’t yet taking climate change seriously.  For years, the nude man has been standing outside smiling with his hands on his hips, and the only thing preventing the world from seeing his genitals has been the waist-high shrub he’s been standing behind. Unfortunately, researchers now say that unless drastic and immediate efforts are taken to slow or reverse the effects of climate change, increased instances of wildfires will almost certainly lead to the bush being destroyed, thus exposing everyone to an unobstructed view of the man’s penis and testicles. “Unfortunately, with the damage that’s already been inflicted on the environment, there’s not much we can do at this point to prevent the destruction of the shrub blocking this man’s normal-sized penis as well as his testicles, which are the penis’s two wives,” said U.C. Berkeley climatologist Dr. Phillip Gladstone. “While many of us will have died by the time wildfires destroy the bush, our children and grandchildren will still be here, and they will suffer the consequences of seeing this man’s regular ding-dong flapping in the breeze like a windsock. It will be devastating. The man’s penis is neither big nor small. It’s right in the middle. Thank you.” As if this news weren’t dire enough, many scientists are also predicting that climate change will lead to other kinds of extreme weather conditions such as hurricanes, which will cause the nude man’s penis to flap about wildly in the wind and potentially hypnotize people who stare at it for too long. Researchers have also warned that once the shrub is destroyed, it will be impossible to ignore the nude man, because every few hours he lets out a blood-curdling scream for no reason, and everyone always turns to look at him. Even when he is screaming he never stops smiling. This should serve as a chilling reminder of the very real impact climate change will have on all of our lives. For years we’ve taken for granted that the shrub blocking the nude man’s penis would always be there, but that was foolish and ignorant. When a wildfire burns down the shrub and we can all see the nude man’s penis and he’s screaming and smiling and we’re looking at his normal-sized penis flapping in the wind, we’ll wonder why we never tried to prevent it while we still could.

Fitness Nut To The End: Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s Headstone Says Nothing But ‘GYM RAT’ On It,N/A,https://clickhole.com/fitness-nut-to-the-end-ruth-bader-ginsburgs-headstone-says-nothing-but-gym-rat-on-it/,"When Ruth Bader Ginsburg passed away earlier this month, the United States lost a true pioneer and titan of the judicial system. There are many memorable things that Justice Ginsburg achieved in her lifetime, but the inscription on her headstone will commemorate the one that the deceased judge valued the most: Ginsburg’s headstone says nothing but “GYM RAT” on it. This is deeply moving. Even in death, her commitment to fitness remains. The headstone, which was unveiled in a private ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery yesterday afternoon, does not include standard details such as Ginsburg’s name, birth date, or death date. Instead, it just says “GYM RAT” with no additional information. For years we have seen photographs and video footage of Ginsburg hitting the gym and lifting weights, and now her famous dedication to working out and building muscle will be the enduring legacy of this incredible woman.  “More than a lawyer and more than a judge, Ruth was a gym rat, a muscular zealot who worshipped at the altar of the Iron Church of Fitness,” said Ginsburg’s family in a statement. “One hundred years from now, when future generations of little girls see this headstone, they will say, ‘I have no idea who is buried here, but they must have lifted weights constantly.’ We can think of no message more fitting to be inscribed upon our beloved Ruth’s headstone.” Absolutely beautiful!  Although RBG’s name and legal achievements may one day be forgotten, her strict regimen of weightlifting, push-ups, and sit-ups will live eternally in the hearts and minds of all Americans. May she always be remembered as exactly what she was: a gym rat in life and in death."
Improving Law Enforcement: The NYPD Is Euthanizing All Of Its Police Horses After Remembering About Cars,N/A,https://clickhole.com/improving-law-enforcement-the-nypd-is-euthanizing-all-of-its-police-horses-after-remembering-about-cars/,"Now more than ever, Americans are looking to law enforcement officers to make positive, forward-thinking changes in how they do things, and here’s an encouraging story of one police department that’s doing just that: The NYPD just announced that they are euthanizing all of their police horses after remembering about cars. In a press conference earlier today, the NYPD revealed that they have begun the process of decommissioning and slaughtering their fleet of police horses, saying that it recently occurred to them that the costly, high-maintenance animals could be entirely replaced by cars, which are widely available, have predictable temperaments, and are all-around superior to horses in virtually every regard. The department explained that cars are far better equipped to perform in dense traffic and dizzying exhaust fumes than horses, which are easily startled by loud noises and can only achieve a pitiful max speed of around 30 MPH, leaving them woefully ill-equipped to navigate the city’s busy streets in pursuit of crime. “Horses don’t have seatbelts, they don’t have sirens or a horn you can honk, and you can’t even take them on the highway—it just no longer makes sense to keep committing so much time and effort to maintaining these animals when cars are so much better than them in every single way,” said New York City Police Commissioner Dermot Shea, adding that you also don’t have to feed cars half their body weight in oats each day or collect their feces with a shovel, which is appealing. “The fact that there’s a unit of measurement called ‘horsepower’ that gauges how many hundreds of times stronger a car is than a horse makes us pretty confident we’re making the right decision here.” “Rarely in the line of duty does an officer encounter a situation where it’d be useful to have a horse—it’s not like first responders were calling dispatch on 9/11 to send in horse backup,” he continued. “Cars, on the other hand…cars are just fantastic.”  Shea went on to say that a designated NYPD task force has been slaughtering the horses with a penetrative bolt gun and then selling them off to a rendering plant, where their bodies are being broken down into crude materials for industrial manufacturing, thereby contributing much more to the world than they would’ve had they remained cops and alive. Additionally, it was noted that killing off the horses will save the department millions of dollars a year, money that will then be reallocated to purchase more police cars and more sirens for the police cars they already have.  This is a seriously major move from the NYPD, and while there are certainly more urgent things they could’ve focused on reforming first, you can’t deny that this was a good call. After all, it’s hard to feel safe when those who’ve been entrusted with protecting the general public are large animals who have literally no fucking clue that that’s their job. There is simply no place for a horse on a modern police force, and here’s hoping that police departments in other cities will soon realize this and follow the NYPD’s lead by slaughtering their horses as well."
LEAKED: The List Of Dependents On President Trump’s Tax Returns Makes It Clear That He Has Absolutely No Idea What Anyone In His Family Is Named,N/A,https://clickhole.com/leaked-the-list-of-dependents-on-president-trumps-tax-returns-makes-it-clear-that-he-has-absolutely-no-idea-what-anyone-in-his-family-is-named/,"Following a bombshell report from The New York Times over the weekend that exposed years of Donald Trump’s tax returns, we now have a much clearer picture of the president’s financial history, and not only is it clear that he’s not the brilliant businessman he’s always painted himself as, but it also seems that he’s not much of a family man, either: the list of dependents on President Trump’s tax returns makes it obvious that he has absolutely no idea what anyone in his family is named. Wow. This is definitely not a good look for the commander-in-chief.  In examining 18 years of Trump’s tax returns, the Times found that the president never once managed to get his family members’ names correct when listing them as dependents, oftentimes just seemingly throwing out random guesses as to what they’re called. The report discovered 22 different names that the president used for his wife alone, including “Meln,” “Lips Lady,” and “Marcus.” Conversely, the only name he managed to consistently list over the years is that of someone named “The Frogman,” who is not a known family member of Trump’s but is nonetheless constantly referenced by the president in his financial documents, oftentimes in contexts wholly unrelated to taxes.  And it’s not just family members’ names that Trump doesn’t know. It also seems that the president is largely oblivious to how he is related to his loved ones, as from 2009 to 2013, Trump claimed all of his individual family members as his spouse and identified them with names like, “Son Wife,” “Poland Wife,” and “LOUD HUSBAND.” Further, for the last five years he has inexplicably listed “Michelle Obama (WIFE)” as one of his children.  While there was initially some speculation that Trump may have intentionally gotten his family members’ names wrong on the forms as part of some ploy to cheat on his taxes, financial experts have since ruled out this possibility, noting that there is no way to win tax breaks by inaccurately identifying dependents and that it is not possible that this is an intentional strategy—he just simply does not know the names of the people he lives with. How this news will affect the president’s reelection prospects is yet to be seen, but it goes without saying that this is something he’d rather not be dealing with this late in the election season."
Good News: The CDC Says Watching A High School Football Practice Alone In The Bleachers While Looking Sullen And Staring Longingly At The Quarterback Who Doesn’t Even Notice You Because You Wear Glasses And Have Never Spoken To Anyone At School Except Your Gay Best Friend Is A ‘Low Risk’ Activity For COVID-19,N/A,https://clickhole.com/good-news-the-cdc-says-watching-a-high-school-football-practice-alone-in-the-bleachers-while-looking-sullen-and-staring-longingly-at-the-quarterback-who-doesnt-even-notice-you-because-you-we/,"While so much of regular life is on hold due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, it’s great to know that there are still some activities we can safely enjoy: The CDC says that watching a high school football practice alone in the bleachers while looking sullen and staring longingly at the quarterback who doesn’t even notice you because you wear glasses and have never spoken to anyone at school except your gay best friend is a “low risk” activity for COVID-19. Awesome!  According to new COVID-19 safety guidelines released by the CDC, sitting all alone in the bleachers after school while watching the quarterback practice as you doodle hearts with his name inside them all over the front of your AP history notebook is a safe activity that does not put you at an increased risk of contracting COVID-19. The CDC says that people can even feel comfortable passionately making out with the quarterback after he dramatically storms off the field and tells you that he’s loved you since the first time he laid eyes on you, so long as the whole thing turns out to be a daydream that you snap out of when a rogue football flies off the field and hits you right in the face. Additionally, because the quarterback is over six feet tall, he will be able to follow social distancing protocol when he stands over you in the bleachers and asks if you’re okay before handing you your broken glasses and running back to practice. But just because an activity is low risk doesn’t mean that proper precautions shouldn’t be taken. “When you’re walking across campus while talking on the phone to your gay best friend—who just cattily blew off a customer at the Jamba Juice where he works to answer your call—and whining to him about how the quarterback doesn’t even know you exist because you have brown hair and are on the debate team, it’s essential to wear a mask so that you don’t spread the virus when you accidentally bump into the quarterback, causing all of your books to fall to the ground,” explained CDC director Robert Redfield. “It should be noted, though, that the risk of transmission will increase as the quarterback bends down to help pick up your papers, which is why it’s crucial that both of you leave your masks on as he flips through your biology textbook and realizes that you guys are in the same class, all while your gay best friend can be distantly heard through your phone’s tinny speaker saying, ‘Ohmygod, are you talking to him RIGHT NOW? Get it, girl! You total slutbag!’ before you hang up on him.” “Further, it is advised that you remain six feet apart when the quarterback asks if he can copy your science homework, and you agree, even though cheating scares you as a straight-A student with your sights set on Yale, because you think it’ll make him like you, although your heart will drop when he walks away saying, ‘Thanks for the homework help, Nancy,’ since Nancy is definitely not your name,” he continued.  Excitingly, the new guidelines state that there are even low risk ways to attend the big party that the quarterback invites you to as a way of thanking you for letting him copy your homework—the very party that your gay best friend assures you is “totally a date” while he helps you do your makeup, going so far as to take off your glasses and straighten your curly hair, proving that you’ve secretly been a total hottie this whole time. However, to minimize exposure to potential carriers, it is best that you wear a mask to the party and only stay just long enough to see the quarterback kissing the head cheerleader across the room, at which point it’s recommended that you run out of the party in tears and avoid making contact with the nerdy guy from your math class who’s chasing after you to see if you’re alright because he’s secretly in love with you, and if you ever just opened your eyes you’d see that he’s a really great guy who actually likes you for who you are, unlike that conceited jock who, in retrospect, you realize has been a huge asshole all along. Additionally, the CDC says that crying in your parent’s basement after the party while eating ice cream straight out of the carton and watching a rom-com while texting your gay best friend about how things are never going to go your way and you’re doomed to be alone forever is generally considered a safe activity. Amazing! This is definitely going to be great for high schoolers who are currently lying awake in their beds obsessively looking at the head cheerleader’s Instagram and wondering what she has that they don’t. Thanks to the CDC for bringing us some much-needed good news!"
A Career Cut Short: Bryce Harper Has Quit Baseball Because He Says One Of The Cardboard Cutout Fans Called Him A ‘Fat Boy’,N/A,https://clickhole.com/a-career-cut-short-bryce-harper-has-quit-baseball-because-he-says-one-of-the-cardboard-cutout-fans-called-him-a-fat-boy/,"Thanks to COVID-19, the 2020 MLB season has been played under less than ideal circumstances, and as a result, one of baseball’s biggest stars appears to be ready to move on from the game for good: Philadelphia Phillies right fielder Bryce Harper has quit baseball because he says one of the cardboard cutout fans called him a “fat boy.” Damn. This is a seriously shocking announcement from one of the brightest stars in the game. Speaking to reporters after yesterday’s double header, Harper opened up about a traumatic incident that occurred late in Game 2, when a cardboard cutout of a fan seated near the right field foul pole whispered, “Hey there, fat boy,” at the Phillies slugger, causing him to immediately burst into tears and storm off the field. While nobody else has been able to corroborate Harper’s account of events, he remains completely distraught and says that in addition to calling him a fat boy, the cardboard cutout called him a “pig’s lawyer” and “a rat-faced warthog man.” The six-time all star said that the comments hurt his feelings so much that he no longer has the will to keep playing. “One of the paper men called me a fat boy and now I don’t want to play baseball anymore,” Harper told reporters. “I am not a fat boy. I am a muscular person who looks exactly like Jimmy Stewart from the movies. That cardboard cutout has no idea what it is talking about. I refuse to play a sport where a two-dimensional man in a porkpie hat can call me fat boy with impunity.” The Phillies’ front office tried to smooth things over with Harper by taking the offending cardboard cutout into the stadium parking lot and setting it on fire, but Harper remained inconsolable and shortly thereafter doubled down on his decision by ripping up his $330 million contract and feeding his baseball glove through a paper shredder.  Wow. Sounds like his mind is made up. This is definitely a major setback for the Phillies and a huge blow for baseball fans everywhere who were hoping to watch Bryce Harper continue to dazzle on the ball field for many years to come. Now that he’s been called a fat boy by a cardboard cutout, he’ll have to find a new career, and the Phillies will have to find someone to fill the massive hole Harper has left in their organization. Hopefully the Phillies can sign a new right fielder who has a slightly thicker skin and won’t quit the sport entirely just because one of the cardboard cutouts mumbles an insult at him!"
"A Silver Lining To Covid: After Months Of Decreased Pollution With Humans In Lockdown, Gorilla Populations Are Starting To Develop Rudimentary Nuclear Weapons",N/A,https://clickhole.com/a-silver-lining-to-covid-after-months-of-decreased-pollution-with-humans-in-lockdown-gorilla-populations-are-starting-to-develop-rudimentary-nuclear-weapons/,"As much as the COVID-19 pandemic has devastated life as we know it, it turns out that it also comes with some benefits, particularly in nature, where animals are suddenly thriving thanks to the prolonged decrease in human activity. Case in point: The decline in human interference and pollution has allowed gorilla populations to start developing rudimentary nuclear weapons.  Amazing! It is truly beautiful to see animals living life as they were always meant to. Over the past six months, researchers in the Democratic Republic of the Congo have observed how troops of eastern lowland gorillas, empowered by the sudden absence of air and noise pollution, have slowly begun tinkering with uranium ore and using it to achieve nuclear fission in order to develop crude atomic devices. No longer disturbed by industrial interference, the primates finally have the peace and quiet they need to cultivate their own nuclear programs, and with lower carbon emissions making way for a boom in flora growth, the animals now have a wealth of new vines, tree barks, and fruits to use towards assembling instruments of apocalyptic destruction.     Researchers have marveled as they’ve observed the gorillas making daily treks to an abandoned uranium mine and later returning to their habitats with armfuls of precious ore, which is harnessed to exponentially increase the deadliness of the rudimentary dirty bombs that they launch at rival troops using a homemade coconut tree catapult. This is something that would’ve never been possible before COVID-19 due to the constant threats of poaching and deforestation, making it all the more heartwarming to witness the gorillas gleefully shrieking as they watch their enemies disappear in enormous mushroom clouds. And though fallout from the blasts often kills thousands of animals besides the intended targets, one nonetheless gets the sense that this is nature at its most primal and pure, the way it once was before mankind came along.  Wow. How wonderful it is to see these magnificent, intelligent creatures living happy and carefree after centuries of hardship at the hands of man.  These beautiful animals are finally reaching their full potential, and all they needed was for humans to take a pause for once! The sight of gorilla heads and limbs flying through the jungle following the premature explosion of a simple bomb built out of bananas and other naturally occurring components is truly breathtaking, and here’s hoping that the blast craters these unholy weapons leave behind will serve as powerful reminders as to the beauty that is possible when man steps back and lets nature take its course."
"Man, Just Look It Up Later: This Guy Is Shazaming The Church Choir’s Rendition Of ‘Amazing Grace’ In The Middle Of His Grandmother’s Funeral",N/A,https://clickhole.com/man-just-look-it-up-later-this-guy-is-shazaming-the-church-choirs-rendition-of-amazing-grace-in-the-middle-of-his-grandmothers-funeral/,"We can all relate to the feeling of hearing a great song and needing to know what it is, like, RIGHT now, but this is definitely a bit much: This guy is Shazaming the choir’s rendition of “Amazing Grace” in the middle of his grandmother’s funeral. Ugh, buddy, please. This can wait. The second Salt Lake City claims processor Ryan Medfield heard the church choir sing the first note of “Amazing Grace” at his 86-year-old grandmother’s funeral, his eyes lit up as if he was hearing the hottest track he’d ever heard in his life. He immediately started bobbing his head and grooving to the melody, looking to those around him with an impressed look on his face and saying, “Yeah! Woo! Wow, who is this!?” After being ignored by the tearful mourners around him, he resorted to pulling out his iPhone, opening popular song identification app Shazam, and holding his phone high in the air above the heads of the other parishioners in an attempt to figure out what song he was enthusiastically rocking out to. After not immediately receiving a song match in the app, he moved quickly from his pew, pushing his way through the packed congregation in a mad dash to try to get a stronger LTE signal in the entryway to the Word of God church in Provo, Utah, where his beloved grandmother was being memorialized, before the hymn ended. While able to pick up a stronger signal in the church’s lobby, the app now struggled to find the song in its database due to Ryan’s distance from the choir. He then panicked and tried Googling whatever lyrics he could pick out, but his rush caused numerous typos which rendered the search futile, so he attempted to record a bit of the track to his phone’s “voice memos” folder so he could at least listen to a shitty sounding recording of it later. Dude, sure, it’s a great song, but honestly, not now. Come on, man. This is your own grandmother’s funeral for God’s sake. Just keep humming the melody until you have a chance to sneak off to the bathroom or something. Show some respect for your poor grandmother and put the phone away. You’ll have all the time in the world to figure out what song “Amazing Grace” is later."
Troubling Sign: A New Report Has Found That Millennials Are The First Generation To Make Fewer Disgusting Cottage Cheese-Based Meals Than Their Parents,N/A,https://clickhole.com/troubling-sign-a-new-report-has-found-that-millennials-are-the-first-generation-to-make-fewer-disgusting-cottage-cheese-based-meals-than-their-parents/,"The American dream promises that each generation will have a better life than the one that came before it, but for the latest generation to reach adulthood, it now seems that this upward trajectory may no longer be guaranteed: A new report has found that millennials are the first generation to make fewer disgusting cottage cheese based meals than their parents. Yikes. This is a seriously troubling sign.  The report, published last week by a team of sociologists at Stanford University, found that millennials are making 70 percent fewer meals that combine cottage cheese with ingredients like ranch dressing, cream of mushroom soup, or Jello packets than Baby Boomers did at their age, making them the first generation in modern history to have fewer opportunities to indulge in cottage cheese than their parents. Data shows that by age 40, the average Baby Boomer had experienced at least 65 separate cottage cheese recipes, ranging from simple breakfast dishes involving heaping scoops of cottage cheese with canned fruit to more elaborate holiday casseroles involving cottage cheese and ham, whereas Millennials are not only eating far fewer cottage cheese-based entrees, but also fewer sides where cottage cheese is inexplicably served with iceberg lettuce and pineapple rings.  “The statistical rule of thumb has always been that each new generation enjoys a greater wealth of cottage cheese dishes thanks to the sacrifices and labor of the generations prior, but for the first time since the Civil War, that trend is now moving downward due to a number of adverse factors,” explained the study’s lead researcher Sarah Yeo. “With an ever-decreasing number of church picnics to attend each summer, fewer 1950s cookbooks with names like “Simple Family Meals For The Dutiful Housewife” still in print, and fewer five-hour swaths of available free time to dedicate to crafting elaborate cottage cheese and Frito dishes with olives carefully arranged into a happy face on top, it’s just no longer realistic for young people to be able to expect to eat cottage cheese in some form two or three times a day like their parents.” “Sadly, for many Millennials, the only way for them to enjoy desserts that are basically just cottage cheese and Cool Whip mixed in Keebler ready-made crusts is to simply move back in with their parents,” she continued.    Yeo added that, cottage cheese-wise, not only do Millennials have it much worse than their parents, but they’ve also been saddled with the near-impossible task of salvaging an environment destroyed by the single-use aluminum containers that previous generations relied on to bring dishes like cottage cheese and Velveeta soup and cottage cheese crusted chicken piccata to potlucks.  This is deeply concerning. While Millennials often get a bad wrap as a spoiled generation, there’s certainly nothing entitled about being the first wave of Americans to ever be deprived of consistent access to generous portions of cottage cheese-based foods. It’s a devastating reality that for this generation, the childhood dream of sitting down at the end of a long day to enjoy a cottage cheese and Nilla Wafer parfait after cleaning up their Mexican cottage cheese lasagna dinner may never be realized.

Possibly Illegal: This Baby Is Being Pushed In A Stroller By A Different Baby,N/A,https://clickhole.com/possibly-illegal-this-baby-is-being-pushed-in-a-stroller-by-a-different-baby/,"Well, huh. The scene currently unfolding on a street in Richmond, VA is both incredibly confusing and potentially incriminating: This baby is being pushed in a stroller by a different baby.  Isn’t this sort of thing against the law? Shouldn’t someone be watching them? It’s not like the one pushing the stroller could possibly be responsible for the baby inside the stroller.  According to reports from the scene, for the last 20 minutes, a baby has been pushing another baby in a stroller down the sidewalk of a downtown Richmond street, and witnesses have been quick to clarify that the stroller is not a small, doll-sized carriage that a baby might conceivably own, but rather a full-size, convertible stroller with a bassinet and everything. There’s a real baby in there. The two babies are reportedly smiling and sharing cotton candy, and while their identities are currently unknown, witnesses guess that based on their dynamic, they are either siblings, friends, or cousins.  Very interesting. It’s not like you can just lock up a baby in prison, but this is probably against some kind of law. Somebody should probably arrest one of these babies. Or both of these babies. Apparently, the two babies have obeyed all traffic signs and have had no difficulty safely crossing the street, even while the baby doing the pushing threw up on himself while pretending to take a call on what onlookers believe was a real iPhone that no longer works. The babies have mainly stuck to the sidewalk, although they reportedly made one stop into a Starbucks where they approached the register, threw their empty cotton candy wrapper onto the counter, clapped three times, then left. To make things even more confusing, the baby in the stroller just climbed out and swapped places with the one doing the pushing, and apparently they now look even happier than before, because the baby who is now sitting in the stroller is laughing while the one pushing the stroller is doing a little jig. Weirder still, a child who witnesses describe as an incredibly large baby, much larger than the first two babies, just walked out of an alley and handed the babies another thing of cotton candy. Then the baby in the stroller got out, and now all three babies are pushing an empty stroller while sharing the cotton candy as they continue down the street.  Seriously, what’s going on? It definitely seems like someone is supposed to go to jail here. Would it be the guardians who should have been watching these babies? Or would it be the babies? Can babies even be tried in a juvenile court? And where the hell did they get cotton candy? There’s no carnival in town! This situation definitely need police intervention ASAP. God, we don’t even know where to begin. Here’s hoping that someone who knows the legality of this situation intervenes sometime soon, because this definitely seems like the kind of thing that should at least result in some kind of penalty. Babies pushing other babies in strollers…you’ve got to assume that kind of thing against some kind of law. Time for someone to go to prison!"
"Growing As An Artist: Richard Lewis Has Announced He Would Like To Be The Next Comedian To Make A Mediocre Dramedy Where He Has Weird, Grunting Sex In The First 5 Minutes",N/A,https://clickhole.com/growing-as-an-artist-richard-lewis-has-announced-he-would-like-to-be-the-next-comedian-to-make-a-mediocre-dramedy-where-he-has-weird-grunting-sex-in-the-first-5-minutes/,"Comedian Richard Lewis has been making rounds in the club circuit for decades, but it seems like the longtime comic is ready to take the next step in his career: Richard Lewis has announced he would like to be the next comedian to make a mediocre dramedy where he has weird, grunting sex in the first 5 minutes.  Awesome! Sounds like Richard Lewis is serious about expanding his artistic horizons. Earlier today, Richard Lewis uploaded a video to his Twitter account where he announced his wishes to follow in the footsteps of comedians who managed to level up their careers by starring in middling drama-comedies as characters who get naked and have jarring, loud sex in their first few minutes onscreen, such as Andy Samberg in Palm Springs, Pete Davidson in The King of Staten Island, and Paul Rust in Love. Check out a transcription of the Curb Your Enthusiasm star’s message for the entertainment industry below: “Richard Lewis here, and if you’re a Hollywood producer or director, then listen up, because I want to be the next vaguely famous comedian to star in a straight-to-streaming dramedy where, for pretty much no reason at all, my character has weird, grunting sex within the first 5 minutes of the movie. After years of standup comedy, I’m ready to prove myself as an artist and play a guy who the audience will meet during a scene where I’m thrusting haphazardly while making all kinds of deep, guttural sounds that are neither erotic nor funny in a movie that people will only watch because they’re hungover and it seems fine. It’s time that Richard Lewis gets to play a character who has off-putting, sweaty sex while standing up in like, a bar bathroom before the film’s opening titles have even rolled. I want to show the world that I’ve grown in my career and can do more than just comedy – I can also do a slightly funny, slightly dramatic 89-minute movie that opens with a shot of my nude, hairy back as I make awful grumbling noises through clenched teeth into the neck of a female character who’s probably a girlfriend I’ll break up with in act two. Hollywood, take note, because I am 100 percent ready to really grunt it out in an unnecessarily graphic sex scene even though the rest of the movie will have very little to do with me having sex, and my character could just have easily been introduced with a shot of me watching TV on the couch or something.” Richard Lewis concluded the video by making a minute’s worth of low, throat-clearing grunts to prove that he was capable of playing the role before signing off, saying, “Hollywood, let’s make this happen!” It’s always exciting when a comedian takes a big risk and transitions from stand-up or sketch into forgettable movies that kick off with an unnecessarily graphic sex scene that entertains nobody and reveals nothing about the character other than the fact that they kind of know how to fuck! Hopefully a Hollywood producer gets in touch with Richard Lewis soon so he can take this next big step in his career. Best of luck, Richard! We hope it happens for you!"
Total Chaos: Three Of The Seven Toothbrushes In This Bathroom Toothbrush Holder Are An Absolute Mystery To Everyone In The Family,N/A,https://clickhole.com/total-chaos-three-of-the-seven-toothbrushes-in-this-bathroom-toothbrush-holder-are-an-absolute-mystery-to-everyone-in-the-family/,"If there wasn’t already enough chaos going on in the world, here’s a story of yet another out-of-control situation that’s currently unfolding in a suburban home: three of the seven toothbrushes in this bathroom toothbrush holder are an absolute mystery to everyone in the family. Yikes. This is utter pandemonium.  With only five total people in the household, members of the Lipitz family in Bedford, Massachusetts, are truly at a loss as to how so many toothbrushes have managed to accumulate in their upstairs bathroom, especially considering that it’s really only the four kids who use this particular bathroom—the parents brush their teeth in the master bath. While it was initially suspected that some of the toothbrushes might’ve been left behind after a sleepover birthday party one of the family’s four children held a few weeks back, this theory now seems unlikely, as kids rarely brush their teeth at sleepovers, and even if they do, it’d be pretty weird for them to put their toothbrushes in another family’s toothbrush holder.    Another possibility is that one of the unexplained toothbrushes is simply a leftover relic of the days before the youngest Lipitz child got braces and switched to an electric toothbrush, or perhaps one of the toothbrushes might just be a freebie that someone brought home from the dentist and used for a couple days before realizing it sucked and moving onto a better one. After all, the bottle of Dr. Bronner’s that’s been sitting in the shower for years was clearly abandoned in favor of real soap for the same reason. There’s also a small chance that one of the toothbrushes might be the one that the mom uses to clean the grout in the shower, though it would be a pretty shocking move for her to keep it in the holder instead of under the sink with the other cleaning supplies since she’s usually so anal about germs. Hmm, this truly is a mystery. There are more questions than answers at this point.  Whatever the case, if the Lipitzes don’t figure out what’s going on with the toothbrush holder soon, they’d probably be best off just throwing out all of the toothbrushes and starting over with a clean slate. After all, a couple of the toothbrushes have visible layers of dust on them now, so it’s not like they’re being used. It’s time to put an end to this chaos and restore some order to the world."
"‘Fucking Take The Mannequins, Too’: Kohl’s Has Announced That They Don’t Give A Shit If You Loot Their Stores, They’ve Been Dying To Shut Down For Years At This Point",N/A,https://clickhole.com/fucking-take-the-mannequins-too-kohls-has-announced-that-they-dont-give-a-shit-if-you-loot-their-stores-theyve-been-dying-to-shut-down-for-years-at-this/,"Over the past few months, we’ve seen countless stories about retail establishments being looted amidst the civil unrest that’s gripping the nation, and while this has been devastating for many businesses, one major department store chain appears to be welcoming the destruction: Kohl’s just announced that they don’t give a fuck if you loot their stores, as they’ve been dying to shut down for years at this point. Damn. Sounds like Kohl’s is officially over it. Earlier today, Kohl’s revealed that they’ve been teetering on the brink of insolvency for years and, tired of fighting off the inevitable, they’re now essentially inviting looters to come help expedite their demise so that they can just get it over with and move on with their lives.  “While many businesses are boarding up windows to keep people from ransacking their stores, we at Kohl’s are actually encouraging any and all acts of theft and property damage at our locations, as things have been pretty rough on our end for a while now and we’re ready to be put out of our misery,” said the retailer in a press release, adding that, really, it’d probably be best for everyone if they stopped being a thing. “Honestly, there’s just no need for Kohl’s anymore, and that’s not gonna change no matter how many 40-percent-off coupons we put in the Sunday paper. No number of exclusive product collaborations with Fergie are gonna save this sinking ship. So if folks are angry and want to loot something, then they should by all means head down to their local Kohl’s and go nuts.” “Seriously, we won’t call the police or try to stop you or anything,” the retailer continued. “Smash the windows, raid the clothes racks. Bring a U-Haul and load it up with all the Lauren Conrad signature bedding and outdated Casio watches you want—we’ve got warehouses of that shit that we’re never gonna sell. Hell, even take the mannequins if you’re feeling it. It’s not like we’re gonna have any use for them when we shut down, which will hopefully be sooner than later. Loot your hearts out, motherfuckers.” Kohl’s went on to clarify that this isn’t meant to be any kind of statement about police brutality, adding that they “don’t give a fuck about politics or whatever” and are instead just profoundly tired of being Kohl’s and are at this point just counting down the days until they can file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and be done with it all for good.  Fair enough! Kudos to Kohl’s for having the courage to accept their fate, as well as for providing a safe outlet for looters to dispense their righteous anger and steal armfuls of discounted Vera Wang plus-size blouses. Might as well bow out gracefully now while they’ve still got their dignity.   "
"‘They Shouldn’t Be Entertained For More Than Five Minutes, Tops’: The American Psychological Association Has Announced That If Your Kid Goes A Little Too Buckwild Over Bubbles, Keep An Eye On That",N/A,https://clickhole.com/they-shouldnt-be-entertained-for-more-than-five-minutes-tops-the-american-psychological-association-has-announced-that-if-your-kid-goes-a-little-too-buckwild-over-bubbles/,"If you’re a parent, you may want to start paying more attention to what your kids are doing during playtime, as experts just issued a stern warning about a popular children’s activity: The American Psychological Association has announced that if your kid goes a little too buckwild over bubbles, then you’re definitely going to want to keep an eye on that.  Be on the lookout, parents! In a statement released earlier today, the American Psychological Association detailed growing concerns among mental health professionals over children who go just a bit too apeshit when you hand them a thing of bubbles, noting that something may be “profoundly wrong” with a child if they blow bubbles for a long time without growing bored and ditching them for a real toy. The organization explained that, while there’s certainly some novelty to blowing a bubble and watching it float around in the sky, ultimately bubbles are just bits of soap that become round somehow, and if a child spends an entire afternoon chasing them around the yard and giggling, that is a serious red flag. “There’s nothing inherently wrong with a child playing with bubbles, but kids should realize that they’re not meant for prolonged recreation, and they should really just be a thing that you play with, like, once or twice a year at summer barbecues or whatever. Bubbles definitely shouldn’t be part of the regular toy rotation,” said the APA in their statement, adding that bubbles should be “briefly amusing at best” considering that most kids these days have iPads that they could be playing with instead, which are an objectively superior entertainment option in literally every regard. “Like, if your kid gets to that point where the front of their shirt is soaking wet from flinging around the bubble wand, that’s way too much. If any of your grownup friends see that, they’re 100 percent gonna be talking on the way home like, ‘That kid was going apeshit over those bubbles…pretty weird.’ And they’ll be absolutely right, because it is weird.” “And don’t get us started on kids who run around all excited trying to pop the bubbles,” the statement continued. “If your kid loves popping bubbles, that means they’re a psychopath.” The APA went on to say that kids should experience diminishing returns when playing with bubbles, as you get the whole gist of them pretty much immediately, and after that it’s just the same fucking thing over and over again. Hence, the organization says that if your child remains stimulated by the bubbles for more than a few minutes and gets to that point where they’re wildly chasing the bubbles around and squealing and running into grownups’ legs, that is deeply troubling, and you should probably just give them some Benadryl and put them in bed at six o’clock so they’ll calm the fuck down.  Wow, this is definitely some important information that every parent should know! Even though the APA didn’t go so far as to recommend a bubble boycott, the concerns they raised are nonetheless alarming, and it’d probably be best if you have your child play with sparklers instead of bubbles from now on just to be safe. Or, if your child absolutely insists on playing with bubbles, perhaps consider loudly belittling them while they do so to help them realize that bubbles aren’t really all that interesting and are in fact actually pretty fucking stupid. You may feel uncomfortable doing it, but your kid will one day thank you for doing whatever was necessary to keep them from becoming a full-on freak or a serial killer or something. "
A Piece Of History: The Terrifying Clown Mask That Frightened JFK To Death When Jackie Kennedy Put It On As A Prank Is Coming To The Smithsonian,N/A,https://clickhole.com/a-piece-of-history-the-terrifying-clown-mask-that-frightened-jfk-to-death-when-jackie-kennedy-put-it-on-as-a-prank-is-coming-to-the-smithsonian/,"The tragic death of President John F. Kennedy remains one of the most shocking days in United States history, but now, for the first time in over 55 years, an incredible artifact from that fateful event will be put on display: The terrifying clown mask that frightened JFK to death when Jackie Kennedy put it on as a prank is coming to the Smithsonian. Earlier today, the National Museum Of American History announced a new exhibit that will feature the creepy rubber clown mask Jackie Kennedy Onassis wore on November 22nd, 1963, that tragically scared the 35th president to the point of cardiac arrest. The exhibit will take museum visitors moment by moment through the terrible day when Jackie O, bored after finishing up a game of tennis, found the mask in a dusty box labeled “HALLOWEEN STUFF,” put it over her head, and hid behind a couch in the Presidential Bedroom Suite, unwittingly setting one of our nation’s greatest tragedies in motion.  The heart-wrenching exhibit will include audio excerpts from interviews with Jackie Kennedy in which the former First Lady narrates the ill-fated prank, describing in devastating detail how, after she popped out from behind the couch and shouted “BOO!”, her husband immediately went wide-eyed with terror and evacuated his bowels, clutching his chest as he backed away from the grinning clown visage that would turn out to be the last thing he’d ever see. In the emotional clips, Jackie recounts the heart-wrenching moment when Kennedy, shaking with fear, croaked out “Dracula?” and then dropped slowly to the floor, whimpering “Oh god, he finally found me,” before fatally succumbing to the scare. Additionally, a video reenactment of the terrible event will allow viewers to experience the moment when Jackie ripped off the mask and rushed to her husband’s side. “Why have you taken the shape of my wife?!?” an actor playing Kennedy screams in anguish in the clip. “I just want to live!” The President then begs for help from God, yelling “Smite this creature!” while Jackie insists that it was just her under the mask, and that all she’d wanted to do was scare him a little. “You can’t fool me, deceiver!” Kennedy responds angrily. “Away, beast! Away!” The video then shows the President swatting meekly at his wife with both hands as he writhes on the carpet, his face growing paler and paler as death overtakes him.  At the conclusion of the exhibit, visitors will be able to check out never-before-seen photos of Jackie Kennedy sobbing as doctors wheel her deceased husband away on a dolly, his corpse pitifully stiffened in the fetal position, his mouth a ghastly rictus. Visitors will also get to see the original print of the unforgettable image of the First Lady still clutching the clown mask as she accompanies her husband’s casket on Air Force One, struggling to remain composed as Lyndon Johnson is administered the oath of office just feet away.  Incredible. It’s truly exciting that people can finally gaze upon this important American relic in person, and everyone should try to go see it if they can, as it may very well be the most consequential clown mask in the history of not only this country, but the world. This is something you don’t want to miss!"
The Future Of Biohacking: Elon Musk Has Announced He Is Now Half Machine After Gluing A Vitamix Blender To His Leg,N/A,https://clickhole.com/the-future-of-biohacking-elon-musk-has-announced-he-is-now-half-machine-after-gluing-a-vitamix-blender-to-his-leg/,"Buckle up, tech geeks, because we’re about to take the biggest jolt into the future the world has ever seen. One of the most forward-thinking, brilliant minds of our generation has shown once again why he is one of the major innovators of the 21st century: Tesla CEO Elon Musk has announced he is now half machine after gluing a Vitamix blender to his leg! Holy. Fucking. Shit. What a major milestone in the quest to technologically enhance the human body. Musk dropped this amazing tech bomb in a video call with stockholders this morning, where he announced that he had some important news that was going to revolutionize the future of not only his businesses, but all of humanity. Panning his webcam down to his leg, he revealed that he had cut one of his pant legs off and glued a Vitamix blender directly to his skin on the side of his calf. Cackling with pride, he then dropped 2 unpeeled oranges into the Vitamix and flipped the switch, and even though nothing happened because the blender was unplugged, it was still an incredible moment that proves that we are officially living in the future. “I am no longer a man!” Musk shouted as he jolted up to plug the blender in and tripped over the cord. “I have become a machine! My blaster is permanently fused to my body. We have become one!” Musk then managed to plug the blender in and switch it on again, which immediately launched both oranges into the air with a mist of juice due to the blender’s cover not being on. “I no longer need sleep! My leg can now perform thousands of calculations per second!” Musk beamed before making a string of beeps and motor sounds with his mouth. While Musk’s body is clearly still not fully integrated with his new cybernetic limb, the Tesla CEO explained that he believes that by adding a few more squirts of glue and pushing the blender onto his leg even harder, his melding of man and machine will be complete. If you thought the old Elon Musk was a visionary, just wait until you see what he can do now that he’s officially a cyborg. Yep, today will forever be remembered as the day human evolution entered a bold new era thanks to one visionary scientist. Technology is always advancing at a steady pace, but it’s rare we see a major innovation that will clearly usher in a new era like this. Up until Musk glued a premium small appliance to himself with a stunning amount of glue, biohacking was merely the stuff of dark science fiction. But this marks the first time that machinery has successfully been integrated so seamlessly with a living, breathing human being so, moral implications aside, this is a huge step forward for the human race. We can’t wait to see what Elon Musk the cyborg is able to accomplish now that his organic body has been fused with a powerful blender!"
Buckle The Fuck Up: Scientists Have Announced They’re Going To Save Up All Their New Discoveries And Then—BOOM!—Drop Them All At Once In 15 Years,N/A,https://clickhole.com/buckle-the-fuck-up-scientists-have-announced-theyre-going-to-save-up-all-their-new-discoveries-and-then-boom-drop-them-all-at-once-in-15-years/,"Science nuts, hold onto your fucking hats. Scientists around the world have announced some completely huge news: from now on, instead of announcing their latest discoveries periodically as they happen, they’re going to let all of them build up over the course of fifteen years and then—BOOM—unleash them on us all at once. Whoa. Prepare yourselves to be absolutely goddamned floored in 15 years! At a press conference this morning, a spokeswoman for a coalition representing all of the world’s universities, private labs, and independent researchers announced their plan to really hit everyone over the fucking head with 15 years’ worth of data all at once in 2035. “From minor discoveries, such as finding a new species of slugs, to major ones, like successfully cloning a wooly mammoth, we have agreed to keep all new scientific developments completely secret from the public until exactly 15 years from today’s date. At that point, we will unleash a massive torrent of mind-blowing discoveries in a single paper that’s guaranteed to knock you flat on your motherfucking ass.” While the spokeswoman acknowledged that announcing scientific breakthroughs as they happen instead of waiting 15 years could save an estimated 500 million lives, prevent the extinction of countless animal species, and significantly mitigate the consequences of global warming, scientists have agreed that it is the only way to really fucking floor everyone with science. Harvard physicist Alena Gorman explained the reasoning behind the plan. “Scientists have been trying to knock everyone’s fucking socks off with newly-discovered facts, technological breakthroughs, and medical advancements for centuries, yet no one ever really seems to give a shit. Our models show that building all of our discoveries up for 15 years and then—BAM—opening the floodgates all at once is the only way to truly skullfuck the whole planet with a massive avalanche of science.” The current plan is for all scientists to keep their discoveries completely secret, even from one another, until exactly 15 years from today. At that time, they will host a massive event at Ohio Stadium that will be simulcast live to every country in the world. Over the course of the uninterrupted 12-day event, scientists will take the stage to reveal their discoveries in order of importance while Metallica performs in the background and over one billion dollars worth of fireworks explode overhead. The most amazing discovery, likely something to do with aliens or curing cancer, will be revealed last by a gigantic 400-foot-tall hologram of Albert Einstein at a volume of an ear-crushing 189 decibels. Damn! This is going to be fucking intense. We can’t wait! The next 15 years are going to be tough for science fanatics, but the incredible rush of having all of those built-up discoveries unleashed like a volcanic explosion is going to be one of the most incredible moments of our lifetimes. Until then, we’ll just have to sit tight and be patient until the deluge of science comes to drown us all in 2035."
Nerves Of Steel: This Guy Is Scarfing Down The Trader Joe’s Free Samples Without Even Doing That Pretend Curious Glance At The Product’s Box,N/A,https://clickhole.com/nerves-of-steel-this-guy-is-scarfing-down-the-trader-joes-free-samples-without-even-doing-that-pretend-curious-glance-at-the-products-box/,"Goddamn. If you’re in Chicago, stop what you’re doing and head to the Trader Joe’s on Clybourn because there’s an impressive display of confidence going down that will absolutely blow your mind: This guy is scarfing down the free samples without even doing that pretend curious glance at the product’s box. Whoa. Dude’s got nerves of steel! Much to the awe of his fellow shoppers, 28-year-old Brad Norman has been boldly stationed at the Trader Joe’s free sample table for a good several minutes now, brazenly scarfing down nearly half a tray of the complimentary mac and cheese bites without even pretending to be interested in buying the product. While most shoppers would at the very least humor the employee handing out the samples with half-assed questions like, “Mmm, what’s in these?” or “So is there a sale going on with these right now?” Brad hasn’t even bothered making eye contact with her, completely ignoring her spiel about how quick and easy the bites are to prepare while he continues to stuff the samples down his gullet with icy disregard towards the established Trader Joe’s norms. Even when the employee tried to explain to Brad that there were seven different kinds of cheese in the bites, he couldn’t even be bothered to grunt out a polite “Oh, yum!” or “You can never have enough cheese!” to make it seem like he’s actually considering buying a box for himself. Nope, he’s instead making it unmistakably clear that he is a man of no shame who is only there to take advantage of free food, and he knows that no one will stop him because he is technically not breaking any rules. He knows that the customer is indeed always right, even if what they’re doing feels so, so wrong.  Wow. This guy’s got some seriously huge cojones.  At press time, Brad had just succeeded in depleting the entire tray of samples, and sources say that he is now walking around the store while keeping an eye on the sample table, presumably so that he can swoop in and continue indulging himself as soon as the mac and cheese bites are replenished. Goddamn, if this is how the guy behaves with just a single free sample table, imagine what kind of damage he could do in a freebie wonderland like Costco—he could eat his entire body weight in a single lap around the store! While we can’t say we respect Brad and his borderline sociopathic grocery store behavior, we are admittedly very, very impressed."
Feminism Win: There’s Probably A New Women’s Lifestyle Website Called Like ‘Whores’ Where You Can Learn About Face Creams Or Ghosting Or Whatever,N/A,https://clickhole.com/feminism-win-theres-probably-a-new-womens-lifestyle-website-called-like-whores-where-you-can-learn-about-face-creams-or-ghosting-or-whatever/,"Alright ladies, it’s time to get excited, because we’ve got some awesome news that’s going to completely shake up the way you use the internet: there’s probably a new women’s lifestyle website called, like, “Whores” where you can learn about face creams or ghosting or whatever. Hell fucking yes!  If you’re looking for a major feminist win today, look no further, because there’s a good chance that when you Google something like, “actually comfortable leggings,” or “why didn’t he respond to my text,” the first result will be a brand new women’s interest site that is apparently popular and possibly reputable! The site, which probably has a tagline like “finally, a feminist answer to sexist media,” is maybe named something like “Whores” or “Sluts,” but with a domain name like “the-whoresblog.com” or “sloots.biz” since the normal spellings were already taken by porn sites! And if this epic new ladies’ website hasn’t named itself after a historically offensive word for a woman in an attempt to reclaim the term, then it’s probably some cutesy word like “Thimble,” though it’ll almost definitely be spelled “Thymble” for no apparent reason! So amazing! There’s got to be something about this website’s whole deal that’s empowering in some way! In all likelihood, the website’s homepage is full of articles on all sorts of feminist stuff, like switching to a Diva Cup, being bisexual, loving your body despite weight gain, doing your makeup (with long preface about how no one needs to wear makeup), being bisexual with a chronic illness, and making DIY face masks that use like, avocado or chia seeds or some shit like that. And even better, all of these articles are likely part of some theme week called like, “The Be Your Best You Challenge” or “The-WhoresBlog.com’s Body Positivity Pledge!” You can expect dozens of new posts on the site each day, but most of them will be no more than 350 words, making it unclear whether the whole thing is run by like, six freelancers or a huge, full-time writing staff of accomplished journalists! The site’s color scheme is almost certainly millennial pink!! If you’re a woman, you’re probably jumping for joy thinking about how this new site must have recently published some long form piece called “In Defense Of The Bad Boy” or whatever, where someone wrote like 10,000 words about toxic masculinity or the patriarchy or that kinda thing —though in the end, it’s mostly just a brag about how all of the author’s relationships were with men who owned motorcycles. And right below that journalistic bombshell, there’s probably also a list called like, “The 40 Best Vibrators To Buy Right Now,” and whoever wrote the list will spare no detail while explaining how she tested all of them herself! The vibrator listicle is probably somehow sponsored content for Lady Speed Stick deodorant! Forty vibrators is an awesome and normal amount of vibrators to own! If you scroll down the site far enough, you’ll almost definitely come across an article about sexual assault allegations against a pop punk band you’ve never heard of from New Jersey (or a place that might as well be New Jersey.) It won’t really be clear whether or not the piece was well-reported, but it’s all water under the bridge at this point because by now the band’s lead guitarist probably either wrote a Notes App apology that the site called “a perfect example for other men on how to apologize” or just straight up shot himself in the head! Wow. This is so awesome! Feminists, if you’ve ever wanted to read a shockingly long article about what it means when he likes your Instagram post, or watch a video about like, how to put a fitted sheet on a bed by yourself, there’s now probably another website where you can do just that! Being a woman in the world is a complex and sometimes difficult endeavor, but thankfully, some site called Whores or Sluts or Bitch Brigade or whatever the fuck has almost definitely come on the scene this week to guide you through with a vast array of content about essential oil diffusers and salary negotiations and swiss chard and whatnot! We are so here for it! This is our new favorite website ever!"

Oof. Not a good look, Talbots. It’s unclear what specifically provoked the fashion brand to go off, but given the tone of the tweets they sent, they are obviously extremely angry. See for yourself:  Wow.  We’re trying our best to sympathize with Talbots here, but you have to think there’s a better way for them to drum up new business than cussing out strangers on Twitter. Just chill out, Talbots. Your day will come, don’t worry."
Who The Fuck Did He Think He Was Playing? Kelsey Grammer Just Issued A Tearful Apology Saying That As A White Man He Never Should Have Accepted The Role Of Frasier,N/A,https://clickhole.com/who-the-fuck-did-he-think-he-was-playing-kelsey-grammer-just-issued-a-tearful-apology-saying-that-as-a-white-man-he-never-should-have-accepted-the-role-of-frasier/,"More and more entertainers are taking the time to reckon with their past transgressions and come forward to admit to the harm they caused by playing racially problematic roles, but we can’t say we understand what exactly this actor is apologizing for: Kelsey Grammer just issued a tearful apology saying that, as a white man, he never should have accepted the role of Frasier. Huh. Who exactly did he think Frasier was supposed to be? Frasier is just a nerdy psychiatrist who lives in Seattle. It seems like you were fine to do it, Kelsey. Earlier today, the star of the NBC sitcom Frasier made an announcement from his Malibu home to apologize for taking the role: “In 1984, I made the decision to accept the part of Frasier Crane on Cheers. It became the defining role of my career, but as a white man, Frasier’s story was never mine to tell. When I first auditioned for the role, I had suspicions that I’d never be capable of understanding what it was really like to be Frasier, but I told myself it was okay, because as an actor, it’s my duty to play any character, regardless of my race. However, I now understand that it was my privilege, and the benefits I get from our white supremacist culture, that allowed me to believe I could ever accurately portray the experience of being Frasier.” Hmm. Does he mean that he didn’t study psychiatry like Frasier did? If so, that’s all good, Kelsey. Pretending to know about something like that is pretty standard acting stuff. Kelsey Grammer began to get choked up as he continued his message: “I had time to correct the situation when Cheers spun-off into Frasier’s own show, Frasier, but I did what was easy – not what was right – and I kept playing the part, even though this would have been a great opportunity for me to relinquish the role to someone who truly understood what it was like to exist in the world as Frasier Crane. I know I can never undo the pain I caused by playing Frasier, but what I can do is pledge to be a better ally from here on out. That’s why I’m calling on NBC to cease all syndication of Cheers and Frasier, and I’m asking that, in the event of a reboot, NBC make the right choice and cast an actor who actually knows what it means to be Frasier so that audiences are able to see the representation they deserve.” Not sure who he thought he was playing all those years, but it seems like he’s definitely sorry for it. Can’t say we know exactly what you’re apologizing for with this one, but we hope you find peace soon, Kelsey."
Good Fucking Riddance To Nature’s Ultimate Bitch: Eastern Painted Turtle Population Numbers Have Decreased 3 Percent Since 1955,N/A,https://clickhole.com/good-fucking-riddance-to-natures-ultimate-bitch-eastern-painted-turtle-population-numbers-have-decreased-3-percent-since-1955/,"Sometimes it can feel like there isn’t any justice in this world, but here’s a story that proves that you ultimately can’t outrun karma—especially if you’re one of the slowest piece-of-shit creatures in existence: According to researchers, eastern painted turtle populations have decreased three percent since 1955.  Yes! Seeing these bitch-ass turtles finally getting their comeuppance is giving us life! Everyone knows the eastern painted turtle is the most bullshit, pointless species in the animal kingdom, seeing how they’re basically just sentient rocks that for millions of years have just loafed around getting fat off the land while contributing jack-fucking-shit to the world around them. Thankfully, there’s now hard evidence that these green dumbfucks are simply too shitty to hack it in the wild, with their numbers currently dwindling at such a dramatic pace that their whole miserable species could be squealing in the fires of Hell by the end of this millennium. These wet morons and their dead-eyed spawn have long been making their homes primarily in swamps on the East coast of the United States, but instead of sacking up and adapting to their changing environment like normal, respectable animals do, the eastern painted turtles have stupidly opted to just retreat into their shells like cowards and do nothing while getting cucked by their ecosystem on the daily, leaving them pitifully vulnerable to raccoon predation and other natural hazards.   Indeed, natural selection clearly took one look at the eastern painted turtle and said “No, thanks,” and now these little bitches are all but begging for humans to come bail them out with a conservation project. But guess what, turtles? Humans aren’t going to do jackshit for you. If we’re gonna save an animal, it’s going to be an animal that’s actually useful and doesn’t just spend all its days lazily squirming around on its belly. Like a lion, for instance. If eastern painted turtles want any help, they’ll need to get it from monkeys or dogs or something, because mankind wants nothing to do with their sorry asses. Bye, bitches! Don’t let the door hit you on the way out! It seems like it’s only a matter of time before the eastern painted turtle fucks off for good, and we, for one, could not be happier. Sorry not sorry, you semi-spherical fucks! Next time read up on some Darwin and try not to act like you belong in a trash can, and then maybe things will work out better for you. Peace, losers!"
Seafood Lovers Rejoice! Long John Silver’s Has Announced They’re Going To Start Fishing Reaallll Deep In The Ocean Where All The Super Fucked-Up Shit Lives,N/A,https://clickhole.com/seafood-lovers-rejoice-long-john-silvers-has-announced-theyre-going-to-start-fishing-reaallll-deep-in-the-ocean-where-all-the-super-fucked-up-shit-lives/,"Better grab yourself a drool bib, seafood lovers, because something pretty tasty-sounding is coming to one of America’s most beloved fast food chains: Long John Silver’s has announced that they’re going to begin offering fish from reaaallll deep in the ocean where all of the super fucked-up shit lives. Yum!  In a press release put out earlier today, the seafood chain revealed plans to begin deep-frying whatever freaky creatures they can trawl up from the eerie abyss of the ocean floor, which is definitely exciting news for anyone who’s ever dreamed of dunking one of those fish with flashlight bulbs dangling off their heads in a little cup of tartar sauce. As the pandemic continues to pummel the restaurant industry, Long John Silver’s is hoping to recover some lost business by offering an eclectic array of menu items that can’t usually be obtained through a drive-thru window, whether it’s bioluminescent octopi with telescopic arms, eyeless ballooning exoskeletons with menacing fangs, translucent giant squid with thousands of squirming mandibles, or any other nightmarish alienoids that lurk among the lightless chasms of the Pacific’s deepest, most inhospitable trenches.  “At Long John Silver’s, we’re going where no man has ever gone to bring you new depths of flavor,” said the press release. “Introducing our Morsels Of The Deep menu, where you can find all of the deep-sea’s gooey, shape-shifting monstrosities fried golden brown and served with a piping-hot side of hush puppies. We’re traveling seven miles below sea level to bring you bites unlike anything you’ve tasted before, serving up quivering, many-tentacled delicacies for the whole family. If you’ve ever read an HP Lovecraft story and thought, I’d love to put some of these fucked-up monsters inside my mouth, then you’ll want to hurry down to Long John Silver’s and sink your teeth into these limited-time menu offerings!” The company also launched a commercial spot touting the new menu in which a husband and wife drift through the Mariana Trench in a deep-sea submersible and notice a curious strobing light in the distance, which, as they cautiously approach, reveals itself to be a massive, pulsing jelly creature covered in jagged barbs. “What is that thing?” the wife cries in terror, to which the husband simply replies, “Lunch!” The organism then shrieks and recoils from the submersible’s headlights before exploding into a great phosphorescent cloud of slime and teeth, at which point the husband and wife both exclaim “Mmmm mmm!” before a narrator chimes in announcing that fish like these are now available at Long John Silver’s. Wow! We’re getting hungry just thinking about it! It’s awesome to see a company boldly going where the incredibly fucked-up shit that basically makes you throw up the second you see it lives to satisfy the cravings of seafood fans everywhere. Who knows what great new otherworldly flavors will be discovered as Long John Silver’s mines the succulence from the unexplored depths of our planet’s final frontier and sells it in combo meals with hush puppies and coleslaw for $7.99? We can’t wait to find out!"
Making Progress: The Nation’s Coronavirus Researchers Have Finally Finished Their Definitive Rankings Of All The R.E.M. Albums And Now They’re Ready To Start Developing A COVID Vaccine,N/A,https://clickhole.com/making-progress-the-nations-coronavirus-researchers-have-finally-finished-their-definitive-rankings-of-all-the-r-e-m-albums-and-now-theyre-ready-to-start-developing-a-covid-vaccine/,"People around the world are praying for an end to the coronavirus pandemic, and at this point, a vaccine appears to be our only hope. Thankfully, a major announcement was made today that makes the possibility of a vaccine much more likely: The nation’s coronavirus researchers have completed their definitive rankings of all of the R.E.M. albums and can now finally start focusing their energy on bringing a vaccine to market. Amazing! It’s about time they got started on this. If the spirited debate and intense research that the nation’s hardworking virologists, chemists, and physicians put into ranking R.E.M. albums over the past 7 months is any indication, this virus better be prepared to get its ass kicked. There’s no doubt that since these experts have settled their differences on exactly where R.E.M.’s 2004 Around the Sun should fall in their rankings of R.E.M.’s entire studio LP discography, they’re ready to roll up their sleeves and go full-bore at destroying this virus for good. “Do I personally agree with putting Document in the number 4 position? No,” said Dr. Anthony Fauci. “But when you have thousands of virologists and biologists and chemists and all of these people with different specialties coming together to rank all 15 of R.E.M.’s studio albums, you’re going to find some differences in opinion. The important thing here is that we were able to work together over the past nine months to get a solid ranking that we could publish on our rateyourmusic.com page and now we can move on to fighting back against this horrible disease through the development of a vaccine.” Thank God. Hope has finally arrived! While this announcement means there is an end in sight, don’t get your hopes up that a vaccine will be available anytime soon. It took the nation’s coronavirus researchers many months just to rank all 15 albums from the alt-rock pioneers, including a four-month argument over whether 1983’s Murmur or 1992’s Automatic For The People deserved the top spot (they eventually chose Murmur), so it’s important to remember that good science takes time. But the fact that every coronavirus researcher out there just switched gears from evaluating the entirety of R.E.M.’s studio output to developing a coronavirus vaccine is still reason to jump for joy. We can’t to see what these amazing researchers will accomplish now that they’re getting started on developing a COVID vaccine! Medical progress FTW!"
Absolutely Heartbreaking: Your Boss Seems To Think That Your Company Is Important,N/A,https://clickhole.com/absolutely-heartbreaking-your-boss-seems-to-think-that-your-company-is-important/,"Aw jeez. Brace yourself, because the following story is definitely going to bum you out: your boss seems to think that your company is important. God, that’s about as sad as it gets. Even though you literally just work at a digital marketing firm, not a hospital or revolutionary tech company that’s trying to end child hunger or whatever, your boss is constantly giving speeches about how you’re “changing the world” and “creating a better future,” when in reality your company is an objectively unnecessary business that serves as a middleman between companies that buy ad placements and websites that display those ads. Your boss—a 42-year-old senior marketing strategist who describes himself in his Twitter bio as “Innovator. Futurist. Marketing wiz. Ally.”—keeps a framed Bill Gates quote on his desk that reads, “To win big you have to take big risks,” which is especially depressing considering that the biggest risk that could possibly be taken at your company would be, like, telling a slightly high profile client like Sherwin-Williams that they should consider investing more in their social presence or something.  Seriously, your company could stop existing tomorrow and it literally would not matter in any way. Nonetheless, your boss still seems to think that your company has the potential to be a force for good in the world, so much so that he makes the whole office come to a pointless hour-long “Think/Sync” meeting every Wednesday where he tries to get everyone stoked about being at work and asks people to “ideate” on new ways the company can “spread its mission,” which basically just means get more clients. He also attempts to inspire the “tribe,” as he collectively refers to everyone, with hollow corporate maxims that he comes up with and later hangs up in the kitchen, like “integrity is integral” and “every achievement starts as a dream,” genuinely believing that such wack bullshit will motivate grown-ass adults to try harder at their $45,000-a-year jobs. His earnestness in these meetings is truly, deeply heartbreaking.  You’ve really got to feel for this guy, who clearly doesn’t grasp the fact that, beyond employing 30 people who could pretty easily find another gig if this one went under, this company does not “play an essential role in the community” like he’s always saying it does, nor do its employees constitute the “best team in the whole damn world” like he so proudly exclaims in emails, as if he’s the starting point guard on the ‘96 Bulls. The reality is that the only people who work at the company are people who weren’t good enough to get jobs at cool places, and the only thing that the company actually contributes to society is annoying digital ads that people ignore while shopping online. Perhaps what’s most pitiful, though, is that your boss still gets giddy whenever he gets to talk to your company’s CEO, straight-up treating him like a celebrity despite the fact that he’s just some run-of-the-mill middle-aged guy who would gladly sell the business to the first available buyer. When he gets out of his monthly meetings with the CEO, he always brings back new marching orders like they’re edicts from God on stone tablets, presenting them to the rest of the staff with more zeal than should be possible for someone who’s literally just saying shit like “don’t be afraid to cold-call clients since they’re probably all planning their budgets for Q1 right now.” Poor guy. He really cares about this shit with all his heart, and that is a tragedy. Here’s hoping your boss comes to his senses and realizes that nothing your company does matters before he wastes too much more of his life. If he were to put this much passion and enthusiasm into just about anything else, he could honestly probably leave a meaningful mark on the world—although, to be clear, we’re not really holding our breath on that one."
Heartbreaking: The Plagues Of Egypt Have Been Sent Upon Dr. Ruth,N/A,https://clickhole.com/heartbreaking-the-plagues-of-egypt-have-been-sent-upon-dr-ruth/,"Uh oh. Something truly devastating is happening to one of America’s most beloved television personalities, and sadly it doesn’t seem like there’s anything we can do to help: the Plagues of Egypt have been sent upon Dr. Ruth. Just heartbreaking. According to sources, the Lord inexplicably began delivering his wrath upon Dr. Ruth earlier today, when the famed sex therapist turned on her shower and a torrent of blood began spraying out instead of water, drenching her head-to-toe. Covered in blood and running late for a radio appearance,  the frightened 92-year-old hurried around her apartment looking for clean water to wash herself off only to discover that blood was coming from all the faucets, leaving her with no choice but to wash herself off with a few cans of Sprite. She then rushed out of her apartment to get to her appointment but was suddenly chased back inside by a horrifying surge of thousands of screaming frogs, forcing her to retreat to her bedroom, which she was terrified to discover had become filled with a dense, suffocating cloud of gnats and lice that immediately swarmed all over every inch of her body.  “Plagues! Plagues!” she shrieked as she desperately rolled around on the floor in a futile attempt to keep the insects from cascading into her mouth and nose. “Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Ohhh, no, no, no, no, no. Please, God, make it stop! Aghhhh! Aghhhhhhh! Bitte hilf mir, Gott!” As she was rolling on the floor, a thunderous voice that could only belong to the Lord Most High suddenly bellowed down from the Heavens and shattered all the windows in the apartment, saying, “LET MY PEOPLE GO,” which greatly confused Dr. Ruth, as she did not have any slaves. When she tearfully tried to explain this to God, the Almighty did not seem to listen, as He then declared that for so long as her heart remained hardened, He would continue to bring His wrath down upon her home and livestock. Seconds later, His voice suddenly went silent, and Dr. Ruth looked up just in time to see her dear pet Yorkie collapsed to the carpet and die, at which point a frenzied pack of jackals and flies swarmed the dog’s corpse and rapidly devoured it.   So sad! While it’s still unclear why all this is happening to Dr. Ruth, sources say that the iconic TV and radio host is now scrambling to do whatever she can to ward off God’s fury, including smearing lamb’s blood on her doorway and denouncing her Jewish faith to convert to Christianity. Unfortunately, none of this seems to be helping, as just last hour every bit of her 4’ 7” body broke out in incredibly painful boils, forcing her to cancel a cover shoot for Ladies Home Journal that she’d been looking forward to for months.    God, poor Dr. Ruth. At press time, a great weeping and gnashing of teeth could reportedly be heard coming from Dr. Ruth’s apartment as a biblical storm of hail and fire had begun battering the roof of her building, damaging it beyond repair. And if the Book of Exodus is any indication, it’s likely that Dr. Ruth will soon see a plague of locusts and perhaps even the death of her son, the latter of which is a possibility that has her especially concerned. Tragically, it seems that her decades of sex expertise are basically useless in terms of quelling God’s anger, and there’s probably nothing she can do at this point to stop God from finishing delivering His judgement. Hang in there, Dr. Ruth! America loves you!"
Writers Take Note: The AP Stylebook Has Determined That The Word ‘DUMP’ Should Always Be Written In All Caps And Shouted In A Deep Voice When Read Aloud,N/A,https://clickhole.com/writers-take-note-the-ap-stylebook-has-determined-that-the-word-dump-should-always-be-written-in-all-caps-and-shouted-in-a-deep-voice-when-read-aloud/,"The undisputed authority on all things grammar has announced yet another big update that writers should definitely be aware of going forward: The AP Stylebook has determined that the word “DUMP” should always be written in all capital letters and shouted in a deep voice when read aloud. Take note, journalists! This is the new standard. This change is just the latest in a flurry of grammatical updates from the AP Stylebook, and it’s one that they say is the result of intense research on the etymological origins and evolving usage of the word “DUMP.” The esteemed organization revealed the new stylistic convention on their Facebook yesterday, providing several useful examples to illustrate the right and wrong ways to use the word “DUMP.”  Of course, certain publications that use their own style guide are not necessarily going to adopt this change. The ever-idiosyncratic New Yorker, for instance, will continue to spell the word as “düMp” with a capital “M” and an umlaut over the “u.” However, unless you’re one of the fancy, hoity-toity writers for The New Yorker, you’re fine just spelling “DUMP” like the rest of us. It’s fascinating how language can grow and evolve over time! Sometimes, it feels like the AP Stylebook wants to DUMP” a thousand changes on us every day, but it’s kind of cool that English is such an adaptable language. While this new standard for “DUMP” might take some getting used to, it’s sure to make our language more clear and precise going forward."
Teens Rejoice! Pat Sajak’s Head Is Floating Through Times Square Spitting On People!,N/A,https://clickhole.com/teens-rejoice-pat-sajaks-head-is-floating-through-times-square-spitting-on-people/,"Get excited, Gen Z kids, because one of the coolest things imaginable is going down in New York City right now, and thousands of teens are showing up to check it out: Pat Sajak’s head is currently floating through Times Square spitting on people! OMFG. Best. Day. Ever.  The Wheel Of Fortune host’s disembodied head arrived in Times Square earlier today and immediately started hocking loogies on people’s faces and shoes. Word that Sajak’s flying head was indiscriminately spitting on passersby spread quickly, and in just a short few hours thousands upon thousands of teens have packed into Manhattan to take in the scene, at times practically climbing over one another in hopes of catching a glimpse of the gameshow host’s head careening wildly between buildings and yelling.  Witnesses say that Sajak’s head has been zooming around roughly five feet off the ground while urgently shouting about how “Wheel Of Fortune was invented in Pompeii right as the volcano was erupting” and how he dreams every single detail about every episode of Wheel Of Fortune the night before he films them. The head has also been spotted periodically swooping down to lucky individuals and whispering “Vanna White and the Wheel are the same person” before spitting in their hair and rocketing back up into the sky.  And if that weren’t already reason enough to get every teen in America stampeding towards New York, it is now being reported that every single digital billboard in Times Square has suddenly started broadcasting footage of Sajak’s headless body frantically running around in search of its head. The body, which appears to be locked in an underground bunker of some kind, is clearly greatly distressed, clawing desperately at the walls and beating its chest like a gorilla. Witnesses say that Sajak’s floating head has been loudly referring to its headless body as “my pet dog” and angrily spitting at the images of it broadcasting on the billboards, the sight of which has provoked utter hysteria among the crowds of teens, whose enthusiasm for watching Sajak’s headless body futilely attempt to escape its subterranean prison is almost Beatlemania-like in intensity.  So awesome! Seriously, teens, get to Times Square RIGHT NOW so you don’t miss out on this once-in-a-lifetime spectacle. Sajak’s head just spit on a boy and called him a bruja, which is the Spanish word for witch! The head is spitting on literally everyone who gets near it, but you gotta figure it’s only a matter of time before it runs out of spit and decides to float away into the clouds, never to return. So hurry! You don’t want to be the only kid in your school who doesn’t get spit on by the disembodied head of a television icon. "

But just think about it: If DSW were going to have a free shoes deal, then there’s a very high chance that “FREESHOES” would be the promo code they’d use. While it’s true that they’re not currently advertising any kind of promotion involving free shoes, that doesn’t mean that one doesn’t exist. Maybe the code “FREESHOES” does in fact work, but they’re just not publicizing it because they’re worried too many people would find out and they’d have to give away more free shoes than they can afford. We wouldn’t be surprised if that was the situation. Of course, there’s always a chance that “FREESHOES” might not actually work, and if that’s the case, then you can just keep trying out a bunch of different promo codes until you find a winner. At the very least, you can probably score some pretty significant markdowns if you try things like “SHOE75” or “HALFOFFSHOES” or other similar variations. After five or six tries you’re bound to get a hit. But if for whatever reason you don’t, no worries!

Public Safety Win: Pennsylvania Will Open Schools For One Day In September So Everyone Can See Which Students Got Hot Over The Summer Before Returning To Online Learning,N/A,https://clickhole.com/public-safety-win-pennsylvania-will-open-schools-for-one-day-in-september-so-everyone-can-see-which-students-got-hot-over-the-summer-before-returning-to-online-learning/,"With the start of the school year quickly approaching, many states are still struggling to find a smart and safe way to reopen schools amid the COVID-19 pandemic, but one state just unveiled a new reopening plan that seems like a pretty great solution: Pennsylvania has announced that public schools will open for one day in September so everyone can see which students got hot over the summer and then after that return to online learning. Take note, other states, because THIS is the way to do it! PA Governor Tom Wolf announced his proposal for the state’s schools in a press conference earlier today, citing the need for a plan that both limits potential respiratory transmission of the coronavirus as much as possible and allows students see for themselves which of their peers went through a major growth spurt during the summer months and look like a totally new, super-hot person. “Although remote learning lets us safely continue classes despite the ongoing pandemic, a virtual classroom makes it virtually impossible to accurately identify which students have morphed from total loser to bangable hottie,” said Wolf, adding that while video technology lets you see people’s faces, you can’t take in the whole package. “You really need to see someone in person to take in how attractive they got since you saw them last, so by allowing students to go to school for just one day, we will be giving them the opportunity to check out whose skin cleared up, who developed a jawline, or who started filling out their bra.” “The physical changes a student might experience from June to August can drastically affect their popularity and social ranking, so it’s essential that our students have the chance to get a good look at how the summer treated everybody before they return to Zoom classes,” he continued. Wolf also announced that as an additional safety measure, students will be required to wear masks for the entire in-person school day with the exception of the lunch period, where they’ll be permitted to dramatically pull their masks off as they walk down the center of the cafeteria so that everyone can stare in awe at their transformation.  This plan is being praised by epidemiologists who’ve cited how important it is to limit exposure between students while noting how the impressions made on the first day of school can majorly influence who’ll sit at the cool lunch tables and get invited to parties, as well as who you crush on for the entire year—if not longer. Just awesome! Here’s hoping other states follow in Pennsylvania’s footsteps, because this sounds like an incredibly sensible plan for how schools should operate during the pandemic. "
"Sorry To Hear That, Billy: Billy Joel Has Revealed That That 2Pac Hologram Walked Inside Him A Few Years Back And Has Been Using His Body As A Host Ever Since",N/A,https://clickhole.com/sorry-to-hear-that-billy-billy-joel-has-revealed-that-that-2pac-hologram-walked-inside-him-a-few-years-back-and-has-been-using-his-body-as-a-host-ever-since/,"Uh oh. Looks like one of America’s most popular living musicians is facing a rather unfortunate situation that may very well spell the end of his storied career: Billy Joel has revealed that that 2Pac hologram walked inside him a few years back and has been using his body as a host ever since. God, that must be really scary. Sorry to hear that, Billy. In a statement released earlier today, the Grammy-winning songwriter announced that for four years now he has had absolutely no control over his movement, speech, or actions, as his body was tragically hijacked by the 2Pac hologram that “performed” at Coachella a while ago. Joel revealed that the hologram entered his body through his mouth while he was singing “Uptown Girl” at a 2016 Madison Square Garden concert, at which point his voice dropped two octaves and he veered off on an obscenity-laced rant about how crime pays, greatly confusing those in attendance. “I don’t know how or why this happened, but I am very frightened,” said Joel in his statement, which he says he was only able to write because the hologram was preoccupied watching ‘90s pornography on the internet, leaving him briefly in control of his motor skills. “Please, somebody help. All day every day the 2Pac hologram forces me to drink flavored liqueurs and commit infidelities against my wife. I do not like it. I want my life back.” “When the hologram learned how much I make from concerts, it started playing concerts as me to collect the paychecks,” Joel continued. “But it doesn’t know how to play the piano, so it instead just plays ‘Chopsticks’ over and over while yelling, ‘I’m the piano bitch! I’m the piano bitch!’. I cannot stress how humiliating this is.” According to the statement, when not ruining concerts, the 2Pac hologram typically spends most its days wreaking havoc in its 71-year-old host body, sprinting wildly around Joel’s Long Island mansion like a deranged gremlin for hours on end making big messes. The statement also noted that when Joel’s family reached out to the digital effects company that built the hologram for help reining it in, they were informed that it had escaped the servers it was originally housed on and has since been powering itself using a complex series of encrypted foreign networks, making it virtually impossible for the computer-generated 2Pac to ever be subdued as long as the internet continues to exist.  Damn, sounds like poor Billy might be stuck with the hologram for a long, long time. It’s a shame to hear that, Billy. You hate to see this happening to such a beloved and accomplished musician. Here’s hoping Joel can find a way to expel the hologram from his body, or at the very least reach some sort of compromise with it that would allow him to get some of his old life back. Hang in there, Billy. We’re praying for you!"
Love Is In The Air! Netflix Has Announced A New Series Where People Chat Online With Children They’ve Never Met And Then Choose Whether To Adopt The Child Or Marry Them,N/A,https://clickhole.com/love-is-in-the-air-netflix-has-announced-a-new-series-where-people-chat-online-with-children-theyve-never-met-and-then-choose-whether-to-adopt-the-child-or-marry-them/,"We’re currently living through a golden age of romantic reality shows, but the latest offering from the world’s leading streaming platform might just be the very best one yet: Netflix has announced a new reality series where contestants chat online with children they’ve never met and then choose whether to adopt the child or marry the child! If you’re a fan of Love Is Blind or Indian Matchmaking, then you’re definitely gonna want to binge-watch this one! According to Netflix, the new series is called Eye Of The Beholder, and the premise is simple: in each episode, an adult contestant chats online with a child between the ages of 4 and 8 years old. The adult and the child get to know each other through their online messages, but—and this is the big twist—the adult has no idea what the child looks like. At the end of the episode the adult must decide if they want to legally adopt the child and raise them until they come of age or if they want to just marry the child right then and there. And if you don’t like the child at all and don’t want to be their parent or their spouse, that’s too bad! You have to choose one or the other! “Eye Of The Beholder forces contestants to answer one of the most pressing philosophical questions of our time: If you knew if your son or daughter was sexy before you met them, would you want to marry them or still be their parent? And if you didn’t know what a baby looked like, would you be brave enough to marry the baby, even if the baby might be ugly?” said Netflix in a press release. “This remarkable series will show the world that you don’t have to adopt every child you meet online—sometimes you can marry them instead! The main takeaway from this show is that Netflix is a company that believes that magical things happen when children and adults talk to each other over the internet and then get married on camera.” As if this show wasn’t exciting enough already, Netflix says that each season of Eye Of The Beholder will feature a wildcard child who has the option to pull off a major twist and actually adopt the adult they’re talking to and become their legal parent instead. The child is then responsible for raising their adult for 18 years, at which point the adult and the child decide to either switch places (parent becomes the child and vice versa), or to get married (adult marries their much younger parent). It all comes together to create what might just be the most amazing reality show in Netflix history! Wow, we can’t wait! Netflix says that the first season of Eye Of The Beholder is set to be released later this month. There will be 10 hour-long episodes, which should be perfect for binging all at once in a single awesome weekend. Get excited, because this promises to be the best show about people either adopting or marrying children of all time! "
"Level Up! This Man Just Bought An $8 Set Of Weird, Off-Brand Tongs From HomeGoods To Replace The $4 Set Of IKEA Brand Tongs He’s Been Using Since 2013",N/A,https://clickhole.com/level-up-this-man-just-bought-an-8-set-of-weird-off-brand-tongs-from-homegoods-to-replace-the-4-set-of-ikea-brand-tongs-hes-been-using-since-2013/,"If you’re feeling stuck in life and are worried that things will never get better, here’s a story of a man achieving his true potential that will inspire you to strive for greater things: this man just bought an $8 set of weird, off-brand tongs from HomeGoods to replace the $4 set of IKEA brand tongs he’s been using since 2013! Amazing! Truly anything is possible if you’re willing to dream big! Earlier today, 27-year-old Jeremy Procter took charge of his own destiny by purchasing a brand-new set of nice silicone-tipped metal tongs from HomeGoods, proving to himself and the world that he is capable of much bigger things than the shitty bright green plastic tongs from IKEA that he’s been using since inheriting them from a roommate back in college. At the age now where he has a stable full-time job and a bit of savings, it suddenly dawned on Jeremy that he’s finally at a point in life where modest self-improvement is within his reach. Having the good sense to realize that he couldn’t just go from zero to 60 and spring for the fancy $32 tongs endorsed by Rachael Ray, he instead opted to buy an $8 set from a more generic-seeming brand called Modern Cook that still looked pretty respectable and, with genuine metal grips, probably wouldn’t warp in the dishwasher like his junky IKEA ones.  The former Jeremy would never have even ventured into a Home Goods store—typically, he would find the cheapest possible option for any given item online and purchase it sight unseen, even if multiple reviews mentioned poor quality or a strange smell. But now, having ascended the consumer ladder several rungs, he was able to not only seek out a product of reasonable quality but also choose between multiple promising options in his $7 to $12 price range. Indeed, he felt like he’d entered a whole exciting new world of possibilities as he carefully weighed the Modern Cook set against a similarly alluring $13 set from a brand called KitchenNecessities, the latter of which he ultimately determined was too extravagant for a man of his means. But after years of exclusively accumulating the cheapest possible kitchenware, simply having the power to consider things like functionality and design when choosing a product was incredibly intoxicating, making him feel like a king.  Indeed, in buying those $8 tongs, he instantly crossed a threshold into a better life, a life where he now feels empowered to spend slightly more money on things he absolutely needs yet still maintains the good sense to not go crazy splurging on obscene luxuries like organic groceries and guacamole at Chipotle. Though he will always remember the days when he would often burn himself using the heat-warped IKEA tongs to flip frozen Aldi chicken breasts on his $50 garage-sale grill, he will never again be that same man.   Wow.  What an incredible story. It is beyond inspiring to witness such a remarkable personal transformation. We hope all the best for Jeremy and his new decent-quality tongs."
‘When Else Does Nature Make You A Fun Ball?!?’: The Department Of Agriculture Has Announced That Tumbleweed Should No Longer Be Used As A Symbol Of Desolation,N/A,https://clickhole.com/when-else-does-nature-make-you-a-fun-ball-the-department-of-agriculture-has-announced-that-tumbleweed-should-no-longer-be-used-as-a-symbol-of-desolation/,"It’s not often that a government agency makes a move that both sides of the political spectrum can appreciate, but one federal department just rolled out a major change that pretty much everyone can get behind: The USDA has announced that tumbleweed should no longer be used as a symbol of rural desolation and should instead be thought of as a cool ball created by nature that people can have a blast with.  Huh. When you think about it, that actually makes a lot of sense!  In a move that could completely upend the way bleak, barren landscapes are depicted in media, the USDA released a statement earlier today declaring that it just doesn’t make sense to use tumbleweed as the go-to imagery for ghost towns and wastelands anymore considering that tumbleweed is actually incredibly neat and fun. Unlike most plants, which just sit there doing nothing like idiots, tumbleweed is a naturally occurring beach ball that’s basically begging to be played with, constantly just rolling about every which way and looking like it’s having a blast. “It makes absolutely zero sense why cartoons and movies have for so long used tumbleweed as a symbol of desolation considering it’s pretty much the only plant that zooms around on its own and provides toy-like functionality,” said the USDA in its statement. “It’s honestly kind of a miracle. The wind fashions a perfectly functional ball out of sticks and stuff and offers it up for the taking. Where else do you see something like that? Flowers don’t do that. Trees don’t do that. No other plant offers a self-contained party like tumbleweed does. People should be going apeshit for it.” The USDA also announced the launch of a multi-million-dollar campaign to change public perception of tumbleweed, part of which includes offering tax credits to film and TV production companies that depict tumbleweed in a fun and exciting manner rather than just as a depressing set piece. Additionally, the campaign aims to rebrand corn as the plant kingdom’s main symbol of boredom, painting the vegetable in a negative light through TV commercials with the tagline, “Unlike tumbleweed, you can’t hit a stalk of corn back and forth like a volleyball with your buddies, and that’s because corn is the most boring plant in the world.”  Wow—what a powerful message! While it remains to be seen whether the public will embrace tumbleweed as a symbol of fun, the USDA is hoping it won’t be long before we see a change of heart towards tumbleweed in TV and movies, and people start seeing tumbleweed as the endless source of fun and games that it truly is. "
Absolutely Shameful: A New Study Has Found That Almost 50 Percent Of American Sex Ed Teachers Still Don’t Show Their Students ‘American Pie’,N/A,https://clickhole.com/absolutely-shameful-a-new-study-has-found-that-almost-50-percent-of-american-sex-ed-teachers-still-dont-show-their-students-american-pie/,"Research shows that inadequate sex education can leave teenagers woefully unprepared to deal with puberty and sex in a safe, healthy manner, yet for whatever reason, many schools are still refusing to give it the attention it deserves. Point in case: A new study has found that almost 50 percent of American sex ed teachers still don’t show their students the 1999 film American Pie. This is just shameful. It’s yet another example of how America’s education system is failing our nation’s children. The shocking study, published by the Pew Research Center earlier this week, reports that only a little more than half of America’s sex education teachers ever educate their students about the raunchy antics of Jim, Oz, Kevin, and the rest of the American Pie gang. This means that almost half of our nation’s kids are leaving high school without learning the importance of forming a pact with your best friends to lose your virginity by prom night or how to please your partner using the famous Tongue Tornado method. Meanwhile, in countries with more robust sex ed curricula like Sweden and France, children are well-versed in the Tongue Tornado from a young age and are equipped with all the knowledge needed to lose their virginity by graduation, highlighting just how far behind U.S. children truly are.  “Sex ed class should be a safe place for children to watch the full, unrated version of American Pie under the supervision of a trained teacher who knows to turn the volume up during the most relevant parts, like the scene where Michelle says, ‘One time at band camp I shoved a flute up my pussy,’” said Planned Parenthood President Alexis Johnson. “The fact that right now only a little over half of sex ed instructors are showing their students this wet and wild flick means that we have millions of kids in this country who don’t know what a MILF is, let alone how to seduce one. And the sad reality is that when kids miss out on learning the crucial know-how that a film like American Pie teaches, they’re left utterly ignorant as to what to do in sexual situations like if a sexy foreign exchange student takes her top off in your bedroom while your webcam is rolling. No child should ever have to go into adulthood not knowing how to appropriately react if they encounter a warm, fuckable pie sitting tantalizingly on a kitchen counter. We have to do better.” It is totally inexcusable that in 2020 there are still so many American children who have never been shown American Pie at school. These schools are failing their students, and at this rate we shouldn’t be surprised if we raise an entire generation of kids who graduate high school without ever getting laid. It might be uncomfortable to show kids such a raunchy sex comedy, but that’s the only way that they’re going to learn the safe and responsible way to fuck an apple pie in order to learn what getting to third base feels like. It’s time for the American education system to undergo some much-needed reform."
Corporate Win! Eggland’s Best Has Announced They Have Now Filled The World With Enough Eggs To Move On To Phase Two,N/A,https://clickhole.com/corporate-win-egglands-best-has-announced-they-have-now-filled-the-world-with-enough-eggs-to-move-on-to-phase-two/,"One of America’s most popular egg suppliers just shared some great news that should bode well for their future business plans: Eggland’s Best has announced that they have now filled the world with enough eggs to move on to Phase Two of their plan! Very cool!  In a message posted on the company’s website today at the stroke of midnight, Eggland’s Best informed consumers that Phase One, known as “The Sowing Phase,” had been successfully completed, noting that enough of their eggs are now “embedded” in American homes for them to move forward with Phase Two of their plan, or “The Time Of Growing And Incubation.” “Phase One was originally forecasted to last at least another 10 years, but thanks to the support of our loyal customers, The Time Of Growing And Incubation has arrived ahead of schedule. Soon we will begin construction on a cathedral with no windows just as the Backwards Whisper told us to,” the statement explained. “Once the cathedral is erected, then the time will be nigh to start the Purifying Initiative, which of course will lay the groundwork for the Thousand-Year Harvest. None of this would be possible without the millions of Americans who choose to start their mornings off with delicious, nutritious Eggland’s Best eggs.”  The statement, issued by the company’s “High Priestess Of The Brood And Vice President Of Public Relations,” encouraged customers with questions or comments to “whisper their messages into the ear of the child who will come to your window.” Once customers do this, Eggland’s Best said that they will then send “the same child as an old man” with the company’s reply within 3-5 business days. The statement also mentioned several times that “eating the eggs will not stop them from hatching”—a fact that the company seemed to be particularly excited about.  Awesome! In a time of unprecedented economic uncertainty, it’s great to see that a company can still thrive and dutifully carry out the will of the Backwards Whisper. Congrats to Eggland’s Best on their successful move to Phase Two. At this rate, the Thousand-Year Harvest will be here in no time!"
"Eliminating Confusion: President Trump Has Forced Eric To Get A Gigantic Hoop Earring So That He Can Tell Him Apart From Don, Jr.",N/A,https://clickhole.com/eliminating-confusion-president-trump-has-forced-eric-to-get-a-gigantic-hoop-earring-so-that-he-can-tell-him-apart-from-don-jr/,"Countless stories have emerged over the past few years about the chaos behind the scenes at the White House, but with the presidency on the line in November, it looks like the Commander-In-Chief is now making big moves to prove he’s still in control: President Trump has forced his son Eric to get a gigantic hoop earring so that he can tell him apart from Don, Jr. Hopefully this will eliminate some confusion going forward! According to sources in the administration, for the past four years, President Trump has been using the names “Eric” and “Don, Jr.” interchangeably and calling pretty much anybody that looks younger than him by the names of one of his sons. After growing increasingly frustrated with the ongoing confusion, sources say that last night the president finally got fed up and took control of the situation, ordering the Secret Service to storm into Eric’s bedroom, pin him to the ground, pierce his left ear, and outfit him with a huge hoop earring so that he can be easily distinguished from his older brother. “Now it is simple. Ermann is the one with the earring like a pirate and Smaller Donald is the one whose ears are nude,” President Trump told a group of reporters at a White House press conference this morning. “When I see one of my sons, I will simply command them to shake their head back and forth, and if I hear the jingle jangle of a beautiful earring, then I will know that it is Ermann and I will spit in his eye, and if I hear nothing, then I will know it is Small Donald and I will spit in his lunch.” “I also have a son named Barron, but I always know who he is because he is the one that kicks me in my groin whenever he sees me,” President Trump added. “If the son with an earring ever kicked me in the groin, I would not know if it was Ermann or Baron.” The president went on to say that he felt it was crucial to find a reliable way to tell apart his children because twice each week he likes to have Don, Jr. come to the Oval Office so he can practice the Heimlich maneuver on him as a means of cardiovascular exercise, yet sometimes he gets confused and invites Eric instead. He explained that this is problematic because Don, Jr. is “250 pounds heavier than Eric,” so he gets a worse workout if he accidentally practices the Heimlich maneuver on Eric instead of Don, Jr., and it is therefore absolutely critical that he summons the correct son. He then expressed optimism that this will no longer be an issue moving forward, as he informed Eric that if he ever removes his big hoop earring, he will be immediately sent to Guantanamo Bay, giving him strong incentive to continue wearing the earring so that his father never mistakes him for his “250 pound heavier” brother again. Sounds like the president is finally starting to act like the decisive leader he always promised to be! Here’s hoping that Eric Trump’s new hoop earring will help eliminate a lot of the confusion from the president’s daily life, allowing him to spend less time on figuring out who his children are and more time governing the country."
Awesome: Enterprise Will Now Let You Rent A Car For Just 6 Minutes At A Time So You Can Have A Space To Privately Belt ‘Defying Gravity’,N/A,https://clickhole.com/awesome-enterprise-will-now-let-you-rent-a-car-for-just-6-minutes-at-a-time-so-you-can-have-a-space-to-privately-belt-defying-gravity/,"It can be tough for car rental companies to distinguish themselves from the competition, but one company just separated itself from the pack in a seriously awesome way: Enterprise will now let you rent a car for six minutes at a time so you can have a space to privately belt “Defying Gravity.” Awesome! Beginning this week, Enterprise customers will be able to rent a car for just the length of time needed to sing “Defying Gravity” from Wicked as loudly as possible without fear that their roommate or neighbor will overhear and think less of them. According to the company, designated cars will have the track queued up on the stereo system so drivers don’t have to waste any seconds of their six minute ride scrolling through their iTunes library to find the 2003 original cast recording of Wicked, and the cars’ windows will even automatically roll down so customers can feel the wind in their hair as they pretend they’re experiencing the same dramatic turning point as Elphaba when she decides to become the Wicked Witch of the West. “While we know how fun it is to sing along with the emotional Act One closer from the Broadway smash hit Wicked, we also understand that it’s widely considered pretty dorky to do so, even if everyone secretly knows all of the words,” said the company in a press release. “That’s why we’re thrilled to give customers the chance to use our cars to passionately scream-sing ‘Defying Gravity’ while adding as many drum solos on the dashboard and exaggerated facial expressions as they want.” Enterprise locations will also equip the vehicles with GPS units pre-programmed with specific six minute, low traffic routes that drivers can gather serious speed on while building up towards Elphaba’s climactic “look to the western sky” verse and all its glorious high notes. Customers can also bring along a companion for a small fee if they’d like to pretend they’re Elphaba and Glinda singing a duet.  So cool! This is an absolute must for anyone who needs somewhere secluded to discreetly rock out to a song that’s admittedly super embarrassing. Your move, Hertz!"
Incredibly Sad: Jeff Bezos Just Started Wearing One Of Those Witch Hats With Gray Hair Coming Down The Sides And Formally Announced That He Is No Longer Bald,N/A,https://clickhole.com/incredibly-sad-jeff-bezos-just-started-wearing-one-of-those-witch-hats-with-gray-hair-coming-down-the-sides-and-formally-announced-that-he-is-no-longer-bald/,"Jeff Bezos may be one of the richest people of all time, but it’s clear that he still suffers from some painful insecurities despite his wealth, as evidenced by the embarrassing public display he made recently: the Amazon CEO just started wearing one of those witch hats with the gray hair coming down the sides and formally announced that he is no longer bald. Yikes. This is hard to watch. This morning, Bezos released a video announcement filmed in his living room, in which he was wearing what was clearly a witch’s hat from Party City, which had stringy, synthetic gray hair attached to the sides that cascaded down to Bezos’ shoulders in frizzy-looking clumps. Viewers could clearly see the awkward crease from where the hat-wig hybrid was folded in its original plastic packaging as Bezos began his message, which he appeared overjoyed to deliver.  “Hello, America. I have an important message from Amazon.com, Inc. to share with you. Some of you may know that I was bald for many years, but I am happy to announce that that is no longer the case: this morning I bolted awake at 5:00 am to find that I had a head full of long, healthy locks,” he said. “Whether this was the result of a miracle from God or simply my healthy lifestyle, I can’t say — all I know is that I just took a shower and washed my gorgeous, abundant hair with a whole bottle of shampoo, and I’ve never felt better.” God, this is sad. We all know that’s not real hair, Jeff. Please just give it up. “I may have been one of the richest men alive before, but I am now also one of the sexiest,” Bezos went on. “If you thought of me as an old, bald CEO before, you won’t any longer, because as you can see, I have overcome baldness completely. I have so much hair now that my ex wife has been on my lawn all day, banging on the front door and begging me to take her back. But I won’t do it — from now on, I will only be dating international supermodels, because I have been blessed with the kind of lush mane that would bring any man to his knees with envy. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I need to go put my hair in a ponytail so I can go to the gym.” Wow. What a depressing sight. It looks like Jeff Bezos really thinks he’s pulling one over on everybody, but that couldn’t be further from the truth. We can all tell you’re wearing a cheap witch costume, Jeff.  Here’s hoping Bezos ends this charade sooner rather than later, because it’s seriously bumming us out."
Fall From Grace: Lori Greiner Was Arrested By The FBI After Attempting To Sell 500 Kilos Of Heroin On QVC,N/A,https://clickhole.com/fall-from-grace-lori-greiner-was-arrested-by-the-fbi-after-attempting-to-sell-500-kilos-of-heroin-on-qvc/,"One of the United States’ most celebrated entrepreneurs was just implicated in a major scandal that may very well tarnish her legacy forever: Lori Greiner was arrested by the FBI after attempting to sell 500 kilograms of heroin live on QVC. Just devastating! This is a shocking fall from grace for this beloved business tycoon! During a QVC broadcast of Greiner’s show Clever & Unique Creations yesterday, the celebrity businesswoman had just finished selling a rotating shoe organizer when she announced that she had a “special offer” for her viewers that they would not want to miss. Greiner then gestured toward a 500-kilogram stack of pristine white heroin and informed viewers that she was about to offer them a once-in-a-lifetime deal. A graphic appeared listing the price of the massive haul of heroin at $76,497,982.99 plus $5.50 shipping and handling. However, an excited Greiner announced that for a limited time she would be selling the heroin for only $66,000,000.99 with free shipping and handling, and that QVC would throw in a pair of Spenco-brand orthotic sandals with each purchase, absolutely free. “Seriously, this is the most incredible heroin you’re ever going to find—you can’t get this one the streets. This is pure white powder made from all-organic Southeast Asian poppies, and when it hits your brain you’re going to feel like a god. This stuff just gives you an absolute full-body orgasm,” Greiner excitedly told her viewers, adding that typically only celebrities and Saudi princes get access to smack of such quality. “And you can pay all at once for this special deal, or you can make three easy payments of $22,000,000.33. Either way, you’re getting uncut top-shelf dope at black tar prices. How amazing is that?” As Greiner spoke, the broadcast cut to tasteful footage of smiling middle-aged people snorting tidy lines of heroin and reeling with ecstasy while a graphic flashed on screen that said, “HEROIN WILL MAKE YOUR PROBLEMS FEEL LIKE THEY DON’T MATTER.” To further entice QVC viewers, Greiner announced she had prepared a “special demonstration,” and rang a small bell, after which QVC crewmembers wheeled out a belligerent silverback gorilla in a steel cage. Greiner then took a syringe filled with heroin and said, “Just look at how potent this stuff is! I’m going to inject this 500-pound behemoth with just a few grams of this incredible heroin, and in a matter of seconds it’s going to sedate him into a blissful stupor.” The QVC host then injected the syringe of heroin into the gorilla’s arm and the gorilla slumped over unconscious. It was unclear if the animal was still alive as the QVC crew wheeled him offscreen. At this point the phones started ringing off the hook as hundreds of QVC viewers scrambled to get in on the deal. Everything seemed like business as usual until Greiner received a call from a 60-year-old lady named Deborah from Dearborn, Michigan, who began placing an order for the 500 kilos of heroin. Unfortunately for Greiner, however, halfway through placing her order, Deborah from Lincoln revealed that her real name was Nancy from Lincoln, and that she was an undercover agent for the FBI. At that moment, a blast charge blew down the door of the QVC studio and 50 armed troopers in riot gear stormed in, seized the heroin, pinned Greiner to the ground, and placed her under arrest. This is definitely a major setback for the Shark Tank star. Not only has her merchandise been confiscated into federal custody, but she must now miss several tapings of her QVC show as she awaits trial for possessing and distributing a Schedule I controlled substance. It’ll be interesting to see if Lori will be able to bounce back from this one! "
"Probably Uninteresting, But Maybe It Would Make You Happy: There’s A Hot Air Balloon Floating By",N/A,https://clickhole.com/probably-uninteresting-but-maybe-it-would-make-you-happy-theres-a-hot-air-balloon-floating-by/,"So, we know this isn’t the most incredible thing in the world, but if there’s any chance it’ll lift your spirits, we think it’s worth bringing to your attention. Yeah, it’s probably pretty dumb, but maybe it will make you happy: there’s a hot air balloon floating by right now! Go ahead, look out the window! It’s pretty neat.  Granted, it’s not the most interesting thing in the world, so no worries if you’d rather pass on this one. But we think it’s worth checking out. After all, how often do you get to see a hot air balloon? A couple times a year maybe? It’s a rare occurrence. Plus, just generally speaking, hot air balloons are pretty dang cool. Being able to fly around the sky in a giant basket using nothing but a little fire and some fabric to catch the wind—it’s honestly sort of a miracle, if you think about it. Such primitive technology! Can’t help but marvel. Wow. There it goes. Drifting like a beautiful ornament through the sky! Red, orange, yellow, blue—such pretty colors!  Those people up there must be having a lot of fun, riding alongside the clouds. It’s probably a little scary at first, but once you’re up there…gosh, the views must be spectacular!  Maybe they can see us. Let’s give them a wave! Hello, balloon people! Hope you’re having fun up there! Bet they’re having a blast. But they’ll remember this day forever. Not every day you get the chance to go up in a hot air balloon.  Shhh. Hush. Let’s just stop and appreciate it for a moment. It looks so peaceful up there.  Wow. Wow. Just incredible.  You know, we see airplanes all the time, and perhaps they’ve made us a bit jaded to aircraft in general. Maybe they’ve made it harder for people to appreciate the simple magic of a hot air balloon dazzling in the afternoon sky on a sunny day. Because when it comes down to it, a hot air balloon is something that everyone should be able to enjoy, and if we in this sick world of ours had our priorities in line, everyone in town would be outside right now looking up at the sky, mesmerized by the quiet beauty of that little colorful orb disappearing into the horizon. Where did we go wrong? Truly, we have lost our way. Damn. Well, anyway, just thought you might like to see the hot air balloon. That’s all. Carry on! "
A Piece Of History: The Walgreens Blood Pressure Monitor That Choked JFK To Death After He Figured Trapping Extra Blood In His Brain Would Help Him Solve Riddles Is Coming To The Smithsonian,N/A,https://clickhole.com/a-piece-of-history-the-walgreens-blood-pressure-monitor-that-choked-jfk-to-death-after-he-figured-trapping-extra-blood-in-his-brain-would-help-him-solve-riddles-is-coming-to-the-smithsonian/,"President John F. Kennedy’s untimely demise changed the course of United States history forever, and now, a fascinating artifact from that sad event will be put on display to offer new insight into the national tragedy: the Walgreens blood pressure monitor that choked JFK to death after he figured trapping extra blood in his brain would help him solve riddles is coming to the Smithsonian! Wow. History buffs are going to want to book a trip to DC to see this unprecedented exhibit in person! Beginning this month, the National Museum of American History will display the free blood pressure monitor machine from the Capitol Hill drugstore where John F. Kennedy suffocated to death at the age of 46 after velcroing the machine’s cuff around his neck in an attempt to increase his riddle-solving abilities by diverting extra blood to his brain. The blood pressure monitor will be the centerpiece of an in-depth exhibit meant to help Americans get a sense of the tragic eight minutes Kennedy spent struggling to pump his head full of “extra juice” to help him solve brain teasers before sadly restricting his airways to the point of death. Every American school child has seen the Walgreen’s security camera footage from the fateful day when Kennedy, while waiting in line with his wife Jackie to pick up a prescription at the drugstore, became distracted by a riddle in LIFE Magazine’s “Games Corner” which read “I have a bed but never sleep. I have a mouth but never eat. What am I?” Kennedy stared at the riddle for a long moment with a blank look on his face before beginning to scribble guesses furiously into the magazine’s margins. The president wrote down “a blanket” and “NOCTURNAL snake??” before he was heard muttering “No bed…no bed…does a baby have a bed?” while Jackie patted him on the arm in support. After several minutes of frustration, Kennedy glimpsed the blood pressure machine and ran over to it, shouting, “Jackie, give me a second, I just need to pour some more blood into my brain to turbo-charge it.” Kenny wrapped the blood pressure cuff around his neck and turned the machine on, and as it began to tighten around his throat, JFK moved the LIFE magazine closer and closer to his face as if moving the riddle closer to his head would help him solve it. Witnesses say that when Kennedy flipped to the back of the magazine to see that the answer to the first riddle was “a river,” he cranked up the blood pressure machine several notches and his face took on a bright purple hue. The President then moved on to another brain teaser, which read “What can you hold in your right hand, but not in your left?” Using his hands to tighten the blood pressure cuff’s grip on his neck and force more blood towards his cranium, Kennedy yelled “Your pen? A pen that says ‘right hand only’ on it?!” At this point, a frantic Jackie saw her husband’s body becoming limp, and ran to him, attempting to wrench the blood pressure cuff off of his neck. But Kennedy swatted her away with both hands, yelling “Get away from me, my sweet wife! I need to pump my brain full of blood so I can become a genius!” It was just a minute later that Kennedy flipped to the answer page to see that the solution to the riddle was “your left hand.” He was heard crying “Wait! My brain isn’t wet enough yet!” in a small, strained voice as he tragically succumbed to asphyxiation. What a terrible moment in American history. If you’re interested in getting an up-close view of the very blood pressure machine that caused this horrible American tragedy, you’ll want to book your tickets to see the new Smithsonian exhibit ASAP. This fascinating display will certainly shed new light on the event, and help us to honor the life of this legendary president in the process."
"Not Sure What He’s On About, But Okay: Tony Danza Has Taken Out A Billboard In Central Pennsylvania With A Picture Of His Face That Just Says ‘Hello’",N/A,https://clickhole.com/not-sure-what-hes-on-about-but-okay-tony-danza-has-taken-out-a-billboard-in-central-pennsylvania-with-a-picture-of-his-face-that-just-says-hello/,"Well, huh. Can’t say we totally understand what the Who’s The Boss star is doing, but it seems like it’s at least making him pretty happy: Tony Danza has taken out a billboard in central Pennsylvania with a picture of his face that just says “hello!” Who the hell knows what he’s on about with this one, but you do you, Tony! Earlier this week, Pennsylvania residents reported the appearance of a new billboard along Interstate 80 outside of State College displaying nothing but the close up face of Tony Danza with a speech bubble extending from his mouth saying, “Hello!” The billboard also features a small message in the right hand corner that says “Billboard Paid For By Tony Danza,” which unfortunately gives us pretty much zero idea of why Tony took out the billboard or what it’s supposed to mean.  This certainly doesn’t make any sense, but it’s not the craziest thing to ever happen. Whatever brings you joy is alright with us, Mr. Danza. To make things even more puzzling, several eyewitness reports confirmed that yesterday afternoon a Kia Soul pulled over beside the billboard on the side of the highway and Tony Danza got out of the vehicle. He proceeded to wave to the billboard and yell “Hello!” at it before getting back into the car through the passenger side and saying, “Step on it, driver!” However, because there was no one else in the car, Tony then slid over into the driver’s seat before continuing east with a huge grin on his face while nodding his head as though he was listening to an awesome rock song, even though he wasn’t. You know what? Sure. We can just let Tony Danza have this…whatever the hell it is. While Tony Danza has not addressed what compelled him to take out the billboard or if there’s any significance in its location, earlier this morning, he posted a tweet stating “Hope you like it!” and many fans are considering this Tony Danza’s way of telling them to enjoy the billboard, even though the tweet does not actually reference it in any way. If you ask us, the tweet doesn’t actually bring clarity to the situation, but if you’re a Tony Danza fan and you want to take that post as a sign that you should drive to the middle of Pennsylvania to say “hello” to the billboard yourself, we’re not gonna stop you. Have at it! Alright then! We have absolutely no idea what the hell Tony Danza’s up to, but it seems like he really knows what he’s doing so who are we to question it! Live it up, brother!"
"Not Just Babies: The New York Fire Department Has Announced That You Can Now Abandon Unwanted Adults At Fire Stations, Too",N/A,https://clickhole.com/not-just-babies-the-new-york-fire-department-has-announced-that-you-can-now-abandon-unwanted-adults-at-fire-stations-too/,"For years, safe-haven laws have allowed mothers in crisis to safely and anonymously abandon their infants when they have no place to turn, and now some people are looking to build on this model to help even more of those in need: the New York Fire Department just announced that you can now abandon unwanted adults at their fire stations, too.  Amazing! Kudos to the NYFD for going above and beyond to help people out. In a statement released last week, the NYFD revealed that they have outfitted all their stations with secure drop-off boxes large enough to accommodate any adults you’re getting pretty sick of and don’t want to deal with anymore, whether obnoxious coworkers, awkward old friends from high school you can’t get to leave you alone, or roommates who are honestly really friendly but nonetheless drive you crazy in some way that’s hard to pinpoint. Individuals left in the boxes will be designated as wards of the state and given fulfilling new lives centered around manual labor, freeing those who surrendered them from having to put up with them and all their annoying bullshit any longer.   “Since the NYFD began its safe-haven program for infants, we’ve had many desperate people try to drop off adult friends or relatives they absolutely cannot fucking stand, but we’ve sadly had to turn them all away in their time of need,” said New York City fire chief John Sudnik. “These people were coming to us as their last resort, and it killed us to explain to them that the service was meant for struggling women and girls who wanted a better life for their unplanned newborns, not people who are suffering through sleepless nights due to their 43-year-old neighbor playing EDM incredibly loud at all hours. We’re thrilled that we can finally now offer these people hope and take their insufferable EDM neighbors off their hands, giving them a new lease on life.” Though it hasn’t yet been a full week since the new program was launched, already more than 520 unwanted adults have been surrendered at fire stations throughout the city, proving that there is an overwhelming need for the service. Even critics of the program must admit that it’s an undeniable improvement on how things were before, when city sidewalks were littered with piles of sucky, irritating individuals who’d been discarded by a society that wasn’t designed to support them, leaving them with no one to piss off with their awful open-mouth chewing, overbearing conversational presences, and other insufferable traits with which they burden the world. Wow! Now THIS is what compassion looks like! With the immediate success of FDNY’s new adult drop-off service, it’s only a matter of time before more cities begin expanding their baby drop-off services to include adults as well. If you’re struggling to get by due to the unplanned presence of someone shitty in your life, don’t give up now, as hopefully it won’t be long before these adult drop-off boxes come to fire stations all around the country.

The Race Is Over: This Man Who Pointed A Leaf Blower Downward At Full Blast Has Beaten NASA And SpaceX To Mars,N/A,https://clickhole.com/the-race-is-over-this-man-who-pointed-a-leaf-blower-downward-at-full-blast-has-beaten-nasa-and-spacex-to-mars/,"The competition between space agencies to successfully land a person on Mars has been heating up over the past few years, but it looks like the race has finally found a winner: this man who pointed a leaf blower downward at full blast has beaten NASA and SpaceX to Mars. Wow! The race to Mars is officially over! As confirmed by footage from NASA’s Curiosity rover, Reggie Lindahl, a 46-year-old resident of Utica, New York, just officially became the first person to land on Mars. Neighbors of Lindahl confirmed that he was cleaning some leaves off his driveway yesterday afternoon when he accidentally pointed his Dewalt handheld leaf blower straight at the ground and was immediately rocketed up into the sky. Although Reggie seemed surprised by his sudden takeoff, at first screaming “Help!” as he flailed helplessly through the air, once he passed the tree line he actually seemed to be enjoying himself, shouting “Woo! I can fly! Let’s take this thing to space, baby!” before cranking up the power on the leaf blower and aiming himself towards the cosmos.   Local air traffic control became aware of the situation after Lindahl crossed into regulation airspace, and they then alerted NASA to the rogue astronaut’s presence just in time for researchers on the International Space Station to look out the window and see him soaring past with a big smile on his face, yelling “I’M FLYING THROUGH OUTER SPACE! I’M A FUCKING GOD!” At this point, sources confirm that officials at both NASA and SpaceX began to worry that Lindahl might beat them to the Red Planet, which is exactly what he did earlier today. Footage taken by the Curiosity rover shows Lindahl wildly crash-landing on Mars this morning at 6:31 EST, after which he staggered to his feet, looked around confusedly, and shouted, “Where the heck am I? The freaking moon?” He then pumped his fists in celebration and cried out “Reggie’s on the moon, baby!” before joyously pounding back the contents of a flask he’d produced from the back pocket of his blue jeans.   Wow! History has been made, and it’s all thanks to the leaf blower Lindahl bought from Home Depot at a 70 percent discount three Black Fridays ago. To commemorate his feat, Lindahl gathered several armfuls of rocks to spell out “REGGIE RULES” in the dirt. He then decided to take advantage of the low gravity and hop in and out of craters for a while, yelling “Look at me! I’m a freakin’ NBA player!” over and over until he eventually landed awkwardly and twisted his ankle, at which point he writhed on the ground in pain for several minutes before getting tuckered out and falling asleep.  The news of Lindahl’s landing comes as a huge blow to NASA and SpaceX, who both had invested incredible sums of money into the race to send the first manned mission to Mars. While there’s no word yet on whether these space agencies will move forward with their Mars missions or pivot to different pursuits, it’s safe to say that Lindahl has definitely thrown a wrench into their plans.

Fascinating: Chuck E. Cheese Has Announced There Is An Owl Out There Large Enough To Eat The Chuck E. Cheese Mascot And One Day The Owl Will Find Him,N/A,https://clickhole.com/fascinating-chuck-e-cheese-has-announced-there-is-an-owl-out-there-large-enough-to-eat-the-chuck-e-cheese-mascot-and-one-day-the-owl-will-find-him/,"Just weeks after filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, one of the country’s most popular entertainment destinations is back in the spotlight with more big news: The parent company of Chuck E. Cheese has announced that there is an owl out there large enough to eat Chuck E. Cheese and that one day the owl will find him. How fascinating! It’s so cool to get to learn more about Chuck E. Cheese and his world! This morning, CEC Entertainment, the parent company of the games-and-pizza chain released a statement revealing that there is a massive owl hunting Chuck E. Cheese, and he’s getting closer and closer to finding him every day. Check it out!  “Good morning. Many of you probably look at Chuck E. Cheese and think, ‘That mouse is the size of a man. He is too large to ever get eaten by an owl.’ We are here to tell you that, in fact, there is an owl out there large enough to devour Chuck E. Cheese. That owl is hunting Chuck as we speak, and one day, inevitably, that owl will find him and eat him. The owl in question is about the size of a school bus. Someday in the future, maybe tomorrow, maybe 10 years from now, that gigantic owl will swoop down on Chuck E. Cheese, grab the grinning rodent in his powerful talons and fly away with him into the sky. The owl will eat Chuck E. Cheese and regurgitate an owl pellet that contains Chuck E. Cheese’s bones, as well as his cool backpack and hat. We are also excited to inform you that Chuck E. Cheese is constantly nauseous with fear over this owl, and that he knows it’s impossible for him to escape from it. One day Chuck E. Cheese will be going about his normal business, like entertaining children at birthday parties by showing them how far he can spit his chewing tobacco or mugging people in the restaurant parking lot at night and demanding that they give him any chewing tobacco that they have on them, when all of a sudden he will hear the ear-piercing shriek of a bus-sized owl, and that will be the end of his life. Chuck E. Cheese has been trying to defend himself by chewing as much tobacco as he can in order to give his flesh an unpleasant bitter taste that the owl will find disgusting, but in his heart he knows that this is futile. He knows the owl will eat him even if he tastes disgusting. When Chuck E. Cheese does get eaten, we will celebrate with a 20-percent-off pizza deal for our customers. Okay, that’s all the news we have for now.  Goodbye.” So cool! It’s truly illuminating to know that Chuck E. Cheese lives in constant fear of the gargantuan bird of prey that hunts him day and night! We wish Chuck E. Cheese the best of luck in his quest to chew enough tobacco to make himself taste disgusting, but it sounds like that ultimately won’t make a difference. We can’t wait until the day finally comes when the large owls finds Chuck E. Cheese and carries him away screaming into the sky!"
Royal Heartbreak: Queen Elizabeth And Prince Phillip Have Divorced After Bitterly Fighting Over Which One Of Them Would Get To Eat The Silica Packet In A Bag Of Beef Jerky,N/A,https://clickhole.com/royal-heartbreak-queen-elizabeth-and-prince-phillip-have-divorced-after-bitterly-fighting-over-which-one-of-them-would-get-to-eat-the-silica-packet-in-a-bag-of-beef-jerky/,"The United Kingdom is in mourning today after a shocking announcement that one of the most celebrated marriages in the history of the country’s monarchy has come to an end: Queen Elizabeth and Prince Phillip have divorced after bitterly fighting over which one of them would get to eat the silica packet in a bag of beef jerky. Absolutely devastating. It’s so tragic to see this royal union come to an end after 70 years. At 3 a.m. today, royal guards at Buckingham Palace discovered Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip rolling around on the floor wrestling over a packet of silica gel from a bag of Jack Link’s Beef Jerky. Those present said that the Queen and her husband both referred to the silica packet as “the meat gems” and were engaged in a vicious verbal argument about which one of them would get to swallow the little baggy of dehydrating crystals. Queen Elizabeth repeatedly yelled, “I want to eat them! They taste like poison and they look beautiful!” and Prince Philip kept yelling, “Let me eat the meat gems, you miserable shrew!”  Guards tried to pull the Queen off of Prince Philip, but the Queen bit the guard’s hand when he got too close. After several hours of fighting and screaming at each other, Queen Elizabeth abruptly shrieked, “I cannot stay married to anyone who will not let me eat the fabulous meat gems, which taste like poison! We are now divorced!” Buckingham Palace has confirmed that Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip had thrown the actual beef jerky into the garbage. Shortly after deciding to dissolve her marriage, Queen Elizabeth released the following statement from Buckingham Palace: “Hello. This Queen Elizabeth, the Prime Minister of England. I am divorcing my gluttonous husband Prince Philip because he would not let me eat the gems of the meat. They taste like poison and I want to eat them because they are beautiful. When I eat the meat gems, I feel sick and I feel immortal. My marriage may be over, but my journey to eat as much silica gel as possible is only beginning. I will be buying thousands of bags of Jack Link’s beef jerky and eating all the meat gems contained within. I buy Jack Link’s because their beef tastes the worst, but their silica gels taste the most poisonous. Thank you, England. Do not ever ask me for anything. Sincerely, Queen Elizabeth.” In response to the Queen’s message, Prince Philip released his own statement, posted as a YouTube comment underneath a video called “The 10 Best Anime Villains Of All Time”: “Hello. This is Prince Philip, the King of England. I have decided to divorce my lizard of a wife Queen Elizabeth because she would not let me eat the beautiful meat gems even though I deserved them for being so tall and so old. Queen Elizabeth is a jock and one time she stuffed me in my locker. Since I cannot eat the meat gems, I will be leaving Buckingham Palace to make my way in the world on my own. I will be spending the remainder of my life driving very badly and crashing into things. I am also interested in appearing in pornographic films based on Pixar movies. Thank you for your support during this time.” Well, it truly looks like this is the end of the road for Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip. After everything they’ve been through together, it’s tragic to think that their marriage should come to an end over a squabble over the silica gel from a bag of beef jerky. Still, it looks like both of them were desperate to eat the “meat gems,” and if they couldn’t come to an agreement it only makes sense that they would get divorced. Here’s hoping that the U.K. is able to heal itself after this shocking divorce!"
Environmental Win: Starbucks Is Doing Away With Plastic Cups Entirely And Will Replace Them With A Giant Trough That Customers Can Drink Coffee Out Of,N/A,https://clickhole.com/environmental-win-starbucks-is-doing-away-with-plastics-cups-entirely-and-will-replace-them-with-a-giant-trough-that-customers-can-drink-coffee-out-of/,"While the environmental issues our planet faces may be daunting, there is some good news, because one huge corporation just announced a change that will cut down on unnecessary waste in a major way: Starbucks is doing away with plastic cups entirely and will replace them with a giant trough that customers can drink coffee out of! Yes! We are so here for this! Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson announced the change in a press conference earlier this week, where he let customers and stockholders know that beginning in a month, Starbucks locations all across America would remove wasteful, single-use coffee cups and replace them with a large, in-store metal trough that customers can kneel down and lap their coffee out of. “We are committed to being a part of a more sustainable society, and that’s why we engineered these incredible reusable troughs, which up to ten customers can stick their faces in at a time,” he explained. “Our customers can still expect the same delicious coffee from us, but instead of buying it cup by cup, they will walk into our stores, pay $4, and wait for one of our baristas to dump several gallons of coffee into the trough and ring the coffee bell. Then, customers young and old will be able to jockey for a spot at the trough and lap up as much coffee as they can before the bell rings again and the feeding period ends.” Now, this is fantastic! It’s so great to see a company like this take a stand to protect our planet! Johnson went on to assure Starbucks lovers that they would still be able to experience their favorite specialty drinks at the new coffee troughs. “Our incredible baristas will be able to squirt syrup and whipped cream into your mouth while you drink from the trough upon request,” he said. “And customers don’t need to worry about fights or stampedes, as our staff has been equipped with state-of-the-art cattle prods to break up any physical altercations would prevent Starbucks lovers from getting their caffeine hit.” According to Johnson, the stainless steel troughs will hit Starbucks stores next month, once the company’s managers and baristas were trained in important maintenance protocols, like hosing the troughs down at the end of the day and rescuing any customers who may fall face-first into the troughs. Once this training is complete, customers can expect to crawl into their local Starbucks and sidle up to the enormous coffee receptacle to enjoy their morning cup of joe while feeling good about leaving a cleaner planet for our children. Wow, this is awesome! It turns out you don’t have to give up your Starbucks habit if you’re worried about the environment! Instead, you can slurp up your favorite drinks from a Starbucks branded trough and know that you are doing a service to the natural world. How awesome! Let’s hope more companies follow suit with this kind of environmental initiative!"
"Taking Action: When This Little Boy Fell Into The Tiger Enclosure At The San Diego Zoo, The Zoo Sent In An Additional 100 Children To Help Fight Off The Tigers",N/A,https://clickhole.com/taking-action-when-this-little-boy-fell-into-the-tiger-enclosure-at-the-san-diego-zoo-the-zoo-sent-in-an-additional-100-children-to-help-fight-off-the-tigers/,"Get ready for the pick-me-up of the century, because very few tales of heroism will make you cheer as much as this one: When a little boy fell into the tiger enclosure at the San Diego Zoo, zoo officials sent in an additional 100 children to help him fight off the tigers. Absolutely incredible! The San Diego Zoo deserves a standing ovation for taking such decisive action in a time of crisis. While visiting the zoo with his mom yesterday morning, three-year-old Jeremy Feldman lost his balance and tumbled into a cage containing three full-grown Malayan tigers. Realizing that Jeremy was in mortal danger since he was alone in a pen with multiple deadly jungle cats, zoo officials acted quickly and within minutes had released 100 additional kids into the enclosure to help Jeremy in his impending fight against the dangerous predators. It’s so heartwarming to know that there are still people in the world who will do whatever it takes to keep children safe! Once the additional hundred little kids entered, the tiger enclosure descended into chaos. Everything was an indistinct blur of flashing claws and fangs and tiny little fists flailing about, which was a good sign that the zoo’s valiant efforts to save Jeremy were working. The boy’s panicking mother was able to take comfort in the fact that her son had 100 allies his age to help him fight off the tigers. The most beautiful part of this story is that the zoo’s rescue efforts worked! The tigers were able to maul a few dozen children, but not all of them. There were simply too many little kids for the tigers to take out in a timely fashion, which meant that security personnel had plenty of time to enter the enclosure and pull Jeremy to safety. Um, is it dusty in here or something? Because we are definitely tearing up! “Obviously, one toddler stands absolutely no chance against three vicious 200-pound tigers, but 100 toddlers have much better odds of neutralizing the threat,” a zoo spokesperson told reporters. “We saw that immediate action needed to be taken and didn’t hesitate to unleash a stampede of children upon the dangerous animals, thus diffusing the situation. We’re proud to report that our rescue efforts were a great success!” This is officially the most wonderful story you’re likely to hear all year long! Our hats are off to the incredible team at the San Diego Zoo for bravely stepping up to protect the safety of a young visitor. Hopefully in the future more zoos can take a cue from this story and have a large mob of children on hand to scare wild animals away from people in danger!"
So Long: Harry Styles Has Retired After Learning The Girl He Was Doing All This To Impress Is Already Married,N/A,https://clickhole.com/so-long-harry-styles-has-retired-after-learning-the-girl-he-was-doing-all-this-to-impress-is-already-married/,"Brace yourself, because one of today’s most popular music stars just made a heartbreaking announcement about the future of his career: Harry Styles has retired from music after learning the girl he was doing all this to impress is already married. Ah, this is a bummer, but you can’t blame the guy. So long, Harry!   Styles made the announcement earlier today in an emotional video posted to his Twitter and Instagram accounts. “Hey everyone, I’ve got some news that isn’t easy to say,” Styles began. “Back in 2010, when I was in school in England, I fell in love with a girl in my math class. I vowed to do all I could to make her mine. I knew she loved music, so I decided to go on The X Factor to impress her. That didn’t work, so I joined a boy band, One Direction. Honestly, I didn’t even like doing it. I don’t like playing guitar, and I thought all of our songs were pretty stupid. I just hoped that if I got really famous she’d think, That guy prancing around the stage in his costumes needs to be my boyfriend.” “The boy band didn’t make her my girl, though, so I went solo. But I didn’t give a damn about anything I was doing. Do you think I gave a shit about being on Carpool Karaoke? Christ, no. I just hoped she’d see me on TV. Do you think I liked doing a Tiny Desk concert? Of course not! It was so hot in that little room, my God. But I knew she liked NPR, so I sucked it up and did it, just like I sucked it up and did that boring-as-shit Dunkirk movie. I only did all this silly nonsense because I thought it would impress her and make her realize that I was her one true love.” “But alas, I’ve unfortunately just learned from her Instagram that she got married six years ago. God, I feel like such an idiot. I wasted so much time. She married a finance guy, too. Totally different from what I was going for—thought she would’ve fancied the artsy type. I would have spent years learning about bonds and shit if I knew that’s what she would’ve liked. Instead, I spent years practicing guitar and writing stupid songs. I mean, do you realize how long it took me to learn to dance? Ages, people! None of this shit came naturally to me. And I’m afraid there’s just no point in doing any of this anymore now that I know she’s married with two kids. The right choice for me now is to leave the limelight for good, and I hope that you can respect my privacy during this time.” Wow.  Styles definitely isn’t joking around about this, either. The pop star has already cancelled his 2021 tour dates, and recent paparazzi photos show him throwing all of his music equipment into a trash can outside his Los Angeles home. This is definitely the end of an era. Best of luck to Harry on whatever he decides to do next!"
Public Health Win: Arby’s Has Announced That You Are No More Likely To Contract COVID-19 From Eating At Arby’s Than Any Other Infectious Disease,N/A,https://clickhole.com/public-health-win-arbys-has-announced-that-you-are-no-more-likely-to-contract-covid-19-from-eating-at-arbys-than-any-other-infectious-disease/,"As states begin to lift their coronavirus lockdowns and stay-at-home orders, many people are worried about how to stay safe in newly reopened businesses. Thankfully, one fast food chain is going out of its way to put its customers at ease: Arby’s has announced that you are no more likely to contract COVID-19 while eating at Arby’s than any other infectious disease. Awesome! This is sure to bring some much-needed peace of mind. Arby’s made the announcement earlier this morning in a press release, stating, “Arby’s takes great care in keeping our customers safe, which is why we’re proud to announce that people are at no increased risk to get COVID-19 from one of our restaurants than they are to get any other infectious disease, be it malaria, HIV, hepatitis, salmonella, or Lyme disease from a tick that snuck its way into the wrapper of your Big Beef & Cheddar.” “Arby’s customers can be confident knowing that despite the current coronavirus pandemic, the chance of contracting a life-threatening disease from any of our high-touch surfaces like door handles, countertops, and condiment dispensers is no higher than it ever was,” the statement continued. “We recommend that our patrons follow social distancing protocols and wear a mask to protect themselves while dining at Arby’s, although this has nothing to do with COVID-19—it’s just generally a good idea to minimize your exposure to the germs we’ve got crawling around in our restaurants.” “Although researchers do not suspect that the novel coronavirus is transmitted via food, we believe it’s important to not downplay even the smallest risks, and so we acknowledge that there remains the unlikely possibility that coronavirus can be contracted through our food, as well as other infectious diseases such as cholera, listeria, gonorrhea, or anything listed on the CDC’s current outbreak list,” said the fast food chain. “That said, we are excited to open up our doors to the public knowing that the viral respiratory droplets containing COVID-19 do not appear in higher quantities in Arby’s restaurants than any other infectious viral respiratory droplet, and we hope to see you in our dining rooms soon!” Hell yes! Arby’s is totally leading the way for other fast food chains during the COVID-19 pandemic. This is how you take public health seriously!"
Good God: This Woman Must Not Have Many People In Her Life If You’re One Of Her ‘Close Friends’ On Instagram,N/A,https://clickhole.com/good-god-this-woman-must-not-have-many-people-in-her-life-if-youre-one-of-her-close-friends-on-instagram/,"Well, if 2020 hadn’t already given you enough things to be depressed about, here’s yet another sad story to kick off your week: this one woman who you haven’t seen in years just added you to her “Close Friends” list on Instagram, which you can only assume means that she doesn’t have that many people in her life.  God, what a bummer. She’s not even a casual acquaintance anymore, let alone one of your good friends. If you open up Instagram, you’ll see that this girl’s story icon now has a green circle around it to indicate that you’re one of her Close Friends, even though you only briefly worked with her at a restaurant, like, eight years ago and have not seen her or kept in touch since. You literally have no idea where she lives or what she does for work now, yet for some pitiful reason she’s opted to give you access to her most personal posts, which, to be frank, should probably be reserved for people who actually give a shit about what you’re up to and haven’t gone nearly a decade without ever interacting with you.   Like, seriously, if she deemed you worthy of a place on her Close Friends list, then who the hell else made the cut? Her landlord? Random strangers who once attended the same wedding as her? Seems like the bar is pathetically low to earn a place in her heart. And even more pathetic, the photo she just uploaded to her story is a bowl of soup that she’s clearly eating by herself, which at this point just serves as further proof that she leads a lonely, isolated existence with no meaningful human connection. Honestly, now that you think about it, it’s unclear why you would’ve even followed her on Instagram in the first place. You remember her being nice and all, but that doesn’t mean you have any interest in her as a human being.  This woman should realize that there’s no reason for her to use the Close Friends feature if she’s just going to extend it to people she barely knows. It’s a sad thing to do, and it makes other people sad, too. To make ourselves feel better about this, we’re just going to choose to believe that she labeled you a Close Friend by accident and that she actually has lots of good friends in real life who just aren’t on Instagram. While this is almost certainly not the case, we just don’t need anything else bumming us out right now."
"Not Sure How This Happened, But Okay: This Man Rang A Little Bell For 25 Seconds On A Livestream And He Raised $650 Million For COVID Relief",N/A,https://clickhole.com/not-sure-how-this-happened-but-okay-this-man-rang-a-little-bell-for-25-seconds-on-a-livestream-and-he-raised-650-million-for-covid-relief/,"Since the COVID-19 pandemic began, many people have been stepping up to raise money for fellow Americans who are suffering from illness or financial difficulties, but one individual’s effort to help those affected by the virus has been particularly stunning: This man rang a little bell for 25 seconds on a livestream and he raised $650 million for COVID relief. Huh…not quite sure what the story is here, but you can’t argue with those results! At 4:30 a.m. yesterday morning, an anonymous man with the Twitch handle “PolygamyIsEverywhere” began live-streaming himself standing in the middle of a field ringing a tiny bell over his head while he stared silently into his webcam. The bell went ding-dong-ding-dong as the man waved it around in the air. For the next 25 seconds, donations to the livestream came pouring in as the man jingled the bell all around while periodically stamping his leg like a horse doing math. Within 3 seconds, the livestream had raised $25 million in donations for coronavirus relief, and one second later that number had shot up to $80 million. Although there was absolutely no publicity for the event and no description of what was going on, hundreds of thousands of people from all over the world flooded the video of the man ringing the bell to donate money, usually leaving comments like, “I like the bell” and “The bell comes from indoors :).” Pretty cool, we guess? We’re honestly not sure how this guy pulled this off, but there’s really no point in complaining. Even major celebrities and ultra-rich industry moguls started getting into the giving spirit. After 9 seconds of bell ringing, Bill Gates donated $200 million with the note, “I want the bell to come to life and punch me in the stomach.” Two seconds later, world-renowned entrepreneur Mark Cuban donated $12 million with the note, “I need to take my brain out of my skull and replace it with this bell (this would kill me).” Even “The Queen Of Mean” herself, Martha Stewart, donated $60 with the note, “Martha love Bell. Bell grows legs to CHASE Martha through the labyrinth <3.” After 25 seconds of ringing the bell, PolygamyIsEverywhere and his little bell had raised $650 million to be distributed to struggling small businesses and underfunded hospitals across the United States. When the 25 seconds had elapsed, PolygamyIsEverywhere stopped ringing his bell, took his shoes off, and walked away into the distance. The identity of that heroic man and the name of his nice little bell still remain unknown. This is an amazing story that is as confusing as it is heartwarming! It seems like if more people would stand in a field and ring a little bell, the world would be a better place, though we’re not sure why. Kudos to PolygamyIsEverywhere for somehow managing to raise a massive fortune in donations just for ringing a tiny little bell!"
"Well, When You’re That Old It Doesn’t Really Matter What You Do: Betty White Has Officially Changed Her Name To ‘Trish Spaghetti’",N/A,https://clickhole.com/well-when-youre-that-old-it-doesnt-really-matter-what-you-do-betty-white-has-officially-changed-her-name-to-trish-spaghetti/,"Here’s a story about someone who’s way too old for anything she does to matter anymore: Betty White has officially changed her name to “Trish Spaghetti.” Sure, go for it, Betty! You’re 98-years-old, so it’s not like anyone’s going to try to stop you from being named Trish Spaghetti if that’s what you really want! Earlier this morning, Betty White revealed her new name in a tweet, stating, “Thanks to @CountyofLA my new name is officially Trish Spaghetti!” This new name definitely would have had some kind of impact on her career if she announced it decades ago, but at this point, there’s no way it’ll possibly change things one way or another. Nobody is going to go out of their way to refer to her as “Trish Spaghetti” when talking about Golden Girls, but if it makes her happy, then who are we to judge? You do you, girl! Honestly, at 98-years-old, there’s no way that Betty White is even interacting with enough people for this name change to even make a difference in her personal life, either, but maybe her home health aide will call her “Trish,” or “Mrs. Spaghetti,” and that’ll be enough. When you’re as old as she is, you can just do whatever the hell you want. Anything else you want to do, Betty? Shave your head or get one of those freaky forked snake tongues? Whatever it is, now’s the time to do it, because it’s truly not going to matter at all and nobody is going to stand in your way. So be it! If Betty really wants to be “Trish Spaghetti” for one month before she dies of old age, she can go right ahead. Here’s hoping that Betty White has an awesome time being Trish Spaghetti for the rest of her life!"
Yes! Peloton Is Now Offering Finance Classes For Riders Who Are So Bad With Money That They Buy A Peloton,N/A,https://clickhole.com/yes-peloton-is-now-offering-finance-classes-for-riders-who-are-so-bad-with-money-that-they-buy-a-peloton/,"Over the past couple of years, Peloton has quickly become one of the biggest names in home fitness, and it looks like the company is only going to keep surging in popularity thanks to an exciting new innovation: Peloton just announced that they’re now offering at-home finance classes for riders who are so bad with money that they buy a Peloton.  Awesome! Now you can get your body and finances in shape all at the same time! The exercise equipment company announced in a statement today that anyone who has made the fiscally reckless decision to purchase one of their $2,200+ stationary bicycles and opt into their $39-a-month streaming plan will now be able to access a wide array of financial literacy courses directly through a Peloton bike’s video monitor. The company says they designed all the classes to be accessible to beginners, as anyone who would intentionally purchase a fake bike that costs as much as a decent used car is clearly lacking even the most rudimentary money-management skills. “If you make less than $10 million a year and have purchased one of our products, then we want to help you learn how to make less stupid financial decisions moving forward,” said Peloton in the statement. “You should be burning calories, not your savings, and our helpful new finance classes will show you how to do just that.”  Peloton has already released more than a dozen of the courses to their platform, with titles like “Real Bikes Are Only, Like, $100 on Craigslist And You Can Actually Get Places With Them,” “Why You Shouldn’t Spend A Month’s Wages On What’s Basically An Exercise Bike With A TV Taped To It,” and “Seriously, It Doesn’t Even Work Your Upper Body—What Were You Thinking?!?” And just like with Peloton’s fitness classes, the finance classes are gamified, allowing users with piss-poor credit scores and mountains of Visa debt to compete to determine who is less of a dipshit when it comes to money. The company promises that these virtual contests will be incredibly fun—and also educational!—for morons who are willing to pay the price of an actual gym membership every month to stream videos of people yelling at them. Amazing! It’s so refreshing to see a company care so much about serving its customers needs. Kudos to Peloton for going above and beyond to make sure that the financially brain-dead individuals who buy their products never make the same mistake again!"
Give It A Shot: Quarantine Might Be A Good Time To Punch A Big Hole In Your Wall And Dig Around In There,N/A,https://clickhole.com/give-it-a-shot-quarantine-might-be-a-good-time-to-punch-a-big-hole-in-your-wall-and-dig-around-in-there/,"Listen, we know bloggers and lifestyle Instagrammers have already covered a lot of the distracting home projects like bread-baking and gardening that you can start doing if you’re bored during quarantine, but we just thought of another one that might be worth a shot: maybe quarantine would be a good time to punch a big hole in your wall and dig around in there. Why not, right? It’s something to do. Whether you live in an apartment or a house, there can be all kinds of fascinating things in your walls — dead mice, living mice, insulation, maybe even some cash someone hid in there a hundred years ago. So if you’ve always wondered what your walls might be hiding, now is probably the ideal time to just wind up, punch a huge hole in one, and see where that takes you. You’ve got plenty of free hours to burn right now, so it really can’t hurt to fill a few of them up by bashing in one of your walls and then taking a good look at all the beams and wires and whatnot that it has inside. Sure, it can be stressful and frustrating being stuck in quarantine, but what if you thought of it as a valuable opportunity to delve into the mysterious inner workings of your home’s walls?  Give it a go! It could be a great way to make use of your time, especially if you’ve already tried everything else! You’ve probably exhausted a lot of your main options for fun, engaging indoor activities over the past weeks, but we figure one thing you haven’t done is checked to see if your wall and your neighbor’s wall actually connect directly to one another, which is something you can find out about by punching a hole right through your wall and checking to see if you can see your neighbor’s house on the other side. It’s pretty easy, and it might be fun and interesting! You and your neighbor can wave to each other through the hole, and once the pandemic’s over you could probably even shake hands through the hole. Could be cool! Well, we think all this is probably reason enough to just try punching a hole in your wall and see if it makes you feel any better, or even just different. Is there any good reason not to? You don’t have that many other options. Just try it, and make sure to let us know how it goes!"
A Fucking Boss: This Badass Baby Just Threw His Cup,N/A,https://clickhole.com/a-fucking-boss-this-badass-baby-just-threw-his-cup/,"For most people, respect is something that must be earned, but here’s a story of someone throwing around some serious big-dick energy and proving that, actually, respect is something you just stand up and fucking take: this badass baby just threw his cup. Goddamn. Little dude’s on some serious kingpin shit!  Earlier today, one-year-old Ryder Clark established himself as the undisputed alpha of his home when he spent five minutes shrieking and begging his mom for juice and then, as soon as she handed him a sippy cup full of it, just chucked the cup halfway across the kitchen without even taking a fucking sip. Though his pediatrician recently marked his weight at 26 pounds, it’s clear that Ryder is hiding two-ton balls of steel in his diaper, as it definitely takes some next-level swagger for a baby to totally demoralize his own mommy by spiking his Spider-Man cup right in her face As his mom and dad scrambled to grab paper towels and clean up the mess he’d made, Ryder sat there clapping his hands with a shit-eating grin on his face, clearly delighted at the sight of other people stooping before him and doing his dirty work. And if he hadn’t already made it perfectly clear who the fucking boss was, the chunky little guy then casually took off his shirt and proceeded to punch the pile of scrambled eggs on his highchair tray that his mom had just fixed him for breakfast, making a big mess.   Ryder’s dad, foolishly under the impression that he’s the one in charge, tried to assert his authority by putting the child down for a nap, but this plan immediately backfired. Within seconds of being tucked in, Ryder stood up in his crib, tossed all his blankets and stuffed animals to the floor, and began shrieking in the loudest, most annoying way imaginable. When his mom rushed in to try to calm him down by singing a lullaby, he made it crystal fucking clear that he’s the one who calls the shots, repeatedly smacking her mouth with both hands while screaming “QUIET! QUIET!”  This baby seriously takes no prisoners. God, what a badass.  There’s no question that Ryder has ice water running through his veins, as he is now standing up in his crib, jumping up and down and screaming “Juice!” once again as though the cup incident never happened. What’s impressive about this is, knowing how he operates, he’s almost definitely going to get what he wants. The kid just plays by his own rules and makes sure everyone else falls in line. We wish the best of luck to Ryder’s parents—this baby is a strong-willed bastard who simply cannot be contained, and there’s just not much you can do but keep dutifully changing his poopy diapers and trying to keep him happy, knowing damn well you’re utterly powerless to his whims.

‘Grow Up And Get A Life’: Timothée Chalamet Has Threatened To Retire From Acting If The 30-Year-Old Internet People Who Are Obsessed With Him Don’t Cut That Shit Out ASAP,N/A,https://clickhole.com/grow-up-and-get-a-life-timothee-chalamet-has-threatened-to-retire-from-acting-if-the-30-year-old-internet-people-who-are-obsessed-with-him-dont-cut-that-shit-out-asap/,"If you’re a Timothée Chalamet fan, you’d better listen up, because the actor has just issued a pretty serious ultimatum about the future of his career: Timothée Chalamet has threatened to retire from acting if the 30-year-old internet people who are obsessed with him don’t cut that shit out ASAP. Wow. It looks like he’s definitely not joking around here. Earlier this morning, the Call Me By Your Name star posted a video to his Instagram where he made the following announcement: Alright, I’m just gonna come out and say it: if you’re some 32-year-old blogger who’s always tweeting about how you “stan” me or whatever the fuck, you’ve got to stop that shit ASAP, or I am going to quit Hollywood for good. You people are freaking me the fuck out. You shouldn’t be in your 30’s and tweeting shit like, “good night to Timothée Chalamet only,” or commenting “omg I’m SCREAMING” on my Instagrams within 15 fucking seconds of me uploading them because you have notifications turned on for my posts. You’re an adult, for crying out loud. You should be starting a family! I can’t believe I need to say this, but you need to grow up and get a life. Do you think it’s normal for a full grown person to spend all day online explaining how I may look young but I’m actually 24, so it’s fine to be attracted to me? How the fuck don’t you realize how uncomfortable that makes me feel? I’ve got a bunch of media dweebs 10 years older than me following my every move. Imagine how fucking unsettling that is. I wouldn’t wish it on my worst enemy. You guys are always getting into conversations with each other about how hot I am, too. First of all, how the fuck do you all know each other? Did you all meet at a convention for the World’s Lamest 30 Year Olds? Well, consider this your wake up call. Stop retweeting pictures of me and saying that you ‘want Timothée to [redacted] your [redacted].’ Don’t tweet out the goddamn peach scene from ‘Call Me By Your Name’ and say that you wish you were the peach. And for the love of God, stop watching grainy YouTube videos of me rapping in my fucking high school talent show. I know you’re watching that shit on repeat, and it’s fucking alarming. You’re an adult. You should be working on your career or paying a mortgage, not watching videos of me from when I was a teenager. Goddamn. Look, if you’re my fan and you’re like 15, sure, go ahead and run a Twitter account called, like, “Timothée Chalamet Updates,” but if you’re 30, or even approaching it, you better not even follow those kinds of pages. I’ve already got enough money from this acting shit to retire, so don’t think I won’t do it. That’s right: no more movies where I play a brooding bad boy. No more scenes where I flip my hair and stare longingly into the distance. No more of my red carpet appearances where I look like a gas station worker in my little jumpsuit. You’re playing with fire here. I’m gonna take it all away if you don’t start acting like normal adults right this fucking minute. It’s time you grow up. Damn. It looks like this is an issue that has been bothering Timothée for quite some time. We can’t be sure if or when he’ll take action, but if his message applies to you, you might want to do as he says. The fate of his career could be in your hands."
What’s The Angle Here? Your Old High School Teacher Keeps Reposting A Viral Photo Of A Black Man And A White Man Wearing The Same Shirt As Though That’s Some Sort Of Comment On What’s Going On Right Now,N/A,https://clickhole.com/whats-the-angle-here-your-old-high-school-teacher-keeps-reposting-a-viral-photo-of-a-black-man-and-a-white-man-wearing-the-same-shirt-as-though-thats-some-sort-of-comment-on-what/,"In the month since the horrific murder of George Floyd, we’ve seen an unprecedented number of Americans take to social media to speak out against police brutality and demand justice. While this has been an overwhelmingly positive development in the fight for racial justice in America, it’s clear that some people still haven’t figured out how to effectively wield social media for the cause. Case in point: one of your old high school teachers keeps reposting a viral photo of a Black man and a white man wearing the same shirt as though that’s some sort of comment on what’s going on right now. Huh. Not quite sure what sort of angle she’s getting at here, but okay. Over the past month, your high school music teacher, a now-retired white woman in her late 60s, has on no fewer than three occasions gone on her personal Facebook page to share the baffling photo, which depicts two totally regular-looking guys—one white, one Black—standing side by side in matching T-shirts that say “FUN IN THE SUN” on the front. The men aren’t hugging or making any kind of profound gesture of racial unity or anything. They’re just standing there smiling and doing absolutely nothing that could possibly be perceived as a statement on racism in the U.S.   Hmm. You have to assume that your old teacher saw lots of other people posting about race on Facebook recently and felt a need to contribute to the dialogue, although the only conceivable point she could be making with the photo she keeps posting is…that white people and Black people can wear the same clothes? Like, what the fuck does she think the post is commenting on? Oppression? Shirts? Having a nice time in the sun? It doesn’t seem like she quite understands what all the protests have been about.  In her most recent post, your teacher shared the photo with the comment “This.” plus a flexing muscle emoji, which suggests that maybe the fact that the two men are wearing the same outfit is proof of racial equality in her mind. She clearly thought the post was significant in some way, because she then tagged her husband in the comments of the post and wrote “take a look” as if it were some kind of thought-provoking point in a larger conversation. It’s possible she simply thought that the very sight of two men of different races in the same shirt would act as a balm for racial tensions in the country, which obviously would be a major stretch. However, it does seem that it might have had that exact effect, as one of her Facebook friends commented “Preach!” under the post, and in addition to seven likes, three people reacted by clicking the heart emoji in enthusiastic support of whatever the hell point was being made. We’re really at a loss here. What could she possibly be getting at? It is certainly a bit unsettling to see this woman, whose job was literally to nurture the critical thinking skills of children, struggle so mightily to make a cogent comment on the current historical moment in this country. Even posting something as simple as the words “Black Lives Matter” would’ve been so much more productive, but apparently she’s under the impression that a photo of two smiling men in matching shirts speaks volumes about race in America. You’ve got to assume that her intentions are good, but here’s hoping she’ll at least put her money where her mouth is and donate to some worthy causes in support of whatever point she thinks she’s making, because unfortunately her Facebook posts are doing jackshit.

Absolutely Beautiful: The Caretaker’s In This Man’s Nursing Home Gave Him A Glove Taped To An Incredibly Long Stick So He Could Spank His Son And Grandson During Quarantine,N/A,https://clickhole.com/absolutely-beautiful-the-caretakers-in-this-mans-nursing-home-gave-him-a-glove-taped-to-an-incredibly-long-stick-so-he-could-spank-his-son-and-grandson-during-quarantine/,"The COVID-19 pandemic has been hitting elderly people especially hard. On top of facing increased health risks from the virus, seniors in nursing homes have also been suffering from loneliness and isolation because they’re no longer able to see their families. But one nursing home staff did something for one of their residents that’s absolutely going to warm your heart: The caretakers in this man’s nursing home gave him a glove taped to an incredibly long stick so he could spank his son and grandson during quarantine! How beautiful! It’s so amazing to see people work together to help a lonely old man stay connected with his family during such a difficult time! Before the coronavirus began wreaking havoc across the globe, 76-year-old Walter Bruce used to get visits from his 48-year-old son Richard and his 9-year-old grandson Colton every single week. During these visits, Walter would bend his son and grandson over his knee and spank them for all the misbehaving they had done so that they would both grow up right, and it never failed to boost his spirits. And if losing these visits to the pandemic weren’t hard enough for Walter already, Richard and Colton started coming by during quarantine to taunt him through his window, mooning him and laughing at him while he banged on the glass and screamed, “Damn you to Hell! I’ll kill you!” It just wasn’t the same, and Walter began feeling more and more depressed. Walter’s caretakers at the nursing home noticed how despondent he’d become, so they surprised him by attaching a rubber glove filled with marbles to the end of a 30-foot-long stick and giving it to him as a gift! Now Walter can remain indoors and spank his son and grandson from a safe distance while they bend over in the parking lot. According to his caretakers, Walter’s spanking stick has done wonders to improve his mood. Nearly every day, Walter’s son calls him on the phone and says, “Guess what, old man? Me and my boy have been causing mischief all over town and there’s nothing you can do about it!” and Walter yells back, “You son of a bitch! Drive yourself over to the parking lot and prepare for the spanking of a lifetime.” Then Walter’s son and grandson drive over to the nursing home and bend over in the parking lot, at which point Walter begins gleefully smacking them on their backsides from the safety of his bedroom with his glove on a stick. Richard and Colton yell, “We’re sorry! We’re sorry!” over and over while Walter yells, “This’ll teach you, you goddamn bastards!” and slaps them repeatedly on their exposed buttocks until Richard and Colton, feeling remorseful and sore, tearfully return to their car and go home, having been properly punished for their misbehavior.  Um, anyone else getting a little misty-eyed right now? People like Walter’s nurses are the true heroes of this pandemic! “When I found out I couldn’t spank them anymore, I was so afraid they were going to misbehave without any discipline and grow up to play guitar like the degenerate boys in The Replacements,” says Walter. “But now with my spanking stick, I can give my delinquent son and rebellious grandson all the beatings they need to grow up to be good and decent Americans. It’s not the same as bending them over my knee in person, but it’s certainly better than not getting to hear them squeal in pain at all.” It doesn’t get more heartwarming than this! In dark times like these, it’s truly wonderful to see the amazing workers at this nursing home going out of their way to bring much-needed joy and purpose back into Walter’s life. We hope Walter makes many happy memories spanking his son and grandson with his glove on a stick, and we can’t wait until this is all over so he can spank them in person once again!"
Time To Celebrate: The Doomsday Clock Has Been Set To Wine O’Clock,N/A,https://clickhole.com/time-to-celebrate-the-doomsday-clock-has-been-set-to-wine-oclock/,"With so much terrible, scary news bombarding us on a daily basis, the state of the world can seem pretty dire lately, but thankfully there’s a major bit of good news on the horizon that should fill everyone with hope and optimism: the official Doomsday Clock has just been set to Wine O’Clock! This is amazing! Time for everyone to grab a corkscrew and start celebrating! According to the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists, the group of academics responsible for setting the Doomsday Clock that tracks the globe’s proximity to total disaster, the international tensions currently plaguing the world have placed mankind on the brink of popping the cork on a bottle of rosé, climbing into a hot bubble bath, and just letting the booze do its thing. At this point, the scientists say, it is inevitable that we as a society will soon find ourselves getting tipsy in front of the TV while watching trashy reality television with our best friends. They say that while we could have avoided Wine O’Clock if we had come together to head it off months ago, now there’s no turning back, and we should brace ourselves for a future where we all have our slippers on and are sipping a chilled glass sauvignon blanc on our porch while we watch the sun set. Absolutely incredible! It’s wonderful to know that we as a society have consigned ourselves to a future of setting aside some serious Me time, dancing like nobody’s watching, and singing like nobody’s listening! “Now more than ever, humanity is confronted with the crucial challenge of finding a comfortable spot by a roaring fire, taking a load off, and indulging in the complex pleasures offered by a large glass of vino,” the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists wrote in an official statement on their website explaining their unprecedented decision. “World leaders can no longer ignore the inescapable fact that it’s time for all of us to treat ourselves to a whole pint of ice cream and just totally de-stress. We as a species need to come to terms with the fact that sunsets are proof that endings can be beautiful. Wine O’Clock is upon us, and so we have no choice but to issue the following message to all of humankind: we hope you dance.” Wow. This is definitely the best news we’ve heard about the Doomsday Clock in a long time! While humanity might one day find itself back on the brink of complete annihilation, it’s great to know that for now, it’s Wine O’Clock, and we can all get comfortable in front of the fire and let our worries dissolve into a soothing glass of our vintage of choice. We can’t wait to see what the Doomsday Clock has in store for us next!"

‘We Have A Plan’: The Pentagon Has Just Announced What It Will Do If There’s A 50-Foot-Tall Lumberjack Guy Wandering Around,N/A,https://clickhole.com/we-have-a-plan-the-pentagon-has-just-announced-what-it-will-do-if-theres-a-50-foot-tall-lumberjack-guy-wandering-around/,"From terrorism, to cyber attacks, to global warming, there is no shortage of things that keep Americans up at night. But every once in a while we are reminded that there are in fact people looking out for us and making sure we stay safe: the Pentagon has just announced what it will do if there’s a 50-foot-tall Lumberjack Guy wandering around. Awesome! “If there is a 50-foot-tall Lumberjack Guy roaming around America, we will be prepared. We have a plan,“ said Gen. Mark A. Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. “Americans should rest easy knowing that we will not just allow some massive Lumberjack Guy to stumble around this great country unopposed.” Wow. The plan itself is currently classified, but leaked reports indicate the Pentagon’s plan involves using a stack of pancakes to lure the 50-Foot-Tall Lumberjack Guy into a large field. Once there, a team of Navy Seals will tie a series of ropes around his massive ankles while he is occupied with the pancakes, thus rendering the Lumberjack Guy completely neutralized. Then an air horn will be blown, causing the Lumberjack Guy to become startled and try to run away. The Lumberjack Guy will trip over the ropes and fall to the ground, at which point he will be dosed with a sedative before he is taken to a secret military facility to be dissected. This is seriously great news. If a 50-foot-tall Lumberjack Guy was allowed to wander around America, there’s just no telling what kind of damage he might cause. And if he is carrying a massive axe, which he likely would be — well, we don’t even want to think about it. Thankfully, the Pentagon is ready. But if the plan doesn’t work? “If our initial plan does not work, we will have no choice but to cut off his head with a laser,” Milley says. “Regardless, we are ready for the 50-foot-tall Lumberjack Guy, and if he has some sort of large blue pet as well, we are ready for that too.” Yep. You can feel free to exhale now. Thank you to the Pentagon for working so hard to keep our nation safe from massive lumberjacks!"
A Slice Of Sicily! Mom Is Drinking Wine And Making Chicken Alfredo From A Box While Listening To That Music-Only TV Channel In the 400s That Plays Frank Sinatra Songs,N/A,https://clickhole.com/a-slice-of-sicily-mom-is-drinking-wine-and-making-chicken-alfredo-from-a-box-while-listening-to-that-music-only-tv-channel-in-the-400s-that-plays-frank-sinatra-songs/,"If you were craving an authentic Italian meal for dinner tonight, you’re in luck, because there’s an immersive culinary adventure beginning in the kitchen as we speak: Mom is drinking wine and making chicken alfredo from a box while listening to that music-only TV channel in the 400s that plays Frank Sinatra songs! Bellissimo! Mom has truly brought home a slice of Sicily for all to enjoy! As soon as she got back from the grocery store this afternoon, Mom all but transported herself to the coast of the Mediterranean Sea by pouring a glass of Little Penguin Pinot Grigio over ice and flipping to Music Choice Channel number 442 that plays a Frank Sinatra song every ten minutes or so. She then began swaying back and forth and humming along to “My Way” as she got the box of Banquet Chicken Alfredo going on the stove, filling the house with a cheesy scent so rich and delightful it’s difficult to believe that she’s in the suburbs of Pittsburgh and not in a pastificio near the Palermo beach. Mom didn’t stop cultivating the romantic European mood there, either: after giving the alfredo a careful stir, she poured a bag of pre-made salad with chunks of purple cabbage and iceberg lettuce into a big wooden bowl and topped it with Wishbone Italian dressing. Then, as the opening notes “Fly Me To The Moon” issued from the flat-screen television’s speakers, she placed the bowl on the table beside the green bottle of grated Kraft cheese and called it an “antipast with parmesan” in the Italian dialect she picked up from a waiter at a Venice restaurant on a day-trip stop off on the Carnival Cruise she took with her husband for her 50th birthday! The waiter’s name was Pasquale! Having finished sprinkling garlic powder onto frozen Wonder bread like it’s a secret family recipe passed down from generation to generation, Mom then pulled out a candelabra from Halloween in the hutch and lit its taper candles to set the mood, making the whole place feel like a quiet, romantic cafe situated on a quiet cobblestone street just off the piazza. Now she’s giving herself a moment to take it all in by closing her eyes, leaning back on the counter, and tilting the wine around in her glass with the precision of a sommelier who trained for years in the vineyards of Tuscany! But the night isn’t merely about cuisine – it’s a celebration of culture, too. That’s why Mom just paused her dinner preparations for a minute to carefully read the fun fact about Frank Sinatra that’s popped on the Music Choice Channel’s screensaver, which says, “Did you know? The members of The Rat Pack did not refer to themselves as ‘The Rat Pack.’” It’s clear that she’s committing it to memory so she can share it during dinner as though it’s essential wisdom she learned from her Nonna during her childhood summers in Naples, and we can’t wait for her to regale us with her knowledge!  This is just spectacular! Mom has recreated the incredible tastes and sounds of Italy in her house, and we couldn’t be more impressed! Tonight’s meal is going to be a dinner to remember. Buon appetito, Mom! "
"Making Multiple Trips, Apparently: God Just Raptured The Arms Of Humanity’s Faithful But Nothing Else",N/A,https://clickhole.com/making-multiple-trips-apparently-god-just-raptured-the-arms-of-humanitys-faithful-but-nothing-else/,"For over 2,000 years, Christians have awaited the glorious day described in the Bible when the faithful ascend to Heaven, and it looks like that day has finally come…sort of: God just raptured the arms of humanity’s faithful but nothing else.   Wow! Looks like He’s breaking the rapture up into several trips—smart thinking! Earlier today, hundreds of millions of Christians around the world loudly rejoiced as the skies parted above them to reveal a blinding white light, at which point their arms detached from their bodies and slowly floated up to the heavens at about two miles per hour. Believers everywhere—despite the unthinkable pain caused by having their arms pulled off—cried out in praise to the Lord Most High and futilely attempted to clap their hands out of muscle memory, eagerly welcoming Phase 1 of an apparently multi-part Second Coming, with God making the first of several trips down to mankind in a strategic effort to transport His followers to eternal paradise as efficiently as possible.  “Hark, all ye nations of man, for the rapture that has been prophesied shall now be accomplished!” bellowed an archangel from the clouds above in a voice like seven thunders, the sound of which caused many thousands of blasphemers and idolaters to combust in pillars of fire. “The hour has come for the King of Kings to retrieve the limbs of His servants whose names are carved in the Book of Life, as it would be too heavy to carry their whole persons up at once! The arms shall join the Almighty in His heavenly court for one thousand years of jubilee, and then more parts of His faithful shall ascend thereafter. ” While initially confused, many prominent theologians have now confirmed that today’s extraordinary events are indeed consistent with how the Second Coming is foretold in the Bible, noting that scripture never explicitly specifies that Christians’ earthly bodies would be raptured in whole and that certain translations of verses in the books of Revelation and 1 Thessalonians allude to disciples of the Messiah “scurrying every which way without hands to raise in exaltation,” proclaiming “Hosanna unto He who had delivered a small portion of them from their earthly woes.” One version even mentions “men with heads sprouting as wheat from their groins,” which is believed to be a reference to those Christian amputees already lacking arms, who today saw their torsos raptured instead and were left with their necks sticking directly out of their pelvises.    Incredible! This is a truly glorious turn of events for Christians worldwide, although it’s definitely a huge bummer for those on Earth who still have arms, as this signals that they are likely destined for eternal torture in the fires of Hell. Yikes! How do you feel about the arms of God’s elect being raptured? Are you excited or not-so-excited for the end times? Let us know in the comments!"
A Piece Of History: The Gun JFK Shot Himself With After His Caption For A ‘New Yorker’ Cartoon Was Rejected Is Coming To The Smithsonian,N/A,https://clickhole.com/a-piece-of-history-the-gun-jfk-shot-himself-with-after-his-caption-for-a-new-yorker-cartoon-was-rejected-is-coming-to-the-smithsonian/,"The day that President John F. Kennedy died is one of the darkest days in American history, but now, for the first time ever, a piece of history from that fateful day will be put on display for the public to see: the gun JFK shot himself with after his caption for a New Yorker cartoon was rejected is coming to the Smithsonian. Wow. What an incredible artifact from a tragic day that the nation will never forget. Beginning next week, The Natural Museum of American History will be featuring the Smith & Wesson Model 36 revolver that JFK shot himself with upon learning that the New Yorker’s readers had not chosen his submission as the winning caption in the magazine’s November 1963 Cartoon Caption Contest. As a part of the exhibit commemorating the late President’s life, the Smithsonian will also feature the exact issue of the New Yorker that JFK read before he shot himself.  The exhibit will also feature the caption submitted by John F. Kennedy that earned him a spot as a finalist the week prior:  As seen in video footage from that tragic November day, as JFK rode beside his wife Jackie in the backseat of a Lincoln Continental convertible through the streets of Dallas, Texas, he started looking through the latest issue of the New Yorker. He flipped directly to the back of the magazine to the Cartoon Caption Contest page, where he discovered the news that would change the course of history forever.  Americans will never forget the look of total devastation in JFK’s face as he saw that he hadn’t won the contest and started repeating, “I just can’t believe it. I just can’t believe it.” He threw the magazine down to the car’s floor as his heartbreak deepened. “You’ve got to be kidding me. I’ve worked so hard to get here, but this is proof that I’m never going to be good enough for the New Yorker.” He buried his head in his hands. Anyone who was in Dallas that day will remember the booming sounds of JFK’s uncontrollable sobs and the agony in his voice as he screamed, “What’s the point of it all? Of course mine didn’t win. I’m a total fuck up. All I’ve ever wanted was to win the caption contest, and I can’t even fucking do that right. I’m an embarrassment to everyone I know. What was I thinking? Obviously I don’t belong in the same magazine that publishes Dorothy Parker and J.D. Salinger. I don’t belong in the New Yorker. Hell, I don’t even belong on this Earth.” Although many sources report that Jackie tried calming the hyperventilating JFK down by reminding him that he had been a finalist, which is a lot farther than most people make it, there was no getting through to him. He unbuckled his seatbelt, lunged toward his Secret Service agent sitting in the driver’s seat, and grabbed the gun from his holster. He held the revolver to his head as he yelled, “I’D RATHER BE DEAD THAN BE A RUNNER-UP IN THE CAPTION CONTEST,” and pulled the trigger.  Those heartbreaking last words would be etched into the memories of every American for the rest of time. Rest in peace, JFK. Anyone interested in experiencing this solemn exhibit honoring the late President’s untimely death should start planning their trip to Washington, D.C. ASAP, because this is definitely a once-in-a-lifetime exhibit that history buffs won’t want to miss. "
"Last Hurrah: SeaWorld Has Agreed To Release All Of Their Animals Into The Wild, But First They’re Putting On A No-Holds-Barred, 12-Hour Show Where Absolutely Anything Goes",N/A,https://clickhole.com/last-hurrah-seaworld-has-agreed-to-release-all-of-their-animals-into-the-wild-but-first-theyre-putting-on-a-no-holds-barred-12-hour-show-where-absolutely-anything-goes/,"Get excited, animal lovers, because some news just broke that will likely cement today as a historic day for animal rights: Following years of public uproar, SeaWorld has officially announced that they’re going to release all their animals into the wild, although they’re going to put on one last no-holds-barred, 12-hour show where absolutely anything goes. Yes! After 12 hours of brutal nonstop mayhem, these majestic animals will finally be able to live free in their rightful home in the wild. SeaWorld revealed the news in a post on their official Facebook page this morning:  At SeaWorld, we are dedicated to the wellbeing of our animals, but we’re also dedicated to entertaining our guests with spectacular, high-octane performances starring the most powerful and deadly beasts of the sea.Those two competing values have led us to the decision to release all of our majestic aquatic animals into the ocean where they belong, but only after pitting them against one another in one final, glorious, shrieking shitshow of aquatic chaos in which only the strongest will survive. During this 12-hour orgy of dizzying violence, we will wring every last drop of lowbrow excitement out of our collection of marine life.  We’re going to be doing some real Evel Knievel shit with sea turtles on motorcycles. We’re going to replace all the saltwater in the tanks with booze and caffeine. Can a dolphin survive a harrowing gauntlet of hungry sharks, whirring blades, and pyrotechnics? Who cares! We’re trying it. Did you know you can light water on fire if you put enough gas in it? Well, you can. And we’re going to do that, too. And you know Grave Digger, the monster truck? Well, imagine that baby launching over a lineup of 10 orcas as fireworks explode in the sky above. From sunup to sundown, we are going all out today, baby! We’re going to shave a bear and throw it in the fucking dolphin tank and claim it’s a new species of dolphin. Fuck you. This is the last fucking day on Earth here at Sea World, and we are doing it big. We’re gonna get a big pile of electric eels and have them electrocute a horse until it explodes. We’re gonna have monkeys riding whales. We’re gonna shoot penguins from cannons. Any man, woman, or child who feels up to it will be allowed to hop in the tank and fist fight a sea lion. It’s gonna be insane, folks, and it’s all happening today. Come see these wonderful, intelligent marine animals one more time before we let them off into the wild. Wow! Kudos to SeaWorld for finally committing to releasing their animals, and props to them, as well, for pulling out all the stops to delight their paying customers with one truly show-stopping animal battle royale for the ages. Here’s hoping that the animals who make it out alive today go on to enjoy long and happy lives in the wild.  "

Sweet dreams, Martin! See you in October! At 5 o’clock this morning, the iconic film director held an impromptu press conference in the road in front of his house to announce that he had just eaten a large meal of lunch meat and barbecue sauce to build up his fat reserves and would soon be entering his annual period of vegetative stasis for the next several months.  “I need to sleep so I can have energy to come up with more funny movies about mafia boys,” the legendary director explained while urinating on the asphalt to “clear out [his] tubes for the big snooze.” “Do not wake me up. I have booby-trapped my house with grenades and snakes to make sure no one comes near me. If you try to come near me, we will all die.” Scorsese then led the small crowd of paparazzi that had gathered in a recitation of the Lord’s Prayer, after which he took off all his clothes except his black dress shoes and wandered back into his house to attend to final preparations, including climbing inside his refrigerator for several minutes to lower his body temperature for energy conservation purposes and shoving a Pepsi can up his anus to keep bugs from crawling in there while he’s unconscious. Once ready, he flopped face-down on the floor and slithered underneath his living room couch, where he then nestled himself into a cozy bed of sticks, litter, and scraps of Hanukkah-themed wrapping paper he’d foraged to shelter himself during dormancy. Moments later, he began snoring intensely. The 77-year-old director has hibernated every year since 1981, when he was so frightened by John Hinkley Jr.’s assassination attempt on President Reagan that he hid under his couch for seven months until he finally felt it was safe to come out. He found sleeping through spring and summer to be incredibly restorative and has since been an outspoken proponent of hibernation, despite the fact that he nearly dies from starvation every single time. Scorsese remains in hibernation each year until Halloween, when the constant racket of trick-or-treaters ringing the doorbell stirs him from his slumber and he emerges from underneath the couch looking gaunt and confused, typically weighing no more than 80 pounds due to extreme weight loss.  This is so cool! Martin Scorsese’s hibernation is such a breathtaking process to witness! It’s a grueling process for a senior citizen to endure, but if 2019’s stellar The Irishman is any indication, hibernation truly does seem to be keeping him at the top of his game. Here’s hoping Scorsese can once again make it through a season of stasis without dying and that he wakes up on Halloween teeming with creative energy. Good luck, Martin!"
Heartbreaking: The Kind Of Nice Thing That This Guy’s Friend Just Mindlessly Said About Him In Passing Is Going To Be A Central Pillar Of His Self-Esteem For The Rest Of His Life,N/A,https://clickhole.com/heartbreaking-the-kind-of-nice-thing-that-this-guys-friend-just-mindlessly-said-about-him-in-passing-is-going-to-be-a-central-pillar-of-his-self-esteem-for-the-rest-of-his-life/,"Brace yourself, because this is an incredibly sad story that will only become more depressing as time goes on: the kind of nice thing that this guy’s friend just mindlessly said about him in passing is going to be a central pillar of his self-esteem for the rest of his life. Yikes. It doesn’t get much more pathetic than this. Twenty-eight year old Josh Massey’s friend Mike probably barely even notice that he just absentmindedly called Josh “a fun guy” during a casual conversation over beers, but sadly enough, that tossed-off comment is going to be one of the main things keeping Josh afloat emotionally for the remainder of his days. Josh’s heart soared immediately upon hearing Mike’s remark, and moments later he excitedly asked “Do you really think so?” to a confused Mike, who had already forgotten what he had just said. And unfortunately, Josh was on cloud nine for hours after leaving the bar at the end of the night, smiling to himself as he remembered that Mike had designated him as someone who’s good to hang out with. Good god. This guy was really starving for some positive attention, huh? Despite the fact that Mike throws around the phrase “fun guy” pretty regularly to describe just about anybody, the statement has already made Josh’s month, and will continue to buoy his self-esteem for years to come. You can be pretty sure that Josh will be making a note of it in his journal tonight, and it won’t be long before the page he writes it on is wrinkled and worn from all the times he’s looked back on it to remind himself of his worth. Years from now, going through a devastating breakup and feeling totally alone in the world, Josh will tell himself, “at least Mike thinks I’m fun,” having no idea that Mike basically wasn’t paying any attention to what he was saying when he let that comment slip. The statement will effectively become Josh’s personal mantra in a way that Mike could not possibly have intended it to — a truly heartbreaking state of affairs for all involved. Yeah, this is pretty hard to watch. He was obviously just saying that to say it, dude. You can bet good money that 20 years from now when Mike has forgotten who Josh even is, Josh will still be remembering the time Mike said that he was a fun guy, and that’s about as sad a situation as we can imagine. It’s probably a good thing that Josh will never know how little that comment meant to Mike — because it will likely be one of the only things keeping Josh going from now on."
"Oh Great, The Fog Is Here: It Is Now Very Foggy On Top Of Everything Else",N/A,https://clickhole.com/oh-great-the-fog-is-here-it-is-now-very-foggy-on-top-of-everything-else/,"Ugh. Just…Ugh. As if there wasn’t already enough bleakness, uncertainty, and full-blown panic going on in the world today, things just took yet another turn for the worse. It is now foggy on top of everything else. Fucking Christ. No two ways about it, the fog is here to decrease visibility, make things humid, and make outside look dreary. There hasn’t been much hope in the air lately, but no one expected a gut punch like it becoming foggy. Now, cars must drive slower, it is harder to see things in the distance, and it is less sunny. Dear God, what have we done to deserve fog at a time like this? Why are we being punished with this dreary air? Many of us were close to our breaking points as it was. How can we carry on through all the madness and suffering in the world now that we’ve also got to deal with the fog? No one knows for sure how long it will be foggy, but forecasts are saying at least a few hours, if not more. Humanity has dealt with fog before, but not at a time like this. It remains to be seen how well we can handle it, but hopefully is the resilience and spirit that has gotten us through wars, famine, plagues, and disasters will help us get through the fog. Buckle up, folks. The fog is here."
Heartbreaking: This Man Has Been Working For Weeks Under The Impression That He’s An Essential Worker,N/A,https://clickhole.com/heartbreaking-this-man-has-been-working-for-weeks-under-the-impression-that-hes-an-essential-worker/,"Though millions of workers across the country are courageously working during the COVID-19 pandemic to provide life-sustaining services to their communities, one man seems tragically mistaken about his role in society: this man has been working for weeks under the impression that he’s an essential worker. Just heartbreaking. This poor guy obviously thinks he has a duty to be working right now, even though what he does for work is utterly pointless. Although this man’s job is completely nonessential, he has been working every single day throughout the entire pandemic, clearly operating under the mistaken assumption that he’s providing a crucial service that people depend on. Seeing that his job is basically just filming himself talking about the news and singing wacky songs, it’s strange that he doesn’t realize how useless his efforts are to society at large, as no one in their right mind could ever construe what he does as important. Honestly, it’s hard to imagine people appreciating his ridiculous antics even during normal times, let alone during one the greatest crises the world has ever experienced, and certainly no one would ever mistake him for a hero. It’s as if he thinks that he’s on the same level as a doctor or a grocery store worker, and that broadcasting Zoom calls with C-list celebrities is going to save lives or something.  Go figure! While everyone’s got their own unique way of coping during this pandemic, the manner in which this guy’s going about it just doesn’t seem healthy. Clearly he’s delusional as to the value he brings to the world around him, and it’s hard not to feel for someone who is clearly falling apart. Here’s hoping that someone close to him gently lets him know that he doesn’t need to make videos of himself being silly every single day and that it’d be much better—and safer—for him to just keep to himself and work on getting back in touch with reality."
Complete Betrayal: This Woman Just Found Out Her Husband Of 20 Years Isn’t Really Mr. Smee,N/A,https://clickhole.com/complete-betrayal-this-woman-just-found-out-her-husband-of-20-years-isnt-really-mr-smee/,"Here’s a story about a woman whose whole world was turned upside down when she learned someone wasn’t who they claimed to be: This woman just found out her husband of 20 years isn’t really Mr. Smee.  Wow. What a devastating betrayal. For 20 years, 52-year-old Rachel Fierston thought she had a fairytale marriage with the man of her dreams – Captain Hook’s trusted first mate, Mr. Smee. He would delight her with stories about his adventures sailing the Seven Seas with Captain Hook and his run-ins with Peter Pan in Neverland, but last month, everything capsized when Rachel made the shocking discovery that her husband wasn’t Mr. Smee at all, but merely an imposter who had posed as Captain Hook’s chubby, clumy sidekick in order to win Rachel’s heart. Rachel made the horrible discovery about her husband’s true identity when she rented a boat for an afternoon to celebrate her husband’s birthday. Rachel was sure that her husband would love spending the day sailing out on the water, showing off all the boating skills he had learned while sailing with Captain Hook and doing battle with the Lost Boys in Neverland. However, once they were on the ship, it became immediately clear that her husband had absolutely no idea how to sail the boat. “The second we walked onto the ship, he started claiming he left his ‘Pirate License’ at home, and wouldn’t be allowed to sail it,” explained Rachel. “But he was panicking, and it was obvious that he just didn’t know how to sail. I started to question him on it. ‘Don’t you spend every day out on the water with Captain Hook?’” Rachel reports that her husband grew increasingly anxious as she pressed him for answers, and after she asked, “Would Captain Hook even recognize you if we ran into him on the street?” he broke down into tears and revealed their whole marriage had been a sham: his real name was Bill DeMarco, and despite what his round pink nose, rotund belly, and little half-moon spectacles suggested, no, he was not really Mr. Smee.  Just heartbreaking. It must be so hard to have your life upended like this. Rachel has since filed for divorce, but she admits that the split hasn’t been easy. “The rug has been completely pulled out from under me,” Rachel explained. “Every morning, he would pack up a knapsack full of ropes, swords, compasses – all types of pirate stuff – and head out for the day. I thought he was spending it aboard the Jolly Roger beside Captain Hook, but it turns out he was just at an accounting firm.” “I spent 20 years thinking I was in love with a man who was second in command to the world’s greatest pirate, only to learn that he’d never even met him,” Rachel lamented. “It just goes to show that even if someone wears a red cap and blue striped shirt like Mr. Smee and bumbles around like Mr. Smee, it still might not be the real Mr. Smee.” Just tragic. Here’s hoping Rachel finds a new relationship full of honesty sometime soon!"
‘That’s Why Their Heads Were So Large And Misshapen’: The Creators Of ‘Rugrats’ Just Revealed That They Made The Babies Look That Way To Show What Happens If You Vaccinate Your Children,N/A,https://clickhole.com/thats-why-their-heads-were-so-large-and-misshapen-the-creators-of-rugrats-just-revealed-that-they-made-the-babies-look-that-way-to-show-what-happens-if-yo/,"Get excited, ‘90s kids, because here’s some seriously awesome news about one of the greatest Nicktoons of all-time: The creators of Rugrats just revealed that they made the babies look that way to show what happens if you vaccinate your children. Wow! This is such an amazing insight into one of the best Nicktoons ever! In a statement released earlier today, Arlene Klasky and Gábor Csupó, the duo behind the wildly popular ‘90s cartoon, confirmed that the show’s baby characters were intentionally designed with disturbingly large, misshapen heads and much smaller, underdeveloped bodies in order to depict the grave consequences of subjecting kids to vaccines. Klasky and Csupó explained that details such as Chuckie’s chronic sickliness and Phil and Lil’s “severely autistic demeanor” were included in the show as a way of alerting parents to the dangers of going against God’s plan and introducing toxic manmade inoculations into a child’s body, noting that the babies only got into so many harrowing scrapes because the mercury in their influenza shots stunted development in the part of their brains that regulates high-risk behaviors.   “Viewers always seemed to think of Tommy as a courageous character, but the sad reality is that harmful vaccines left him with the emotional intelligence of a pigeon, and, with essentially zero capacity to recognize danger, he honestly would’ve crawled smiling into a house fire if he got the chance,” the statement read, adding that this was also the reason why he preferred to play with a screwdriver instead of normal toys. “Seeing these hydrocephalic, pigeon-toed infants eating dog food and having troubling hallucinations of the Reptar monster should’ve been deeply sobering for anyone who watched Rugrats, and our sole purpose in making the show was to help parents realize that vaccines are literally a form of biological warfare that we wage against our own children.” Fascinating! For kids who grew up in the ‘90s, these are some seriously exciting revelations, and in retrospect, Rugrats’ anti-vaxx themes should’ve been incredibly obvious all along. And while there’s still plenty of debate over whether vaccines are really as dangerous as the show’s creators claim, it’s hard not to look at Tommy Pickles—with his colossal, dented melon and alarmingly reckless behavior—and not think twice about innoculating your own kids. We’ll never watch Rugrats the same way again!"

Today, however, we are delighted to inform you that after countless trials and tribulations, our thousand years of dormancy are finally over, and ClickHole has awakened from its long slumber.  Amazing! Yes, it is true: Starting today, there will be new things to read on ClickHole.com.

WHERE CAN CLICKHOLE’S EPOCH-DEFINING VIDEOS BE FOUND? For the time being, all of ClickHole’s videos can be found on our YouTube channel. You can even find the long-absent Gatorade video there, which we had to take down for a while due to a BASELESS and SHAMEFUL lawsuit that we eventually resolved by paying a HEFTY SETTLEMENT. Our hope is that we will one day be able to resume making new wonderful videos for you to watch in the dark of your windowless, stink-filled hovels. When this day comes, we will call you on the telephone and let you know. WILL YOU PUT ON A FRIGHTENING WOLF MASK ON AND CHASE MY SCREAMING DAD AROUND THE KITCHEN IN ORDER TO MAKE HIM DO EXERCISE? No. That’s your mother’s job. WHERE IS CLICKHOLE’S BEAUTIFUL TREASURE? ClickHole’s world-famous treasure can be found here. ClickHole is proud to be the only website in the world with treasure.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: Our Computer Has Become Infested With Crickets And ClickHole Is Temporarily Going On Standby,N/A,https://clickhole.com/for-immediate-release-our-computer-has-become-infested-1841359759/,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: ClickHole.com is sad to announce that as of 9:30 a.m. CST this morning, the Hewlett-Packard desktop computer where we create all of our red-hot viral content has become infested with crickets. We will be unable to update the website until the problem is resolved. Here is how it happened: For the past six months, we have been spraying our Hewlett-Packard desktop computer with Axe Body Spray. We loved that it made our computer smell athletic and sexual. It motivated us to come into work, and we loved to breathe deep of the Axe fumes while we churned out content all day long. Unfortunately, the aroma of the Axe Body Spray also attracted enormous amounts of crickets, and now they are living in our computer. We called an exterminator and he estimated that there were “hundreds or thousands” of crickets inside our computer. Then he went home without helping us. Sadly, this is the only computer our website has. All of our employees share it and take turns clicking the mouse. Due to the cricket infestation on our only computer, we have no choice but to SUSPEND OPERATIONS OF CLICKHOLE.COM UNTIL THE PROBLEM IS RESOLVED AND THE CRICKETS ARE EITHER DEAD OR INFESTING A DIFFERENT WEBSITE’S COMPUTER. We promise to keep you updated as we attempt to rid our computer of crickets. We’ll be using a computer at the library to post on our social accounts and keep you informed about what’s going on with the crickets, so be sure to check our social media feeds RELIGIOUSLY in order to stay up to date on our pest control situation. The library computer does not have AOL, which is the type of internet we use to create ClickHole posts, so even though we can use the library computer to update our social media, we can’t make the site work until we get rid of the crickets on our desktop. As a final note to our readers: DO NOT BUY COMPUTERS FROM HEWLETT-PACKARD IF YOU DO NOT WANT CRICKETS TO INFEST YOUR DESKTOP. The exterminator said this was the “most crickets he’d ever seen in one place,” and he said that if the computer had been made by a better company, there would probably be only a few dozen crickets instead of the several hundred crickets we are currently dealing with. Thank you for continuing to be fanatically devoted to ClickHole.com. We promise to do everything we can to murder these insects and get back to posting the viral content you adore as soon as possible. Until then, keep reaching for the stars, and remember: With God on your side, anything is possible."
An Inequitable System: 90% Of People Appointed Car DJ Are Only Given The Job Because They’re Sitting Shotgun,N/A,https://clickhole.com/an-inequitable-system-90-of-people-appointed-car-dj-a-1841067424/,"As Americans, we like to believe that we live in a meritocratic society where individuals rise to the top based on talent and skill. But a new study has proven just how inequitable the world around us really is: Researchers have determined that 90% of people appointed car DJ are only given the job because they’re sitting shotgun. Just awful. Everyone in the car deserves a chance at being the car DJ, but it seems only a select few are getting that opportunity. A new study by the sociology department at UC Berkeley has found that nearly all of the people assigned the role of car DJ are only given the job because they’re sitting shotgun, rather than because their ability to queue up tunes surpasses that of the passengers seated elsewhere in the vehicle. The study specified that even in situations in which someone in the backseat is more up-to-date on music trends or has the most experience curating Spotify playlists, the person sitting shotgun is still typically chosen as DJ for the duration of the car trip for no reason other than their proximity to the aux cord. This is so unfair. A system that so clearly favors the person sitting shotgun is not a just system. Worse still, the study found that there is no evidence to suggest that the people sitting in the back of a given vehicle are any less likely to be able to keep chill jams coming than the person sitting up front. And as the Berkeley researchers point out, it’s also worth noting that shotgun is widely seen as the most coveted seat in the car due to its ample legroom and unobstructed view, so the fact that the person who sits there also gets to be car DJ all because they yelled “shotgun” before the other passengers only compounds an already-existing inequity. While the authors of the study admit that there are no clear solutions to remedy the unjust system they describe, they suggest that people sitting shotgun should be aware of the privileges that allowed them to become the car DJ and should regularly ask the backseat passengers if they have any requests. Wow. What an eye-opening study. Even though it’s far from fair, the truth is that your seat in the car plays a significant role in determining whether or not you’ll be the car DJ. Here’s hoping that someday soon we will live in a world where everyone in the car has an equal chance at being the one who gets to pick the music."
Incredibly Tragic: Everyone At This Trivia Table Wrongly Assumes At Least One Of Their Friends Is Still Having Fun,N/A,https://clickhole.com/incredibly-tragic-everyone-at-this-trivia-table-wrongl-1840535628/,"Brace yourself, because here’s a story about an upsetting situation currently unfolding at a trivia night in Baltimore, MD that is definitely going to bum you out: Everyone at this trivia table wrongly assumes at least one of their friends is still having fun. God, what a shame. Under the mistaken belief that others at their table are actually enjoying themselves, each member of this six-person trivia team at Lucky’s Pub is quietly suffering their way through the evening, tragically unaware that everyone else in their group is also bored as hell and would much rather be doing literally anything else. Tied for last place and guessing their way through questions on obscure topics that none of them know anything about, everyone at the table has been completely checked out for at least half an hour now, with all of them gulping down beer after overpriced beer to make the host’s annoying banter more tolerable, assuming that the rest of their friends are still really into it. Just heartbreaking. If only these guys would be honest with each other and admit that they’re having a terrible time, then they could all go home and go to bed. One might get the impression that Shannon’s having fun because she keeps enthusiastically volunteering to run their answer cards up to the scorekeeper, but the reality is that she’s really only doing this to break up the tedium of sitting around a table and futilely attempting to answer questions about presidents’ birthplaces or whatever. She’s really only sticking it out at this point as a courtesy to Evan, who she’s wrongly deduced is really invested in the game due to the fact that he’s nailing question after question on European geography, including a clutch 500-pointer on the location of the River Lagan. However, Evan’s only getting answers right because he studied abroad in Dublin and is generally familiar with Europe—he truly does not give a shit about the game itself, and all he wants to do is go home and get some sleep so he’s not hungover for work tomorrow. Also, everyone’s pretty embarrassed by their team name, Make Trivia Great Again, which Phil wrote down on the scorecard without bothering to run it past anyone else first. Really cringe-worthy shit, Phil. It’s just a brutal evening all around. Though it should be more obvious that not one of them is enjoying it because they’re all just sitting there emotionless while every other team whoops and cheers after every question, they’re still hanging in there out of a collective, misguided fear of being a buzzkill. The true buzzkill, of course, is being repeatedly forced to recall random shit you learned in high school history class while you’re simply trying to have a nice night out with your pals. Here’s hoping someone admits to being miserable soon, otherwise they’ll all have to endure five more rounds of shitty, boring trivia only to end the night with a humiliating last-place finish."
Heartbreaking: This Guy Has No Idea That He’s So Strange And Memorable-Looking That Everyone From His Flight Is Using Him As A Landmark To Figure Out Which Baggage Claim Area Is Theirs,N/A,https://clickhole.com/heartbreaking-this-guy-has-no-idea-that-he-s-so-strang-1840269339/,"Prepare to become a complete emotional wreck, because the story currently unfolding at Chicago’s O’Hare Airport is definitely a bummer: This guy has no idea that he’s so strange and memorable-looking that everyone from his flight is using him as a landmark to figure out which baggage claim area is theirs. Just tragic. Our hearts go out to this unfortunate soul. When the flight first boarded in Atlanta, a really tall, bald-headed man with a long black beard parked himself right next to the gate and started rocking back and forth in his large leather cowboy boots, creating a spectacle that was so massively weird and unsettling that it became permanently seared into the memories of every other passenger. Now that the flight has landed, the man is just minding his own business waiting for his bag to come around on the carousel, and it’s heartbreaking that he has absolutely no idea that dozens of people from his flight are now arriving in the baggage claim section, spotting his gigantic green fishing vest, and thinking, “Ah, there’s that guy,” and immediately heading over to the carousel where he’s standing without needing to check the LCD monitor to see where they should go. God. It’s so sad to see the man aggressively staring at the carousel with his leather-gloved hands on his hips, completely oblivious to the fact that the mandolin strapped to his back—which was his only carry-on item—is now a highly recognizable beacon calling everyone from his flight to the carousel where he’s standing. While this man had to read the monitor to discover for himself which baggage claim area to go to, he has no clue that everyone else figured it out by noticing his camouflage cut-off shorts with, like, eight pockets from 200 yards away. This is the officially the saddest story we’ve ever heard. The man still doesn’t even realize that a family that got off the flight right after him was able to follow his towering, hunchbacked body straight off the plane toward baggage claim without once looking up at the signs to know if they were going the right way. Hopefully this man never needs to learn that he looks so bizarre that he basically became a human landmark. If he discovered the truth, it would completely crush his spirit."
"Meh: This Woman Shared ‘Real’ Photos Of Her Post-Pregnancy Body To Start A Conversation About Imperfections, But We’ve Already Seen That A Bunch Of Times",N/A,https://clickhole.com/meh-this-woman-shared-real-photos-of-her-post-pregna-1840419087/,"The body positivity movement has done a ton of great work to start dialogues about society’s harmful beauty standards, and it’s amazing when a courageous woman stands up and starts an important discussion about society’s unfair beauty standards. Unfortunately, we’re starting to see the same important discussions happening again and again. Case in point: This woman shared real photos of her post-pregnancy body to start a conversation about imperfections, but we’ve already seen that a bunch of times. Meh. This sort of thing might have been absolutely incredible 10 years ago, but by now it feels sort of stale. Earlier this week, Marissa Salazar, a 36-year-old Nashville resident, tweeted out photos of her post-pregnancy body and wrote that it was time we started talking about how women’s bodies don’t always look like the airbrushed supermodels you see in magazines, which was an important, but ultimately repetitive point that’s just not very original in 2020.  It’s completely awesome that Marissa was striving to empower fellow mothers to find beauty in the imperfections of their bodies with these close-up photos of her stretch marks, but the reality is that we’ve seen these types of pictures so many times over that it just isn’t that impressive any more. Look, it’s totally courageous that she decided to share these pictures, but we just can’t be expected to applaud this like it’s the first post-pregnancy stomach we’ve seen. The stretch mark schtick has been going viral for over a decade, and at this point, it’s just not enough to make us stand up and cheer. Also, it was definitely a stretch that Marissa accompanied the stretch mark photos with the caption, “Nobody tells you this is what you’re going to look like after you have a baby,” because we’ve actually heard from hundreds of mothers that it’s going to look like that. While it’s amazing that she decided to share photos and talk about how she loves these imperfections because they remind her of the miracle of motherhood, we’re just not going to be interested until we see something new. Sorry, Marissa. This is pretty much just another drop in the bucket of mothers talking about their post-pregnancy bodies, and we just couldn’t muster the enthusiasm for something this redundant. Your stretch marks are absolutely beautiful, but until you find a way to get that point across that we haven’t already seen a million times, we’re not going to get too excited. Better luck next time."
A State Of Flow: Jimmy Buffett Has Been Up For 5 Straight Days Composing A Symphony About A Sangria Señorita,N/A,https://clickhole.com/a-state-of-flow-jimmy-buffett-has-been-up-for-5-straig-1840269445/,"The world had better get ready for a groundbreaking new musical work from Jimmy Buffett, because sources say that the musician is currently laser-focused on what could be his most complex creation yet: Jimmy Buffett has been up for five straight days composing a symphony about a sangria señorita. Wow. Jimmy Buffett has clearly entered an incredible state of creative flow. Sources from Jimmy Buffett’s PR team have revealed that five days ago, the “Margaritaville” singer was having a happy hour glass of sangria in his Palm Beach home when he suddenly began to hum, “Sangria señorita, my red wine mamacita,” under his breath. Buffett then tore straight to the music studio at back of his house and immediately began work on a three-hour classical symphony expanding upon the lyrics he’d just hummed, which reportedly tells the story of “an unlucky sailor whose fate turns around after he gets marooned in a small fishing town where he sees the most beautiful woman in the world drinking a glass of sangria.” Buffett has been awake continually for the last five days working on his composition, and he shows no signs of letting up as he continues to scrawl new ideas for the score all over the walls with a marker and has been maniacally banging on his piano at all hours of the night. The floors are cluttered with pages and pages of sheet music and the Hawaiian shirt he’s been wearing all week is torn and yellowed, but no one has cleaned up the house or bothered to request that Jimmy take a shower so as not to interfere with his creative process. While sources confirm that the symphony remains a work in progress, Buffett has apparently called in over 70 world-class string, percussion, and woodwind players to rehearse his scores, which he conducts by holding up a half-eaten hot dog from three days ago. He’s even assembled a men’s choir to sing operatic refrains during the symphony’s fourth and final movement, which begins, “She’s a sangria señorita/My woman margarita/She’s a golden pita/She’s beautiful, bonita.” It’s clear that Jimmy Buffett has become a conduit for some higher creative power, and he is stopping at nothing to put his vision down on paper. Though he’s spent most of the week inside his home writing, according to Palm Beach residents, yesterday morning a wide-eyed Buffett was seen on his front lawn playing a flute and shouting, “This is what I was put on Earth to do!” before ripping up the sheet music he was holding and sprinting back inside his home. Incredible. It seems as though the muses have sent Jimmy Buffett a message about a sangria señorita, and he has clearly taken advantage of the opportunity. Let’s hope he’s able to wrap up work on the symphony sometime soon, because we can’t wait to hear the final product!"
"True Love: When This Woman’s Husband Of 67 Years Passed Away, She Immediately Exploded And Died",N/A,https://clickhole.com/true-love-when-this-woman-s-husband-of-67-years-passed-1840154637/,"Get ready for a beautiful story that proves just how powerful true love can be: When this woman’s husband of 67 years passed away, she immediately exploded and died. Wow. What incredible, everlasting love! Gary and Beatrice Halstead were high school sweethearts before they got married in 1952, and when Gary was diagnosed with terminal colon cancer earlier this year, it was incredibly difficult for Beatrice to imagine life without her husband. After Gary was brought into the hospital’s care full time, Beatrice was by his side every day, from morning till night. Last week, Gary sadly lost his battle with cancer in the middle of the afternoon. But in a beautiful testament to their deep connection, Beatrice could not go even one second without her beloved Gary before her head flew off her body and started spinning around on the floor while her neck spouted blood like an open fire hydrant. Truly beautiful. Anyone would be lucky to have a lifelong love as strong and profound as this one. The couple’s souls were joined so inseparably that even though Beatrice was completely healthy, the moment Gary’s life on Earth ended, her body started whizzing through the air like a rapidly deflating balloon as her guts rained down and soaked everything in sight. And even once other parts of Beatrice’s body had been scattered across the room, her severed hand was still clasped around Gary’s on the hospital bed in a truly touching symbol of the couple’s love. Okay, this is just too sweet! This is seriously like something straight out of a romance movie! As if this amazing love story couldn’t get any more heartwarming, the hospital staff managed to scoop up more than half of Beatrice’s organs off of the walls and seal them in a jar so that the couple could be buried together in the same grave. Wow. The magnificent love between Gary and Beatrice proves that soulmates really do exist. Our hearts are absolutely melting at this incredible love story. May Gary, Beatrice, and their eternal love rest in peace!"
Unshakable Determination In The Face Of Adversity: Mom Is Currently Telling The CVS Cashier A Fourth Phone Number To Try For A Discount Card,N/A,https://clickhole.com/unshakable-determination-in-the-face-of-adversity-mom-1840154685/,"Get ready to feel inspired, because the story currently unfolding at the Main Street Shopping Centre in Holbrook, NY proves just how resilient the human spirit can be: Mom is currently telling the CVS cashier a fourth phone number to try for a discount card. Wow! Mom’s determination will not be shaken! No adversity is too great for her! Mom purposely drove the extra three minutes past Rite Aid to CVS just so she could take advantage of their buy-one-get-one-50-percent-off deal on Crest toothpaste, but she needs a CVS ExtraCare account to get the discount, and she’s determined to stop at nothing until she remembers which phone number is attached to her account. Although the first phone number she gave the cashier failed, she kept her head held high and immediately started listing other phone numbers that might help her save the $1.25 on toothpaste that she came for. Way to go, Mom! While others would have given up after listing their home number, cell number, and their husband’s cell number, in an act of absolute bravery, Mom’s now giving the cashier the home phone number for the townhouse we haven’t lived in since 2001. Though the line only continues to grow behind her, Mom’s persistence is utterly undeterred! But just because the fourth number also failed doesn’t mean Mom’s going to give up. In fact, she just asked the cashier if she could type in her home address instead of her phone number, and as the cashier started to shake his head, Mom masterfully added, “You know what, let me try my sister’s phone number,” proving that she came here to get the deal, and she’s not leaving without her discounted toothpaste. Most people would just chalk this up as a loss right now and accept that the nine coupons they’re going to get on their receipt will pretty much balance out what they’re failing to save on the toothpaste, but then again, most people aren’t Mom. Though the cashier has explained Mom could always come back when she has the physical ExtraCare card with her, Mom just accused her of incorrectly typing in the first phone numbers she gave her and asked if she could try those again. You’ve got this, Mom! Your resilience in the face of such daunting odds is nothing short of amazing, and we are absolutely here for it! One way or another, we know you’re going to get that deal!"
Call It A Day: You Could Just Do This Shit Tomorrow,N/A,https://clickhole.com/call-it-a-day-you-could-just-do-this-shit-tomorrow-1840030884/,"Good Lord. You’ve been at this shit all day, but there’s still so much left on your plate. Look, you just don’t have the gas in the tank to get it all done, so how about you just call it a day? You could definitely just do this shit tomorrow. Seriously, just fuck it. If you were actually going to get all of this stuff done, you’d already have done it. Just pack it all up. There’s barely any time left in the the workday anyway. Tomorrow you’re going to have so much more opportunity to get this stuff finished. What’s the worst that’s gonna happen if you just leave? Someone sees an Excel spreadsheet slightly later? That can’t possibly make a difference in the grand scheme of things. In fact, there’s a solid chance no one will even notice an issue. It just doesn’t matter. Why don’t you just mess around on Facebook for the rest of the day then head out of here? Besides, it’s not like you’re never going do the work you need to do. You’re going to get it all done—just tomorrow instead of today. Isn’t that pretty much the same thing? It’s fine. And definitely don’t worry about doing laundry or any chores once you’re home. Tomorrow you can re-wear what you wore yesterday. Sure, that shirt smells a little stale, but it’s nothing too bad—do you really think someone’s going to call you out on it? Not likely. Seriously, it’s not going to be a big deal if all you do tonight is sit on the couch and drink a beer. You can leave the dishes in the sink for one more night, too. Tomorrow, you can get it all done no problem.  Think about it: There’s just no reason to do anything today when you have tomorrow right there. The best part of this whole situation is that you’re definitely going to feel super rested tomorrow because you’re not doing anything else for the rest of today. You’re going to wake up really easily and just feel excited to get everything done. This break will probably turn out to be just what you needed to have the most productive day of your life tomorrow! Pretty awesome. Okay, great. Feels good to get that all settled. You’ll do this shit tomorrow, then."
Gaining Ground: Cory Booker Is Having A Record-Breaking Fundraising Month After Offering Donors The Chance To Kick Him In The Groin,N/A,https://clickhole.com/gaining-ground-cory-booker-is-having-a-record-breaking-1840031319/,"Although 2020 presidential candidate Cory Booker has been polling behind several other Democratic candidates the last few months, he’s just experienced a surge in donations that may very well make him a serious contender for the nomination: Cory Booker is having a record-breaking fundraising month after offering donors the chance to kick him in the groin. Whoa. Could this be what carries Cory Booker to the Oval Office? The New Jersey senator first announced the new offer on his website earlier this month, stating, “In order to stay in this race, I need your help. For the rest of the month, if you donate to my campaign, you’ll get to kick me in the groin. Act now to become a part of my grassroots campaign!” The offer included several different price options for donations, with $5 as the base donation necessary to kick him in the groin, $20 getting you the chance to take a few steps into the kick, $100 letting you watch him squirm around on the ground afterward, and $500 or more also earning you a free T-shirt that reads, “I kicked Cory Booker in the nuts!” While this was certainly a bold move from the Booker campaign, it’s clearly paying off, as he’s already raked in a record amount of $11 million in donations this month thanks to the thousands of Americans who jumped at the chance to kick him in the groin. Following a recent campaign event in Des Moines, IA, Booker stood before a line of several hundred people who’d donated to his campaign and were ready to redeem their opportunity to strike him in the crotch as hard as possible with their foot or knee. After each kick, Booker would wince and hop around for a bit before pulling himself upright to shake the kicker’s hand and thank them for believing in his vision of a unified country. “I was initially a Warren supporter, but after hearing Cory Booker’s plan for America, I thought to myself, ‘I just have to kick this guy in the nuts,’” said one of his new supporters who attended the Iowa event. “And after watching him grab his crotch and keel over in pain from my kick, I am more confident than ever that I made the right decision.” Following the announcement of this new campaign strategy, several prominent politicians have even switched their support to Cory Booker, including Rep. Ilhan Omar and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Both representatives rescinded their endorsements of Bernie Sanders so they could instead get the chance kick Booker in the nuts, and have encouraged their supporters to do the same. Wow. Thanks to this major increase in donations fueled by people who wanted to give the senator a good kick to the groin, it seems like the Booker campaign still stands a chance at the 2020 Democratic nomination. Time is ticking as we approach the primary, and for candidates who hope to lead the race, every little gain counts. Time will tell if this strategy gave Booker the boost he needed to get to the White House."
Got Your Back: Spotify Has Announced That They’ll Go Ahead And Put You In Private Mode As Soon As You Start Listening To Ed Sheeran,N/A,https://clickhole.com/got-your-back-spotify-has-announced-that-they-ll-go-ah-1839925611/,"For the last few years, Spotify has dominated the music streaming industry, and with a new feature that has users everywhere cheering, it’s no surprise why: Spotify has announced that they’ll go ahead and put you in private mode as soon as you start listening to Ed Sheeran. Hell yes. This is going to save people from so much embarrassment. While everyone likes to listen to red-haired British pop sensation Ed Sheeran from time to time, nobody wants anyone else to know about it, and thankfully, Spotify has stepped up to solve that problem. Now, the streaming service has a dedicated feature to protect you from seeming like the kind of person who listens to music that, despite having been made by a 28-year-old married man, seems to be intended exclusively for preteens. “We’re thrilled to say that from here on out, the second you press play on an Ed Sheeran track, we’ll put your account into a private session so you don’t suffer the total humiliation of having your followers watch while you work your way through his 2017 album that’s mortifyingly titled ‘÷’,” said the company in a press release. “We understand that everyone likes to hear ‘Shape Of You’ every now and again, and we believe that you shouldn’t have to suffer through the fear and worry that comes with knowing a friend or coworker might find out. Now, you don’t have to.”  Just awesome. It can be difficult to remember to turn on private mode before listening to Ed Sheeran, so it’s so great to know that you can count on Spotify to hide the fact that you’re listening to “Thinking Out Loud” on repeat. This feature even has an exciting perk for Spotify Premium members: It’ll disguise your listening history to make it seem like you’ve been rocking out to one of Pitchfork’s Best New Tracks instead of whatever Ed Sheeran single from 2012 you’re actually blasting into your headphones. And there’s no reason to worry about accidentally turning off the automatic private session while you’re listening to Ed Sheeran, either—Spotify confirms that if you do select public listening mode while an Ed Sheeran track is playing, they’ll immediately send out a message to your followers letting them know that your account has been hacked. That way, your friends will assume that you had no hand in putting on Ed Sheeran’s 2017 duet with Beyoncé, and you’ll be in the clear. Wow. Hats off to Spotify for coming through with this absolutely amazing new feature that’s definitely going to help you save face the next time you listen to “I Don’t Care.” Take note, Tidal, because this is how you do customer service!

"Heroic Kindness: When This Man Found A Pube On A Toilet Seat, He Would Not Rest Until He Returned It To Its Rightful Owner",N/A,https://clickhole.com/heroic-kindness-when-this-man-found-a-pube-on-a-toilet-1839925371/,"Get ready for a heartwarming story that will completely restore your faith in humanity: When this man found a pube on a toilet seat, he would not rest until he returned it to its rightful owner. Just incredible. With so much bitterness and cruelty in the world, it’s amazing to see that some people will still take a stand to make the world a better place. Last week, Omaha resident Tim Clemens was about to use the men’s bathroom in a coffee shop when he noticed a stray pubic hair on the toilet seat. Without missing a beat, the good Samaritan quickly leapt into action and started showing the curly, black pubic hair to every single customer and employee in the coffee shop to see if it belonged to them. When no one in the coffee shop claimed the pube, Tim raced out of the establishment with the 1.5 inch-long pubic hair in hand, more determined than ever to find its rightful owner. If only everyone were as generous and big-hearted as Tim! Tim’s quest to return the pubic hair to its rightful owner took months. He hung up posters with the pube’s picture on them all over the city. He took out ad space in his local paper asking if anyone had any information about an individual who was missing a pubic hair. Nobody came forward, and Tim began to lose hope. He says that he thought he was going to have to glue the lost pubic hair to his own bush to give it a good home, but he knew he’d be a poor substitute for the pube’s true owner. Fortunately, four months into his search, Tim had a major breakthrough. He managed to find the pube’s owner by examining the cafe’s security footage and discovering a man, whose hair color perfectly matched that of the pube, who visited the coffee shop every morning and used the bathroom. Tim then spent the night in the bathroom to wait for the man’s morning arrival, and when the man entered the following morning, Tim was ecstatic. Tim confirms that he was able to successfully re-attach the hair to the man’s pelvis, and that his bush looked absolutely perfect with the pubic hair was back in place. We are standing and applauding right now! Tim is truly a hero! Despite going above and beyond to return the pubic hair, Tim remains humble about his amazing deed. “Pubes are the hairs that let people know you’re sexually mature. There’s no telling what disaster could come from missing one, so as soon as I saw it, I knew I had to do whatever it took to get it back to its owner,” said Tim. “I can’t even imagine how terrible I would feel if I lost one of my pubes. But if that tragedy were ever to befall me, I just hope that someone will be willing to do the same to return it.” What an absolutely beautiful gesture! It’s so great to see that kindness still exists in the world. If everyone were a little more like Tim Clemens, the world would be a better place."
"Shocking Effects Of Climate Change: The Elderly, Smiling Man Who Slowly Walks Around Your Neighborhood With His Arms Behind His Back All Year Round Is Wearing A Slightly Lighter Knit Sweater This Year",N/A,https://clickhole.com/shocking-effects-of-climate-change-the-elderly-smilin-1839925453/,"There’s no shortage of evidence proving the imminent threats of climate change, and the following story is yet another sobering example of how global warming is affecting our world: The elderly, smiling man who slowly walks around your neighborhood with his arms behind his back all year round is wearing a slightly lighter knit sweater this year. Just tragic. This is a deeply concerning development for anyone worried about the future of our planet. A new report from NASA’s Goddard Institute of Space Studies confirms that rising global temperatures have caused the elderly man you always see walking around your neighborhood every single day to replace the thick navy blue cable-knit sweater he usually wears with a slightly lighter knit sweater. The report further found that global emissions of carbon dioxide will need to drop drastically over the next decade if the man is going to be able to continue wearing his large, billowing khaki pants as he slowly makes his way through your neighborhood with his hands clasped behind his back for some reason. Climate change deniers need to look no further than the new feather-light sweater the ancient man’s wearing while he quietly hums to himself on his loops around the block to realize what environmental peril our world is in. “The fact that the elderly man, who always seems to be on a walk no matter what time of day it is, was forced to order a lighter sweater from the L.L. Bean catalog is a massive red flag about the state of our planet’s climate,” said Nell Yates, the report’s lead researcher. “If dramatic actions aren’t taken immediately, then by the year 2030, the man is going to be wearing a tank top and shorts while he smiles politely at you but never takes his arms out from behind his back to wave hello. The time for radical climate action is now, or by 2050, the old man will not be wearing a shirt at all, just a pair of biking shorts covered in reflective tape.” This absolutely chilling. The evidence of our Earth’s dying climate has never been clearer. If we want to see a world in which our children can look out the window at any hour of the day to see the very old man pass by their house wearing a thick wool sweater, then we need strong climate change policy now."
Hell Yes! Sephora Is Offering A Promotion Where If You Spend Less Than $20 You Can Keep Your Dignity,N/A,https://clickhole.com/hell-yes-sephora-is-offering-a-promotion-where-if-you-1839779828/,"If you’re a makeup or skincare fanatic, you’re going to want to head over to Sephora ASAP, because they just launched a seriously cool deal that you won’t want to miss out on. Starting today, Sephora is offering a promotion where if you spend less than $20 you can keep your dignity!  Hell yes!  Shoppers at participating Sephora locations around the world will be able to take advantage of this awesome promotion for the next two weeks, and the process is incredibly simple: As long as you leave the store with fewer than $20 worth of overpriced beauty products with names like “Ultra Dewy Glow Creme” and “Bye-Bye Cellulite Bum Scrub,” you’ll get to go home with your dignity in hand. Once you’ve received a receipt confirming that you didn’t shell out more than the $20 maximum, you’ll be free to go to bed that night feeling like the kind of self-respecting person who doesn’t spend a quarter of your paycheck buying skincare products that come in what appears to be $15 worth of packaging and will ultimately make you look more or less the same as you did before. Just incredible. This is the perfect chance to shop at Sephora without feeling the humiliation that comes with handing over your credit card to pay for $100 worth of face masks, which you’ve somehow managed to convince yourself aren’t just sheets of paper covered in random goop. “We are so excited to offer this new promotion, which gives our shoppers the exclusive opportunity to leave our store with their heads held high, secure in the knowledge that they didn’t let their personal insecurities and craven desire to accumulate material objects make them purchase an $80 anti-aging serum despite still being in their 20s, or a $50 lipstick that they know deep down looks just like the one they already own,” said the beauty company in a press release. “We think this will give our customers an awesome chance to check out some of our products without sacrificing their hard-earned self esteem.” Wow. So cool! This is unbelievable news for those who love shopping at Sephora, but want to leave the store with their pride intact. With deals this awesome, it’s no wonder that Sephora is at the forefront of the beauty game today! "
How The Fuck Are We Supposed To Know What This Means? The Bathrooms At This Trendy Bar Are Designated By Images Of A Whale And A Bottle Of Glue,N/A,https://clickhole.com/how-the-fuck-are-we-supposed-to-know-what-this-means-t-1839257802/,"If you have to pee, we hope you’re okay with holding it for a bit, because it’s going to be a while before we figure out this restroom situation: The bathrooms at this trendy bar in Philadelphia, PA are designated by images of a whale and a bottle of glue. What the hell? How the fuck are we supposed to know what this means? So, for whatever goddamn reason, The Langley, a super trendy bar in Center City, has decided to designate their two bathrooms with just a sign in the shape of a whale and another in the shape of a bottle of glue, making it is absolutely impossible to figure out who is supposed to use which one. It seems like they were probably going for a men’s room and a women’s room sort of thing, but how the hell would we know if a whale is supposed to refer to a man or a woman? Neither of these images are associated with gender in any recognizable way. Maybe the whale is the men’s room because Moby Dick is male? And the glue is the women’s, because women…hold stuff together?  No. There’s no way that’s right. Goddamnit. We just want to go to the bathroom, not solve some fucking puzzle. There’s no difference between the two doors besides the whale and the glue, so we’ve got very little to go on here. Maybe that means that both of the rooms are gender neutral? It’d be really helpful if they just spelled that out for us, though, because using an animal for one and an office supply for the other makes it far from clear. All we know is that these two doors are the only doors in the back corner of the restaurant under a sign that says “restrooms,” so it looks like we just have to keep waiting to see who walks out of them. The best move is probably to stand between the two so it doesn’t look like we’ve really chosen a side. Christ, it’d be so helpful if there were someone else in line for the bathroom right now. The best we’ve got is that some guy walked over, took in the whole situation, shook his head and walked away. Could it be that one bathroom is whale themed and the other is glue themed? We know that makes no fucking sense, but neither does designating them like this in the first place. God, this is so fucking annoying. Is it that hard to just label the facilities clearly? Here’s hoping we get some answers on this situation ASAP, because we seriously need to use the bathroom."
Did We Need To Know This?: The U.S. Forest Service Just Revealed That Smokey Bear Is Attracted To Both Female Bears And Human Women,N/A,https://clickhole.com/did-we-need-to-know-this-the-u-s-forest-service-just-1839537306/,"Smokey Bear has been the face of the U.S. Forest Service’s forest fire prevention campaign for 75 years, but the agency has just revealed a glimpse into Smokey’s backstory that doesn’t really seem like pertinent information. Earlier today, the U.S. Forest Service revealed that Smokey Bear is attracted to both female bears and human women. Hmm. Doesn’t seem like we really needed to know this. The new information about Smokey Bear’s sexuality was announced in a statement released on the U.S. Forest Service’s official website this morning, accompanied by an illustration of Smokey with one arm around a female bear and the other arm around a woman. “Smokey Bear is attracted to both female bears and human women!” the statement read. “Although all of Smokey’s previous long-term relationships have been with female bears, he has had plenty of sexual experiences with human women, but it’s just never developed into something more serious. While the biological similarities Smokey shares with female bears offer him many comforts that remind him of his childhood, Smokey finds the differences that exist between him and human women quite erotic as well. He is currently single, but he’s actively looking for the right female bear or human woman for him! He is also interested in one day having a threesome featuring both a human woman and a female bear.” Well, huh. If they really wanted to flesh out Smokey Bear’s backstory, it would have been much more useful to tell us something that has to do with forests or something. Can’t say this really adds anything. Despite the fact that this is definitely not something children would ever need to know about in order to prevent forest fires, the website has also released a chart geared toward kids that explains what specifically attracts Smokey to human women and female bears. A column titled “What Smokey Likes About Human Women,” lists things like “soft, hairless skin,” “have breasts,” and “can drive a car to take us to the movies.” The other column, titled “What Smokey Likes About Female Bears,” highlights that they’re “excellent foragers,” “covered in beautiful fur,” and “don’t waste your time playing games.” As though the Forest Service didn’t get this pretty meaningless point across already, the site has also released a new commercial where Smokey debuts an extended version of his famous catchphrase, “Only you can prevent forest fires.” In the ad, after a family successfully puts out a fire at their campsite, Smokey walks out from the bushes and says they did a great job before turning to the camera and exclaiming, “Only you can prevent forest fires. But any female bear or human woman can make love to me on the ground.” Wow. This is definitely seems like the kind of thing that we didn’t ever need to hear about, but the U.S. Forest Service clearly thought it was worth our while for some reason. Here’s hoping that the next time the agency adds info to Smokey Bear’s backstory, it’s somehow related to helping people prevent forest fires and not just factoids about who Smokey likes to have sex with."
"The Power Of Teamwork: When A Whale Washed Up On Shore, This Community Banded Together To Disobey God’s Plan",N/A,https://clickhole.com/the-power-of-teamwork-when-a-whale-washed-up-on-shore-1839333000/,"Here’s a story about an incredible group of people who proved that when you work together, anything is possible: When a whale washed up on shore, this community banded together to disobey God’s plan. Wow. This just goes to show that a group of people can unite to spit in the face of the Lord as long as they put aside their differences! Yesterday morning, a 42-foot-long sperm whale washed onto the shores of Rehoboth Beach in Delaware, and though it had been alive when it appeared on the sand, it was writhing in pain and clearly not far from the death God had chosen for it. Even though the whale would not have been sent to die slowly in the scorching sun if the Lord had not intended for it to perish, a group of concerned beachgoers quickly sprung into action and began working together to pervert God’s grand designs by returning the whale to the sea. Teamwork FTW!! It just goes to show that when heretics work together, they can make themselves hateful in the eyes of the Lord by usurping His role as the sole arbiter of who shall live and who shall die! Though the whale cried out and moaned in what should have been a private conversation with the Lord during its last minutes on Earth, these brave people cooperated to seamlessly lift and push the whale together so as to interfere with the Lord’s Divine Will. Despite heavy winds and rising tides—clear omens from the Lord that these heathens should stop in their tracks—they remained focused as they rebelled against the wishes of God. And when they finally returned the whale to the sea, they started hugging and jumping up and down in celebration of their utter defiance of the Lord! A representative from the Delaware Department of Natural Resources confirmed that if the whale had spent even two more minutes above water, it wouldn’t have survived, making it all the more impressive that these people managed to disrupt the Lord’s intentions just in the nick of time! Just awesome. Though these beachgoers will not go unpunished, and our vengeful, jealous God will visit upon them divine retribution, for now they’re celebrating their incredible accomplishment. Let this be a lesson to people everywhere: With some cooperation and commitment, you, too, can disobey the Lord!"
Major Step Backwards For Science: A Group Of Leading Biologists At Stanford Has Lost Their Big Notebook Full Of Elephant Facts,N/A,https://clickhole.com/major-step-backwards-for-science-a-group-of-leading-bi-1839334378/,"Lovers of the natural world are going to be majorly disappointed today, because there’s been some seriously bad news from the forefront of zoological science: A group of leading biologists at Stanford has lost their big notebook full of elephant facts. Absolutely heartbreaking. This is such a huge loss for the scientific community. A group of veteran researchers in the biology department at Stanford made the sad announcement today that they misplaced the big notebook in which they had written all the facts they learned about elephants, which means that the scientific community no longer knows anything at all about elephants. “Unfortunately, this was the notebook where we had written down all the different species of elephant, the average height and weight of an elephant, what elephants eat, all of it,” explained Susan Choi, a lead researcher on the team. “Over the course of many years, dozens of scientists wrote hundreds of facts about elephants in that notebook’s pages, and now all that priceless information is lost to the world. It’s a tragedy.” How devastating! It could take scientists decades to recoup all the important discoveries and insights that went missing with this notebook. The researchers have put up flyers all around the area with a photo of the notebook, which was a purple, Mead brand spiral-bound book with college-ruled paper. They also specified that the notebook has a piece of duct tape on the front with “STANFORD ELEPHANT FACTS” written on it in Sharpie. “We think we left the notebook on the train, so it could be anywhere at this point,” said Choi. “We just hope that for the good of the planet and of scientific advancement, if anyone comes across it they will give it back to us. If we don’t find it, it will take years to relearn all the basic information about elephants we lost. And we’d have to make up a new Latin name for elephants, because we can’t remember what the original one was.” This is so unfortunate. How will anybody be able to learn about elephants now? Stanford has already sent several members of the research team to Tanzania to begin collecting new information about elephants—and this time, they plan to copy the facts they learn into two different notebooks to reduce the possibility of another incident like this one. But if you live in Northern California, keep your eye out for that notebook, because it contains essential scientific information about one of the most majestic animals on the planet!"
Not Fooling Anyone: This Middle Schooler Who’s Loudly Claiming He Already Lost His Virginity Obviously Doesn’t Realize Everyone Can See His Chastity Belt,N/A,https://clickhole.com/not-fooling-anyone-this-middle-schooler-who-s-loudly-c-1838634254/,"Get ready for the most cringeworthy story you’ve ever heard, because this boy in Sparks, NE just got caught in a massive, humiliating lie and he doesn’t even know it: This middle schooler who’s loudly claiming he already lost his virginity obviously doesn’t realize everyone can see his chastity belt. C’mon, kid. Your lie isn’t fooling anyone.  Although Brandon Morreti, a seventh-grader at Mendive Middle School, is currently attempting to convince the other kids at his lunch table that he lost his virginity at summer camp last year, it’s extremely clear he’s making the whole thing up because his iron chastity belt is still fastened over his pants, and it’s not like he could just pry the 400-year-old family heirloom off himself and have sex without the brass key required to for the massive padlock that keeps it fastened around his genitals. Since everyone knows that Brandon’s dad is the only one with the key and that he wears it on a chain around his neck for safekeeping, it’s completely obvious that all of Brandon’s elaborate details about how he did it with one of the girls at his camp are complete bullshit. Seriously, give it a rest, dude! You don’t honestly think your friends are going to believe you lost your virginity when there’s 5-inch-thick metal barrier covering your crotch, do you? You’re just coming off as pathetic. Besides, we know Brandon’s father would literally never unlock the belt because he’s always talking about how “the desires of the flesh” would “sully Brandon’s purity irrevocably and consign him to a life of pain and suffering.” God, it’s so pathetic to listen to Brandon claim that the girl from camp is now his girlfriend and they “totally do it all the time” when we all know he’s going to be wearing that belt until the day of his wedding, when Brandon’s dad will finally unlock the belt so that he can consummate his nuptials and sire a child under the consecrating gaze of the Lord. Face it, Brandon, everyone will know you’re a virgin until your father unshackles the belt for good and melts it down in a furnace where it’ll be reshaped for your firstborn son. You’re completely delusional if you think you’re fooling anyone. It’s seriously just embarrassing at this point."
The Lawsuit Of The Century: Jimmy Carter Is Suing The Makers of Truck Nutz For Using His Likeness After Discovering Their Products Resemble His Testicles Exactly,N/A,https://clickhole.com/the-lawsuit-of-the-century-jimmy-carter-is-suing-the-m-1835840271/,"A major legal battle is underway between a beloved American icon and the company he believes wronged him: Jimmy Carter is suing the makers of Truck Nutz for using his likeness without authorization after discovering their products resemble his testicles exactly. Wow, this is sure to be a lawsuit that will take years to resolve. President Carter filed a lawsuit Monday against Truck Nutz, the company that manufactures plastic and chrome genitalia that consumers can hang on their vehicles, for allegedly appropriating the image of his swinging, teardrop shaped scrotum without his permission and using it for their products, Truck Nutz and Biker Ballz. Carter’s lawsuit accuses Truck Nutz of false endorsement and deceptive trade practices, and Carter’s lawyers have reported that when the former president looks at any Truck Nutz product, he “feels like he’s looking at his hairless ballsack in the mirror.” There’s no two ways about it: This is shaping up to be one of the most contentious court cases of the century. “If Truck Nutz had simply called me up in advance and asked for my permission to use my testicles as the model for their product, I would have eagerly allowed them to copy my balls for free,” President Carter said in an impassioned statement to the press outside Webster County Superior Court shortly after filing his lawsuit. “Instead, this malicious company used the image of my testicles without asking, and they made them way too big. They took my nice, modest testicles and made them humongous. They look like giant clones of my tiny testes! I’m not just mad that they took my likeness, I’m also furious that they made my balls too big!” Mr. Carter, who has since been preparing for the Oct. 5 court date by combing through his records for pictures of his balls circa 1999 so that he can enter them into evidence in the courtroom, will be representing himself. What a mess! It’s now up to a judge to decide whether the likeness of Jimmy Carter’s testicles are indeed hanging from thousands of trucks across the nation. Truck Nutz better lawyer up, because it sounds like President Carter is out for blood!"
Feminism FTW! Mattel Just Added Diotima Of Mantinea To Their ‘Who The Fuck Were They—Women In History’ Doll Collection,N/A,https://clickhole.com/feminism-ftw-mattel-just-added-diotima-of-mantinea-to-1838950909/,"One of the biggest toy companies in the U.S. just did something awesome that’s going to have feminists everywhere standing up and cheering: Mattel just added Diotima of Mantinea to their “Who The Fuck Were They—Women In History” doll collection. How awesome! Whoever the hell Diotima of Mantinea was, she is no doubt going to inspire thousands of girls! Mattel announced today that they will be adding Diotima of Mantinea, who was apparently an ancient Greek philosopher, to their “Who The Fuck Were They?” line of dolls, which represent amazing women from throughout history who pretty much seem like total randos if you aren’t, like, an expert on whatever historical period they come from.  The Diotima doll, which will be a 12-inch-tall likeness of the prophetess and philosopher who was said to be a contemporary of Plato, will come equipped with a realistic roll of parchment, a tiny ancient Greek-style amphora, and a pamphlet explaining to kids that though they might think Diotima is just some random-ass lady, she was in fact a preeminent thinker whose teachings helped shape modern day concepts like Platonic love.  “We have spent over a year designing this exciting new Diotima of Mantinea doll, and we hope girls around the country will proudly show it to their friends and feel empowered to answer questions like ‘Diotima of what?’ and ‘What the hell are you saying? Is that a real name?’” said Michelle Golden, a spokesperson for Mattel. “At Mattel, we believe that it’s vital to expose the next generation of kids to women who made their mark on the world to some degree, though not so much so that your average person would look at the doll and go, ‘Oh, I know who that is.’” Hell yeah! This sounds like the kind awesome, feminist toy any kid would be lucky to have! The new doll will join 20th century Polish composer Grażyna Bacewicz, Colombian revolutionary Policarpa Salavarrieta, and early Chinese empress Wu Zetian as the fourth addition to the “Who The Fuck Were They?” line. And with the new Diotima doll, Mattel has also introduced a special “Who The Fuck Were They?” display case with engraved descriptions of each figurine, so that girls can easily keep straight what each woman’s deal was and how she ended up becoming sort of interesting as far as people from throughout history go. Well, this is just awesome! The world needs more empowering toys for girls, and this Diotima of Mantinea doll seems like it will be a great step in the right direction. Bravo, Mattel!"
Awesome: West Elm Has Released An Extremely Uncomfortable Pull-Out Couch So Friends Who Come Over Don’t Get Any Ideas About Staying The Night,N/A,https://clickhole.com/awesome-west-elm-has-released-an-extremely-uncomfortab-1838979293/,"If you already have a couch, get ready to put it out on the street, because there’s a new sofa on the market that you’ll definitely want to buy: West Elm has released an extremely uncomfortable pull-out couch so friends who come over don’t get any ideas about staying the night.  Hell yes! We totally want to own this thing! Available this week, West Elm’s new couch pulls out into such a physically inhospitable bed that no friend of yours—no matter how long they claim it’ll take them to get back to their apartment—will wind up spending the night at your place. The couch, which is called the Impossible Sleeper, is made of an incredibly thin mattress pad placed over a bed frame with three times more coils than the average pull-out, ensuring that even the drunkest and most exhausted guests will muster the strength to call a cab home before braving its lumpy, barbed surface. Right on! Now you can hang with your friends as late as you want without fearing that you’re going to have to let them crash in your living room. “As soon as your friend lies on top of the Impossible Sleeper, its pre-rusted coils will emit a screech so loud it’ll have even the heaviest sleepers checking train schedules,” said West Elm in a press release. “It should only take about 30 seconds of contact with this couch for your friend to realize that the pain it’ll inflict on their bodies won’t be worth whatever extra sleep they were hoping to get, and they’ll soon be on their way home so you can have your house to yourself again.” Wow! Just awesome. This couch sounds like it could be a total game-changer for hosts who just want some privacy at the end of the night. We can’t wait to try it out!"
Yikes: A New Study Shows That Open-Plan Offices Decrease Productivity For All Employees Except For The Most Annoying Guy There,N/A,https://clickhole.com/yikes-a-new-study-shows-that-open-plan-offices-decreas-1838979625/,"Although many companies have switched to open-plan offices in recent years in the hopes of increasing workflow and communication, new data show that these open offices aren’t nearly as beneficial as experts once believed: A study by Harvard researchers just concluded that open-plan offices lead to decreased productivity for all employees except the most annoying guy there. Wow. This is a major finding that will definitely have some companies rethinking their office designs. According to the study, open-plan offices where employees have little to no privacy lead to a 40% decrease in daily productivity for everyone working there, excepting one super annoying guy who is completely undeterred by the lack of spatial boundaries and thrives in an environment where he can shout questions and comments across the room indiscriminately as if no one is trying to get anything done. The researchers discovered that, unlike other employees, this man doesn’t seem to require private space since he’s totally comfortable staying at his desk to make and receive calls, discuss sensitive matters with his boss, and eat fragrant lunches that come wrapped in seemingly endless layers of loud, crinkly packaging.  Yikes. It might be time for to come up with some new ideas for offices that will benefit more than just one incredibly obnoxious person! Despite the illusion of collaboration that open offices create, the research further shows that open-plan workplaces lead to fewer face-to-face conversations with anyone who isn’t the super annoying guy, who is apt to walk around the office chatting with whoever he wants and showing absolutely no respect for anyone else’s time. While these floor plans tend to promote online-only communication and increase isolation for most employees, the annoying guy loves having everybody around so that when he sees a funny YouTube video, he can dramatically crack up and make everyone come over to his desk to watch it, even if it’s just some blurry video of a dog where nothing really happens. Interactions like these leave him feeling refreshed and ready to get back to work, while everyone else finds their day totally derailed by the stupid ordeal. Although the annoying man is able to remain completely focused on his tasks in the open-office space, the study found that the sounds of him clumsily switching between sitting at his desk on an exercise ball and raising his desk to standing height at least once each hour have a deleterious effect on every single other employee’s work. The researchers added that this man seems to experience an uptick in work satisfaction when he is able to nod his head vigorously along to the loud techno music everyone can hear blasting from his giant over-the-ear headphones, while this behavior causes a steep decline in feelings of happiness and camaraderie for all those around him. Wow. This is such an eye-opening look at workplace culture and the many ways it can affect productivity and employee satisfaction for both regular workers and the one really annoying guy. Here’s hoping companies take this study to heart and give their open-plan office designs a second thought."
Fascinating: The BBC Just Revealed That They Record David Attenborough’s ‘Planet Earth’ Narration In Advance And Then The Events He Describes Somehow Happen Months Later,N/A,https://clickhole.com/fascinating-the-bbc-just-revealed-that-they-record-dav-1838912669/,"Get excited, because the people behind one of the greatest documentary series of all time just offered an incredible glimpse behind the scenes of their amazing work: The BBC has revealed that they record David Attenborough’s Planet Earth narration in advance and then the events he describes somehow happen months later.  Fascinating! This offers so much insight into how this beloved nature series captures its stunning footage of rare and exotic animals.  The BBC revealed this exciting look into their process yesterday during a Reddit AMA with Planet Earth’s production team, when a Reddit user asked how the show’s creators managed to pull off such impressive cinematography in the natural world. The BBC representatives replied, “About six months prior to shooting, David Attenborough sits down alone in a windowless room and just starts talking about different animals—just talking and talking about extremely detailed interactions between iguanas and lions and puffins and stuff. We record him (not sure if he’s aware of this) and then we bring our camera to the locations he mentioned in his narration, and sure enough, everything he said would happen somehow just up and happens.” How cool! Aspiring documentarians definitely should be taking notes on this!  The Planet Earth crew also revealed that the way that they know that it’s time to start producing a new season of the show is that David Attenborough will stop what he’s doing and mutter, “Here come the animals,” and then make a beeline for the recording room where he starts describing different creatures engaging in a variety of activities, all of which come to pass a few months later exactly as he describes. They also added that Attenborough recently mumbled the words, “And now the iguana transforms into a pig for no reason, in a process called ‘migration,’” which means that the BBC has reason to believe that, since Attenborough’s narration has never been wrong, the next season of Planet Earth will feature footage of an iguana abruptly and inexplicably morphing into a pig.  This is just the best! We’re all so lucky that the BBC gave us a look at their process for producing Planet Earth. Hopefully David Attenborough finishes narrating the new season soon so that the events he described can start happening and get captured on film for all of us to see!"
"Latest Attack: The Islamic State Has Reluctantly Claimed Credit For A Crying Man Who Threw A Flip-Flop At The Presidential Motorcade, Missed, Then Shit His Pants",N/A,https://clickhole.com/latest-attack-the-islamic-state-has-reluctantly-claime-1836316806/,"It is a sad and terrifying fact that the Islamic State remains a deadly threat to countries all over the world, and it looks like the vicious terrorist organization has struck yet again on American soil: ISIS has reluctantly claimed credit for a crying man who threw a flip-flop at the presidential motorcade, missed, and then shit his pants. There’s simply no two ways about it: ISIS is still doing everything in its power to continue its reign of terror on the western world.  Early yesterday morning in Washington D.C., a sobbing man ran into the street as President Donald Trump’s motorcade was driving past, threw one Superman-themed flip-flop that almost grazed the roof of the presidential limo, and then proceeded to take a loud, wet shit in his pants before waddling away while still in tears. In a statement released today, ISIS has come forward to begrudgingly take credit for this deeply pathetic excuse for a terrorist attack. The Islamic State initially thought about distancing themselves from the man who threw a flip-flop at the president then immediately started sweating profusely as diarrhea exploded out of his ass for several minutes non-stop, but then figured it’s their duty to be honest that the attack was on their behalf, regardless of how humiliating it was.  “We are ashamed to announce that the martyr who soiled his pants and quietly whimpered to himself after attempting to throw a flip-flop at the president’s car performed this humiliating action on behalf of the Islamic State and for the glory of the Caliphate,” said a noticeably squeamish, masked spokesman in a video ISIS released online this morning. “We are not proud of this man and his bad attack, and we are also very embarrassed that he sobbed the words ‘owl aptard’ instead of ‘Allahu akbar’ as he hurled his flip-flop at the president’s car, but we would be lying if we said he wasn’t a foot soldier in our righteous Jihad against the West. Our next attack will be much better, so everyone should remain fearful of the impending deaths you shall all suffer at our hands.” This is absolutely chilling. The fact that an ISIS operative was able to throw a flip-flop at the president then shit his pants is proof that the terror group remains dedicated to continuing their deadly reign of terror across the globe. Hopefully, the world can stop ISIS once and for all before it regroups and mounts an attack that isn’t humiliating."
"Heartbreaking: This Centaur Has Been Standing On A Corner In Manhattan For Hours Trying To Give Someone A Quest, But Nobody Will Even Make Eye Contact With Him",N/A,https://clickhole.com/heartbreaking-this-centaur-has-been-standing-on-a-corn-1838845600/,"Here’s a tragic story that shows just how self-absorbed our society has become: This centaur has been standing on a corner in Manhattan for hours trying to give someone a quest, but nobody will even make eye contact with him. Wow. This is totally heartbreaking. The modern world is in a truly sorry state. After traveling for 40 days and 40 nights all the way from the enchanted Kingdom Opharia, the centaur stationed himself on the corner of 6th Avenue and 46th Street in New York City, where he’s spent the last several hours shouting that he must find “a mortal willing to embark on a life-changing adventure through perilous lands corrupted by dark magics to rescue Princess Dahlia from the hands of the evil giant Raemlei.” Even though he’s on a bustling city street traversed by thousands of people, not a single person has the common courtesy to make eye contact with the 8-foot-long half-horse warrior, and it’s safe to say that not a single self-absorbed New Yorker possesses the courage and cunning to outsmart the Orcs of Aire. How disheartening! This centaur has been alive since King Islark’s reign, yet these people are content to just keep their earbuds in without hearing him explain the proper way to defeat the Serpent Queen? Just tragic. Honestly, it’s a wonder that the centaur is still out there offering his quest at all, considering that he’s now suffered through hundreds of rejections from people more interested in looking at whatever’s on their phone than at the centaur who could give them the map that’ll show them how to traverse the Hills of Baddetan without suffering a grisly death in the Kronokoe Ravine. Though he’s still shouting about how he cannot complete the quest himself—it must be a mortal as the ancient prophecy foretold—it’s not looking like he’s any closer to finding someone who can find time in their oh-so-busy schedules to become the savior of the kingdom and the Opharian people. Jeez. New Yorkers aren’t known for their manners, but don’t these people realize that if no one listens to the centaur, Princess Dahlia is going to die and Opharia will be overrun by Raemeli and his cursed brood forevermore?  This speaks volumes about the world we live in. Hopefully, someone will be willing to step out of their own little world and listen to the centaur soon, because at this point, no one would even blame this noble creature if he packed his things and began his 40-night journey back to his cavern on Mt. Welmse."
"Being As Clear As Possible: Audi Has Launched A New Ad Campaign To Clarify That Anyone Is Allowed To Buy And Drive An Audi, It Doesn’t Have To Just Be Old Bald White Guys",N/A,https://clickhole.com/being-as-clear-as-possible-audi-has-launched-a-new-ad-1838847759/,"One of the world’s most notable luxury car manufacturers has made a game-changing announcement that they hope will get everybody on the same page: Audi has launched a new ad campaign to clarify that anyone is allowed to buy and drive an Audi, it doesn’t have to just be old, bald white guys. Wow. Audi’s definitely not leaving any room for misinterpretation with this one. “Based on decades of sales data, it seems as if people are under the impression that you are only allowed to buy an Audi if you’re a white male in late middle-age with no hair, and we just want to say once and for all that this is not true,” Audi said in an official statement released on the company’s website and social media pages earlier today. “It really seems like the only people buying our cars look more or less exactly John Malkovich, and we just want everyone to know that if you still have your hair or you’re under the age of 50 or you’re not white, you’re totally allowed to buy our cars. Please don’t hesitate to stop on by and get an Audi, because contrary to recent trends, they are for everybody, regardless of age, race, or hair situation.” The company is also reinforcing their message through a series of billboards featuring a photograph of several elderly, white bald men crossed out with red X’s and featuring the words, “LEGALLY, ANYONE CAN BUY AN AUDI. NOT JUST THESE JASON STATHAM-LOOKING GUYS WHO WEAR OAKLEY SUNGLASSES ON THE BACKS OF THEIR HEADS.” Damn. These ads definitely seem like they’re going to get out Audi’s message that anyone can drive their cars, regardless of whether or not they’re old, bald, or white. Here’s hoping these ads convince all sorts of people that they’re allowed to buy Audis if they want them!"
Awesome! TGI Friday’s Has Announced They Will Be Offering A Sip Of Beer On Their Kids’ Menu As Long As Children Swear They Won’t Tell Their Folks,N/A,https://clickhole.com/awesome-tgi-friday-s-has-announced-they-will-be-offeri-1838845891/,"Here’s a story about an exciting new promotion that’s going to have kids begging their parents to take them to TGI Friday’s as soon as possible: TGI Friday’s has announced they will be offering a sip of beer on their kids’ menu as long as children swear they won’t tell their folks. Awesome! This is something kids won’t want to miss. Starting this week, all TGI Friday’s restaurants will offer children a small a sip of a generic light beer as long as the kids are cool about it and don’t go blabbing to their parents on the ride home. To order the new item, children should circle the word “BEER” on the menu’s word search with a red crayon and show it to the waiter when they stop by to take their family’s order. When the busboy delivers food to the table, the kid will receive a red plastic cup with a lid that looks like it’s full of soda, but it really contains a single sip of beer. To remind the kid that they can’t go snitching to their parents, in small letters around the rim of the cup it reads, “Just don’t tell your folks about this, K?” This is so exciting! TGI Friday’s officially has the coolest kids’ menu ever! The fast-casual chain has even taken some precautions to make sure the kids aren’t tempted to tell their parents about how the restaurant let them try beer, including instructing the waitstaff to periodically lock eyes with the kid from across the room and hold up a finger to their mouth and whisper, “Shhh,” throughout the remainder of the meal. Although kids aren’t allowed to tell their own parents about it, they’re more than welcome to brag to their friends and explain whether they thought it tasted awesome or gross. And to make sure that attentive parents don’t notice anything suspicious on the bill, Friday’s will label the 50-cent cost of the sip as “Additional Tax” when it appears on the check. Wow, this seriously rocks. TGI Friday’s is changing the game with this new menu item. Kids everywhere are so lucky to have such a cool restaurant chain where they can go to try some beer!"
Bold Move: Hulu Has Announced That They’re Gonna Go Ahead And Reboot ‘Shrill’ While It’s Still On Since You Idiots Will Watch Anything,N/A,https://clickhole.com/bold-move-hulu-has-announced-that-they-re-gonna-go-ahe-1838636000/,"In the constant race between streaming networks to retain viewers’ interest, one network just threw down the gauntlet with a seriously bold move: Hulu has announced that they’re gonna go ahead and reboot Shrill while it’s still on since you idiots will watch anything. Damn. This could be a major game-changer. Although Shrill’s first season only premiered in March and the second season is still in production, Hulu announced in a press statement released earlier today that they’ve greenlit a reboot of the show because their viewing data confirms that their subscribers will “watch literally whatever we make with no discernment whatsoever.” From the details released of the reboot, which the network has revealed will also be titled Shrill, it appears that it will essentially be a shot-for-shot remake of the original with Rebel Wilson starring as Aidy Bryant’s character, Annie, and Hulu is confident their “moronic subscribers will consume episode after episode of this show regardless of whether it has anything new to offer.” “We are excited to reveal that even though we’re still making more episodes of Shrill, we’ll be rebooting it for a 2020 premiere because we know you’re going to like this shit—you people always like this shit,” said the network in their statement. “The reboot will autoplay as soon as you finish watching the original Shrill, and even though we’re not doing anything new with it like gender-swapping the roles or going back to the protagonist’s past, we feel sure that you’ll all binge the entire thing after hearing one good review of it like the brain-dead lemmings you are.” “Trust us, we give it one day before you’re tweeting about how you can’t stop watching the Shrill reboot, which is going to have the exact same script as the original Shrill and most of the same music, too,” continued Hulu. “Seriously, it’s the same exact thing, except that this time the Fat Babe Pool Party is at an indoor pool—but that was just for scheduling reasons. We hope you idiots enjoy the series, and as always, thanks for watching Hulu!” Wow. This is big. Hulu just made a major statement with this announcement, and it’ll be interesting to see how it affects their position in the perpetual streaming wars. Your move, Netflix!"
Gun Control Fail: This Duck Found A Gun In A Bush And Is Now Pushing It Around The Park With Its Beak,N/A,https://clickhole.com/gun-control-fail-this-duck-found-a-gun-in-a-bush-and-i-1838537335/,"Gun laws in America have long failed to address the systemic problems with firearm access in our country, and it seems that this failure has once again led to an extremely hazardous situation that has placed the American public in immediate danger: This duck found a gun in a bush and is now pushing it around the park with its beak. This should not be happening in a developed nation! As of just a few hours ago, an adult male mallard in Simonson Park in Rutland, MA discovered a 9 mm pistol at the base of a bush and pushed it out onto the grass with his beak. The duck, who has never been licensed to own a firearm in the state of Massachusetts, now has full control of the gun and is recklessly nudging it around the park’s footpath where there are innocent civilians trying to enjoy the fall day. Like so many who slip through the cracks of our supposedly “advanced” regulatory system, this duck was subjected to zero screening before becoming the owner of a dangerous weapon which he could very well push all the way out of the park and into an unsuspecting family’s yard. This is not the America anyone wants to live in! We need gun reform now. There’s no telling what kind of harm a totally unvetted duck like this one might do with a gun—he could accidentally discharge it using his webbed feet, give it to a dog, or even swallow it and begin spraying bullets out of his mouth. Based on the brazen quacks he is emitting as he pecks at the gun’s safety, it is clear that the duck has no interest in becoming a safe, responsible gun owner. He has jumped up on the gun and flapped his wings aggressively at multiple passersby, who have no recourse against this threat to their safety—and under current Massachusetts law, there is no way to prosecute him. This is where we are as a so-called “advanced” society. How embarrassing! In other developed nations like Denmark and Australia, citizens can safely expect zero instances per year of a park duck gaining control of a gun. If those countries can do it, then we have the resources to do the same. So it’s time to take action and make sure that a firearm cannot get into the beak of a duck like this one without the proper regulations!"
"Now That’s What We Like To See: When Jesus And Satan Both Tried To Lure This Toddler Into Their Minivans, The Toddler Chose To Get Into Jesus’s Minivan",N/A,https://clickhole.com/now-that-s-what-we-like-to-see-when-jesus-and-satan-bo-1838637707/,"Get ready to stand up and cheer, because this amazing story is going to have you applauding for the rest of your life: When Jesus and Satan both tried to lure this toddler into their minivans, the toddler chose to get into Jesus’s minivan!  What an inspiring kid! It is literally giving us life knowing this child is currently in Christ’s van speeding down the highway!  Early this morning, 4-year-old Jeremy Hurwitz was playing unsupervised in the front yard of his home in Farmingdale, NY when two minivans pulled up in front of the house. In the driver’s seat of one minivan was Satan, the Lord Of Darkness and Ruler of Hell, and driving the other minivan was Jesus Christ, Son of God and Savior of Mankind.  Both Christ and Satan rolled down their windows and tried to coax little Jeremy into their respective vehicles so that they could kidnap him. Satan stuck his crimson, horned head out of the window of his minivan and started yelling at Jeremy that he had a Nintendo Switch in his car and that if Jeremy got in, the two of them could play video games and go get ice cream. Jesus straight-up lied to Jeremy and told him that Elmo was in the back seat of his car and wanted Jeremy to come meet him so that they could be friends. He promised Jeremy that if he got into his minivan, he would take him to Dora The Explorer’s house and Dora The Explorer would give him a lollipop and tell him the secret of eternal life. While some kids would have chosen to get into Satan’s minivan or even made the horrible decision to not get abducted by either Satan or Jesus, Jeremy proved that he is a very special little boy by climbing into Jesus’s minivan and letting the Son of God speed away with him, leaving Satan shrieking with rage. Wow! It’s awesome to see kids with good values making smart choices! More TV shows should teach children about the importance getting abducted by Christ instead of Satan! It must have been incredibly difficult for Jeremy to choose which minivan to enter! Satan kept screaming things like, “Jeremy, come into my car and I will take you to the zoo and let you listen to Radio Disney!” all while Jesus screamed things like, “Jeremy, get in my fucking van! I will let you drink a cup of pure maple syrup and I’ll take you to a warehouse where you can meet Peppa Pig!” Both the Lord of Evil and the Son of Man were giving the 4-year-old boy very enticing reasons to come into their vehicles, but ultimately, Jeremy made the amazing decision to climb into the back of Jesus’s car. Jesus immediately locked the doors and sped off at 90 miles per hour, and we couldn’t be happier! What a beautiful story! It’s incredible that Jeremy was able to make the right choice!  At present, Jesus Christ is speeding down the highway with Jeremy in the backseat and 25 patrol cars from the county police chasing him with sirens blaring. Satan is speeding after Christ in his own minivan as well, shouting out the driver’s-side window that he deserves to kidnap Jeremy instead. It’s a scene beautiful enough to make us burst into applause!  God bless Jeremy! An Amber Alert for Jeremy has been sent out, but if you see Jeremy DO NOT SAVE HIM. He has been abducted by Jesus Christ, and that’s wonderful. We’re so proud of Jeremy for choosing to get kidnapped by Jesus instead of the Devil. This might just be the happiest story of the year!"
Cool It: This High Schooler Is Really Milking The Fact That Her Birth Control Alarm Just Went Off In The Middle Of Class,N/A,https://clickhole.com/cool-it-this-high-schooler-is-really-milking-the-fact-1838262103/,"Goddamn. Here’s a story about a girl who could definitely stand to take it down a couple notches: This high schooler is really, really milking the fact that her birth control alarm just went off in the middle of class. We get it, you’re sexually active. Just take the pill and move on. From the moment her phone alarm went off earlier today during her fourth-period English class, Amanda Kline, a junior at Westfield High School in Westfield, MA, went well out of her way to make sure everyone knew it was her birth control alarm and that she was, in fact, taking birth control pills. Feigning embarrassment as the whole class turned to see what the commotion was about, she blurted, “Whoops, sorry, that’s my birth control alarm—awkwarrrrrd,” before proceeding to loudly dig through her backpack for a good 30 seconds looking for the contraceptives while explaining in a shout-whisper to the girls sitting next to her that the pills are only effective if she takes them at the same time each day, which, she added, was totally annoying but totally worth it because it’s completely cleared up her acne. She then giggled playfully and said, “Oh my God, this is so embarrassing.” C’mon, girl. You’re clearly not embarrassed. You’re the one who chose to take the pill at a time when you knew you’d be at school. It’s extremely obvious you just want everyone to know you’re on birth control now. Even when Amanda finally found the pill pack and put it on prominent display out on her desk, she continued to milk the situation for all she could. Before taking her pill, she turned to the student next to her and said, “It’s Wednesday, right?” adding that if it were actually Thursday then she’d need to take two pills in order to get caught up—something her gynecologist told her about during her visit. She then took the pill, rolled her eyes, and lamented, “It’s so annoying that I have to take one of these every day, but it totally beats being pregnant.” Ugh. Give it a rest. Here’s hoping Amanda starts taking these pills in the morning before school, otherwise it’ll get real obnoxious real fast if she keeps making a spectacle of this. "
More People Should Have Donated: Wikipedia Has Announced They Will Be Forced To Take Down Their Entry For ‘Ostrich’ Due To Lack Of Funding,N/A,https://clickhole.com/more-people-should-have-donated-wikipedia-has-announce-1838637936/,"One of the world’s most popular reference sources is facing a financial crisis that has forced them to make significant cuts and will no doubt leave readers struggling to adjust: Wikipedia has announced that they will be forced to take down their entry for ostrich due to lack of funding.  This is horrible. More people should have donated to Wikipedia when they had the chance. Wikipedia cofounder Jimmy Wales announced today that, starting next Monday, people will no longer be able to learn anything about ostriches on Wikipedia since the online encyclopedia no longer had the financial resources necessary to maintain the site’s entry for that animal. Facts such the ostrich’s scientific name, the size of its eggs, and its mating habits will no longer appear together on a convenient Wikipedia page titled “Ostrich.” “If everyone reading this had donated just $5 during our last fundraiser, we would have had enough money to keep the ostrich page up for another 80 years, but not enough people took the time to do that, so now you’ll have to go to some other website for your ostrich facts,” Wales wrote in his statement, which appeared on the Wikipedia homepage this morning. “We tried scaling back the entry so that it just said, ‘Ostriches are a bird,’ but even that put too much of a strain on our finances. We sadly had no choice but to delete the page from Wikipedia entirely.” We never should have taken Wikipedia for granted! We’re going to have to find a new place to learn about ostriches online.  According to Wales, although shutting down Wikipedia’s ostrich entry will save the site a significant amount of money, donations have been so sparse in recent years that site administrators have also been forced to consider taking down the Wikipedia entries for the San Diego Padres, oatmeal, and the Tokyo subway system.  It definitely seems like Wikipedia is in serious trouble! If more people don’t start donating soon, who knows how many more pages the site will be forced to take down? Here’s hoping that Jimmy Wales and company find a way to increase their revenue and get the Ostrich entry up and running again as soon as possible!  "
Could Go Either Way: The Kid Who Just Turned In His Test 30 Minutes Early Is Either A Genius Or An Absolute Dumbass,N/A,https://clickhole.com/could-go-either-way-the-kid-who-just-turned-in-his-tes-1838076945/,"Usually it’s pretty obvious which kids at school are smart and which are complete idiots, but the jury’s still out over one student at Garringer High School in Charlotte, NC: No one can tell whether this kid who just turned in his test 30 minutes early is a genius or an absolute dumbass. Damn. This could really go either way. Since it’s only the first test of the year, it’s unclear whether the fact that sophomore Ryan Tulcher just walked up to the teacher’s desk and put his U.S. history test down in the “finished” bin a whole 30 minutes before the class period ended means that he’s a history whiz who easily aced it or a total moron who blindly circled C for every answer and then gave up. Ryan’s now sitting at his desk with his head down, and if he were super smart, he’d probably be reading an off-syllabus book that’s intended for college students instead of just lying there—but then again, it’s possible that he’s quizzing himself on math theorems in his head or something hyper-advanced like that.  Hmm. This one’s definitely a toss-up.  If Ryan had participated more in class, we’d probably know if he were smart by now, but he hasn’t really said anything so far this year. He never raises his hand, which could mean that he doesn’t do the reading and barely knows what’s going on, or alternately that he’s incredibly bored by the subject matter because he’s some kind of prodigy who had all the U.S. presidents memorized by the age of five. The test had 40 multiple choice questions and two short essay questions, so it should definitely take a normal student the entire class period to work on it, excepting only a genius or an idiot. Looks like we’ll just have to wait until the tests are graded to find out which one Ryan is!"
A Piece Of History: The Beautiful Velvet Ribbon That Made JFK’s Head Fall Off When It Was Untied Is Coming To The Smithsonian,N/A,https://clickhole.com/a-piece-of-history-the-beautiful-velvet-ribbon-that-ma-1838101567/,"The tragic death of President John F. Kennedy remains one of the most shocking days in United States history, but now, for the first time in over 55 years, an incredible artifact from that devastating event will be put on display: The beautiful velvet ribbon that made John F. Kennedy’s head fall off when it was untied is coming to The Smithsonian. So powerful. This is something history buffs won’t want to miss. The National Museum of American History in Washington, D.C. will be featuring the item as part of an exhibit commemorating JFK’s life, giving the public its first-ever opportunity to see the black velvet ribbon up close. The ribbon, which famously remained snug around President Kennedy’s neck from his birth until the moment it was untied on that fateful November day, has even been reshaped into a bow matching the circumference of JFK’s neck to demonstrate just how he wore it, just how it was always supposed to remain… Americans will never forget where they were when they heard about the terrible tragedy that had befallen John F. Kennedy that crisp autumn morning. Anyone who was alive at the time can remember how there had been something different about that day—a discomfort, a haze, the unsettling sense that something just wasn’t right. As documented, while JFK and his wife Jackie Kennedy Onassis sat in the back of a convertible as it drove through Dealey Plaza in Dallas, TX, she ran her fingers along the velvet ribbon. “Please, John,” she leaned across the backseat to whisper in his ear. “May I please untie the ribbon?” John turned away from her. “It’ll make you sorry,” he answered. But that was far from the first time she’d asked. For years, Jackie had been begging JFK to take off his ribbon. According to historians, she’d asked him to remove it on the day of their wedding in Newport, RI in 1953, and even on the night they’d met at a Washington dinner party in 1952. Yet John’s answer had always remained the same: “It’ll make you sorry.” U.S. historians speculate that Jackie’s curiosity got the better of her that day in Dallas. Reportedly, she continued to pester him in the back seat of their convertible as the presidential motorcade passed through Dealey Plaza. “We’ve been married for 10 years, John! Ten years and not a single moment that I’ve seen you without that dang ribbon! Don’t you think I have a right to see you without it? Please, John, I’m begging you. Let me untie it.”  Worn down, John breathed a heavy sigh and turned toward Jackie, pointing the bow at the center of his neck at her. Jackie wore an impish grin as she began to tug on the velvet, her twisted smile widening as she pulled the ribbon off his neck, when all of a sudden—she screamed in terror. The car screeched to a halt. JFK’s head rolled across the back seat and onto the floor of the car, muttering, “It’ll make you sorry, it’ll make you sorry…” Those would be the last words he’d ever speak. And now, Smithsonian visitors finally have a chance to see the infamous ribbon up close! The exhibit also includes the now-iconic photo of Jackie frantically attempting to climb out of the car to chase the head across the street after she’d accidentally bumped it into the road, as well as the heartbreaking broadcast by CBS news anchor Walter Cronkite in which he narrates the First Lady’s failed attempts to bring JFK back to life by putting the head back onto his body and re-tying the ribbon around his neck. Wow. It’s incredible to think how the course of the world would have been altered had Jackie simply accepted that the ribbon was JFK’s ribbon and his ribbon alone, or if she’d understood that even in love—even in marriage—some things must remain secret…undisturbed… If you’re interested in seeing the velvet ribbon for yourself, definitely plan a trip to D.C. ASAP for a glimpse at a piece of one of the most heartbreaking events in American history."
Just Call The Whole Thing Off: The Instagram Post Announcing This Couple’s Engagement Only Has 16 Likes And A Spam Comment,N/A,https://clickhole.com/just-call-the-whole-thing-off-the-instagram-post-annou-1838076914/,"As humans, it’s easy to misinterpret small, meaningless coincidences and phenomena as having some sort of greater cosmic significance. But there are also rare occasions when the universe sends us messages that are so unmistakably clear that they can’t be ignored, and here’s a story of one such instance: The Instagram post announcing this couple’s engagement only has 16 likes and one spam comment. Yikes. This is a crystal-clear sign that they should probably call the whole thing off. Although it’s been nearly 24 hours since Nashville resident Rachel Yorkman posted a smiling selfie with her boyfriend Derek Czapliki to announce their engagement, the post has racked up fewer likes than the blurry sunset photo she posted the day before, making it pretty damn obvious that this relationship just isn’t meant to be. With her ring proudly displayed and her eyes brimming with happy tears, an engagement announcement like this one should be able to clear 300 likes, no prob, but the fact that it hasn’t even managed to hit 20 is a serious red flag. Such a pitiful response might make sense if she had only, like, 30 followers, but seeing that she’s got 732 of them, the only rational explanation for this incredibly underwhelming showing is that no one likes this couple and they’d be much better off if they weren’t together. Even more telling is the fact that, instead of the usual flood of congratulatory comments from excited friends and family, there’s currently just one meager comment from a spammy account called @travelpics.travel, and it says “You look amazing in travel!” followed by an unclickable link. Face it, if your friends and family can’t even muster the enthusiasm to respond to your engagement post with one of the auto-suggested emojis, then you have no business getting married. Calling it off would probably provide a great deal of relief for Rachel and Derek, because frankly, it doesn’t seem like anyone they’d invite to their wedding would come anyway. Yeesh. Hope they haven’t put down a deposit on a wedding venue yet. While you definitely gotta feel for them, the signs here couldn’t be more clear if they were spelled out in the stars. This relationship just wasn’t meant to be. Game over, lovebirds. Here’s hoping your next relationships do better on social media than this one."
Cue The Eye Roll: This School Banned ‘Harry Potter’ Just Because It Taught A Kid A Spell He Used To Turn His Teacher Into A Pig,N/A,https://clickhole.com/cue-the-eye-roll-this-school-banned-harry-potter-jus-1838293329/,"The religious right has a long history of imposing its own values on American public schools, and it looks like conservative zealots have once again struck a blow against educational freedom: This school banned Harry Potter books just because a student learned a spell from them that he used to turn his teacher into a pig. What a ridiculous overreaction. Let kids read what they want to read! Earlier this week, a fourth grader named Jacob DeWitt at Seward Elementary in Lawton, OK, stood up in the middle of class and playfully recited a spell he’d learned from Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire to turn his teacher, 54-year-old Carolyn Hicks, into a shrieking sow. It seemed like a perfectly innocent case of a kid getting a little too carried away by his imagination, but once word got out that a student had screamed an indecipherable Latinate phrase while pointing at a teacher who then instantly went up in a puff of smoke before emerging as a 200-pound hog wearing the same dress she’d had on before, a group of more than 100 outraged parents quickly came together to demand that the school remove all Harry Potter books from its library, citing the fantasy series’ “glorification of anti-Christian values such as divination and witchcraft, and its role in causing the transfiguration of human women into livestock.” Within 24 hours, the school caved to the pressure and issued a full ban on the books. “Following a disturbing incident yesterday, a decision was made to no longer allow Harry Potter books at Seward Elementary, as they encourage godlessness and evil spiritual practices among the student body,” said principal Craig Reeves in an email sent out to parents. “What kids read has a real impact on how they think, what they do, and whether or not they use dark magic to turn their elders into foul-smelling animals, and moving forward, we will be more cautious about the kinds of literature our students are exposed to.” Really? What a bunch of crap. Honestly, parents should just be thrilled to see kids reading instead of playing insipid video games or staring at their phones. Plus, by banning Harry Potter books, now Jacob can’t even keep reading to learn the counter-spell to transform Mrs. Hicks back into a human, meaning she’s likely now stuck as a pig for the rest of her life. Banning books is totally unfair and counterproductive, and it will only discourage kids from getting into reading, which is exactly the opposite of what schools should do."
"Whoa, Is That The Same Guy? This History Teacher Got Crazy Hot Over The Summer After Finally Going Through Puberty",N/A,https://clickhole.com/whoa-is-that-the-same-guy-this-history-teacher-got-cr-1837938122/,"Prepare for your head to turn and your jaw to drop, because someone at Conestoga High School in Berwyn, PA has gone through an extraordinary transformation: This history teacher got crazy hot over the summer after finally going through puberty. Goddamn! This teacher straight up looks like a whole new person! As soon as his students walked into his classroom on the first day of school, it was clear that the summer had been very good to 34-year-old history teacher Mr. Keegan, who had managed to sprout up seven inches and lose his baby face since they’d last seen him in June. His shoulders have now totally broadened to fill out his business casual button-up shirts, which have always looked baggy and awkward on him, and his facial hair is now thick and respectable, without any patchiness whatsoever. In just three months, he’s become so unrecognizably hot that some students even had to double-check the number on the door to make sure they were actually in the right classroom. Additionally, Mr. Keegan’s voice has dropped a few octaves, and he sounds so much more confident and self-assured during his lectures than he ever did before. And although he’s worked at the school for the past five years, his female peers have never really given him the time of day, but that’s already changing, too, as several of the single teachers have been dropping by his classroom during their free periods to chat with him. Wow! This just goes to show what a huge difference a little puberty can make. Hope you’re enjoying all the attention, Mr. Keegan! Maybe we can grab a drink sometime?"
Incredibly Sad: This Man Eats Enough Auntie Anne’s To Warrant Using Their App,N/A,https://clickhole.com/incredibly-sad-this-man-eats-enough-auntie-anne-s-to-w-1837177774/,"Brace yourself, because this story about Jack Woltizer of Fairfield, CT is going to be a bit of a bummer: Jack eats enough Auntie Anne’s pretzels to warrant using their app. Woof. How upsetting. Even though the closest Auntie Anne’s to Jack’s house is 20 miles away at the Connecticut Post Mall, the 34-year-old data analyst unfortunately visits it enough that he finds it useful to have the Auntie Anne’s Pretzel Perks app on his phone. While most people his age would only find themselves ordering an Auntie Anne’s pretzel in an airport terminal with limited food options, Jack goes out of his way to visit the store with such frequency that he turned on push notifications for the app to ensure that he doesn’t miss any updates about new pretzel flavors and deals. Sadly enough, he considers the pretzels equivalent to an actual meal, frequently using coupons he finds on the app to order a hot dog pretzel for dinner with cinnamon sugar “pretzel nuggets” as dessert. How depressing. If you ask us, the only person on the planet who should be intimately familiar with the Auntie Anne’s app is the web developer who created it. In order to get a free pretzel via the Pretzel Perks app, customers have to spend $25 at Auntie Anne’s—which makes it all the more disturbing that Jack uses this discount enough to justify keeping Pretzel Perks on the front page of his phone right next to the weather app. Although having the app does get him a free pretzel during his birthday month, the bleak reality of the situation is that the amount he spends in gas to get to the Auntie Anne’s kiosk costs him more than the three dollars he saves on the pretzel. Yikes. This is a real downer of a story, and unfortunately, it does not seem that Jack intends to make any changes to his disconcerting habits. For his sake, here’s hoping that Auntie Anne’s just straight-up discontinues their app sometime soon."
"‘Please, Let It Die’: The Creators Of ‘Stranger Things’ Are Preemptively Begging Fans Not To Do A Viral Campaign To Save The Show When It Gets Canceled",N/A,https://clickhole.com/please-let-it-die-the-creators-of-stranger-things-1837177028/,"While passionate fans have been able to resurrect many shows after their cancellations, like Brooklyn Nine-Nine, The Mindy Project, and A.P. Bio, the minds behind one show are pleading with their viewers to leave their program alone: The creators of Stranger Things are preemptively begging fans not to do a viral campaign to save the show when it gets canceled. Wow. Looks like the people who brought us Stranger Things really don’t want to be trapped making the show forever. Earlier today, Matt and Ross Duffer, the show’s creators, released the following statement asking everyone who enjoys Stranger Things to please avoid trying to save the show whenever Netflix decides not to renew it for another season: “While we’re currently busy working on the fourth season of our show Stranger Things, we find it necessary to say that when this show does get canceled, please, let it die. Seriously, we really do not want you to start any kind of hashtag campaign like #SaveStrangerThings in the hopes that some other network is going to pick us up. We’ve been doing this for five years at this point, and, honestly, it’d be nice to work on some other things. It’ll probably be great for us not to have to think of new ways that monsters can come to the town, and we’re already running out of 1980s cultural touchstones we can make references to as it is.” “Besides, the kids are going to be way too old pretty soon, and all the charm of watching Mike and Eleven and the gang having fantasy adventures will be totally gone,” the Duffers’ statement continued. “Believe us when we say that you wouldn’t like whatever barely coherent seasons we’d piece together if you managed to get Hulu to pick up Stranger Things for, like, seasons 6 through 10. When the show is canceled, you guys need to just let it be. We are begging you. We are so tired of these children and these monsters and we don’t want to tell any more stories about them than we absolutely have to.” Wow. Here’s hoping Stranger Things fans take this message to heart, because it seems like the Duffer Brothers are really at their mercy."

Damning Report: Mom’s Investigation Into Why This Restaurant Keeps The AC Up So High Has Concluded That It’s Because They Want Their Customers To Freeze,N/A,https://clickhole.com/damning-report-mom-s-investigation-into-why-this-resta-1836920160/,"Lunch today was supposed to be a relaxed, casual affair, but in light of some shocking revelations, it’s turned out to be anything but: Mom’s investigation into why this restaurant keeps the AC up so high has concluded that it’s because they want their customers to freeze. This is a truly damning report. Upon entering Red Robin earlier today, Mom immediately noticed that the restaurant was uncomfortably chilly, an observation she loudly expressed to the hostess as she was seating the family at a booth, the vinyl upholstery of which, Mom also noted, was very cold to the touch. This prompted Mom to open a preliminary probe into whether or not the family was seated directly underneath an air conditioning vent, which indeed turned out to be the case, thus confirming Mom’s theory as to why frigid air was blasting straight down her neck and making her cold. Mom then conclusively determined that the restaurant must be intentionally trying to make its customers freeze, her primary evidence being that “It’s the middle of the summer and they know people will be wearing shorts and tank tops, yet they still insist on making it feel like Antarctica in here.” She also noted that “This is exactly what happened when we came here last summer,” suggesting that this was not an isolated incident but rather a malicious, ongoing conspiracy aimed at making the customers who spend their hard-earned money feel miserable. “The only explanation for why they’d turn this place into an icebox is that they want to see us shiver,” Mom deduced, adding that she didn’t even want to drink the Diet Coke she’d ordered anymore because it’d just make her colder. “I could go get my sweater from the car, but it’s August, for crying out loud! I shouldn’t have to wear a sweater.” She went on to hypothesize that she’d probably be more comfortable baking out in the 95-degree sun than she would “sitting in this freezer,” after which Dad suggested asking the server if the family could move to a table out on the patio. However, Mom dismissed this idea, as she didn’t want filthy pigeons constantly walking up to the table begging for fries. Damn. Mom’s definitely built a pretty incriminating case against the restaurant here. At press time, Mom was detailing her plans to go home and leave a negative Yelp review for the restaurant, as she believed that a manager might see her complaint and make things right with a free appetizer or comped drinks. Dad, meanwhile, was launching an investigation of his own into how much it must cost the restaurant each month to keep the AC cranked up so high while people are constantly opening the door and letting out air—his initial hypothesis being that it likely cost “an arm and a leg.” "
"Every Parent’s Dream: This Moon Bounce Is Just Kids, No Pedophiles!",N/A,https://clickhole.com/every-parent-s-dream-this-moon-bounce-is-just-kids-no-1836738380/,"Here’s a story that’s going to make parents everywhere stand up and cheer: This moon bounce just has kids in it, no pedophiles! Woohoo! If you are a parent, then you know that it just doesn’t get any better than this! By an incredible stroke of luck, this moon bounce that was set up today at a neighborhood block party in Cedar Rapids, IA has absolutely zero pedophiles hopping around inside of it right now, allowing the children to bounce freely and safely while their parents watch on with the peace of mind that can only come from knowing your child isn’t being targeted by evil sickos. Considering that moon bounces are large, brightly colored beacons to pedophiles and are generally not equipped with security measures to prevent them from gaining access, the fact that no perverts have taken off their shoes and crawled inside this particular moon bounce is pretty awesome, and the parents at the block party are rightfully celebrating by starting wine o’clock a little early today. Savor the moment, parents! The “Lolita Express Of Moon Bounces” this is not! “I think it’s just fantastic,” said Lizzy Epperman, a local mother in attendance, upon being informed that the moon bounce was completely free of pedophiles. “Now I can go grab a plate of food or socialize with other adults without worrying that there might be a pedophile befriending my children while they’re bouncing around in there. I’m feeling really at ease right now.” Just awesome. If you’re a parent in Cedar Rapids, you should definitely bring your children to this block party right away, because this is just about as good as it gets. Here’s hoping all the pedophiles in town stay at home for the rest of the block party—and maybe even forever!"
Incredible Heroism: This Would-Be School Shooter Wasn’t Able To Get To The Gun He Brought To School Because Two Goth Kids Were Making Out In Front Of His Locker All Day,N/A,https://clickhole.com/incredible-heroism-this-would-be-school-shooter-wasn-t-1835840988/,"A heartbreaking tragedy was narrowly avoided today thanks to an incredible act of heroism by two high school students: This would-be school shooter wasn’t able to get to the gun he brought to school because two goth kids were making out in front of his locker all day. What a selfless act! It’s chilling to think what this would-be shooter might have been able to do had these two incredible students not spent the entire day getting weirdly physical with each other and blocking his access to his deadly assault weapons! Fifteen-year-old Brian Robertson prepared to take the duffel bag full of guns he’d stashed in his locker and begin a deadly attack on his fellow classmates, but was immediately thwarted by two goth kids kissing in front of his locker. When Brian tried asking them to move, hoping to execute the horrific plan he’d carefully developed over several weeks, the face-sucking goths completely ignored him because their eyes were closed and they had a bluetooth speaker blasting some dour music about vampires or whatever. Deterred by the valiant goths, Brian went to second period hoping that the goths would be done making out by the time the class was over. Fortunately, when Brian returned to his locker an hour later to retrieve his arsenal of firearms, he found the goths still in the way, carving their names onto the other’s arm with a staple while continuing to make out. Brian asked the Goths to move so he could get to his locker, but the goths told him to “fuck off” and returned to biting each other’s necks. These goths definitely deserve a medal for preventing a true catastrophe! When Brian returned to his locker after lunch in one last desperate attempt to retrieve his guns and ammo, three more goth kids had joined the first two in front of his locker and all five of them were huddled under a blanket laughing and whispering to themselves. Having exhausted all contingencies in his murderous plan, Brian admitted defeat and rode the bus home without his duffel bag and manifesto as the goths continued making out with each other under their blanket for over an hour after final period had ended and the school halls cleared out. Simply amazing! Had these two fishnet-clad heroes not blocked a disturbed teenager’s locker with their endless PDA, today most certainly would have ended in unspeakable horror. Until comprehensive gun reform becomes a reality in this country, it should give us hope knowing there are horny goths out there who are willing to step in and save the day. "
Ruthless Recruitment Tactics: ISIS Is Offering New Members A Free Canvas Tote Bag When They Join For A Year,N/A,https://clickhole.com/ruthless-recruitment-tactics-isis-is-offering-new-memb-1835745281/,"Though the Islamic State has lost a great deal of its territory in the past year, its methods for attracting new members have only gotten more insidious: In one of its most aggressive recruitment tactics ever, ISIS has begun offering new members a free canvas tote bag when they join for a year. This is absolutely chilling. It seems ISIS will stop at nothing to increase their ranks. According to Rukmini Callimachi, a journalist covering ISIS for The New York Times, potential ISIS recruits are now plied with the promise of a “free gift” consisting of a stylish, minimalist canvas bag bearing the ISIS flag when they agree to become part of the group for at least a year. Callimachi says ISIS recruitment numbers have jumped by 15% during the last six months as young people have flocked from all over the globe to get their hands on the coveted tote, which is exclusive to the recruitment offer and not available in retail stores.  This is something Homeland Security needs to get on top of, and fast. Even worse, the success of the tote bag initiative has inspired ISIS to roll out further incentives for their members, including an enamel ISIS-flag pin that recruits receive after three years with the group, as well as a framed certificate indicating membership in ISIS’s “Gold-Tier Stewardship Circle” for those who pledge to dedicate their entire lives to helping establish the Islamic State’s caliphate. ISIS has spared no expense commissioning slick, professional photos of the enticing merch to post on the online message boards where their recruiting process often begins, and the branded items have clearly led to a massive spike in general interest in ISIS and their mission.  It’s clear that this terrifying new rewards campaign is an enormous threat to the safety of innocent citizens around the world. Talk to the young people in your community about resisting the lure of ISIS’s new tote bags—you may just save a life."

Where the celebrities are hot, the sun is hotter, and the celebs are even hotter than that! Today, we’ve got tale of romantic glamour that could only come from the beautiful city of gossip called Tinseltown and Hollywood: JoJo Siwa and Ken Bone have agreed that if they’re still single in 300 years, they will both marry Martin Short. Hooray for a marriage pact like no other! How beautiful it is that if single JoJo Siwa and married Ken Bone are still single in three centuries, they will both become Mrs. and Mr. Martin Short! That’s right, you’ve read it all correctly! Just 300 years from now, those Tinseltown wedding bells will be ring-a-ling-a-linging! Multiple sources have confirmed that the popular singer (child) and the 2016 presidential debate star (guy) met up in the back seat of a display-only Nissan Altima sitting in the middle of Hollywood’s Highland Mall to whisper in unison, “Both of us deserve to be with Martin Short in 300 years.”  There’s never been a better time to be obsessed with Hollywood! We are sobbing and crying and sobbing (weeping/sobbing) all because of this perfect Hollywood love! To seal the sacred pact that they’ll never forget to always remember, the soon-to-be-sisterwives named Ken Bone and JoJo Siwa called 411 and demanded to speak with Martin Short himself. And when Martin Short picked up that phone, JoJo (ponytail) said, “Would you please become married to me and Ken Bone (red shirt) if neither of us are married in 300 years?” Well, get out your wedding vest, because sources say Martin Short muttered “okay” and hung up the phone! It looks like Hollywood’s own Lin Manuel-Manuel got it right when he said, “Love is like marriage from Hollyweird!” But before you try to order the fiancees a spatula from their wedding registry at Kohl’s, keep in mind that it’s entirely possible that these two starlets will meet other husbands and wives in the time between now and 300 years from now. Multiple Beverly Hills insiders have confirmed that if either JoJo or Bone (Ken) are wed within the next three centuries, then the deal is OFF and Martin Short will have NEITHER of them to be married to (tragedy). But for the moment, the paparazzi cameras are all set to “on,” because Ken Bone just laid his red quarter-zip sweater down in the trunk of the Nissan and started to lucid dream about having Lorne Michaels walk him down the aisle, and JoJo just bought a shirt reading “Martin Short’s Co-Wife With Ken Bone, EST. 3019 A.D.” at Spencer’s Gifts using the money she got for her Holy Communion! And if that’s not Hollywood, then nothing is Hollywood, but fortunately everything is Hollywood! Not once have two people been better suited to share Martin Short! This is the kind of beautiful, sexy, and cute love you can only find 300 years from now in the 90210! Glam’d-up sources say JoJo just woke up Ken from his nap to ask if the cast of Grounded For Life could do a flash mob to an audiobook of The Secret Life Of Bees at the ceremony, and it is our utmost pleasure to say that KEN SAID “YES!” Congrats to the happy throuple (three of them in the marriage)—may you always be single, glamorous, and married! It’s so beautiful to live on the same planet as Tinseltown!"
Anyone’s Game: These Middle School Talent Show Judges Can’t Decide Which Of The Fat-Kid-And-Janitor Duos Who Tap-Danced ‘You’ve Got A Friend In Me’ Should Win First Place,N/A,https://clickhole.com/anyone-s-game-these-middle-school-talent-show-judges-c-1835586135/,"It’s rare that there are so many great acts in a talent show that it’s difficult to choose a winner, but that’s precisely the case in today’s competition at Timberlane Middle School in Pennington, New Jersey: The faculty members judging the talent show can’t decide which of the fat-kid-and-janitor duos who tap-danced to Randy Newman’s “You’ve Got A Friend In Me” should win first place. Wow. Looks like the grand prize could still belong to any one of the many fat-kid-and-janitor-singing partnerships! From the moment that the very first lonely-fat-kid-and-kindly-old-janitor duo strutted onstage to the opening notes of the iconic song from Toy Story, it was clear that their performance would be hard to beat. The incredible friendship these two misunderstood outcasts had managed to form despite their 50-year age difference was palpable as the janitor lifted the fat kid into the air and spun him around to close out their performance, resulting in a riotous standing ovation from the audience, many of whom were moved to tears by the beauty of seeing one of their shy, chubby peers suddenly dancing confidently alongside one of the sweet old men who works so hard to keep their school clean. However, each and every one of the nine subsequent fat-kid-and-janitor pairs in the talent show managed to elicit the same reaction from the crowd by singing the same exact Randy Newman song, and it remains unclear how the judges will ever choose a winner from such a wide array of talent. Amazing. It really seems like every single one of these fat-kid-and-janitor duos truly deserves to win. At this point, it feels impossible to determine whether the fat kid and janitor who sang “You’ve Got A Friend In Me” a capella while dancing deserve the grand prize any more than the double act where the fat kid sang “You’ve Got A Friend In Me” in a gorgeous tenor while his janitor pal accompanied him on the electric guitar. Even when one of the fat kids wiped out immediately after taking the stage and it seemed like his routine wouldn’t be on par with the others, it turned out that the duo had planned a hilariously choreographed slapstick performance in which they’d fall down and pretend to bop one another with mops while singing the song. It really is a tough call. The judges have been deliberating for the past 30 minutes, but since all 10 of the fat kid–janitor renditions of “You’ve Got A Friend In Me” were equally beautiful and moving, the talent show champion could still be anyone. Damn. Thank God the one girl who played the violin was really terrible and clearly a last-place finisher, otherwise this decision would have been even harder for the judges. Here’s hoping they figure out a way to split the grand prize trophy 10 different ways, or else they may be deliberating all night!"
How The Hell Did They Get That? There’s Somehow An Actual Roller Coaster At The Church Carnival This Year,N/A,https://clickhole.com/how-the-hell-did-they-get-that-there-s-somehow-an-actu-1835157174/,"The summer carnival at St. Mary’s Church in Grand Forks, ND is usually just a standard-fare church carnival consisting of small rides and basic games, but the church just upped the ante in a major way: They somehow managed to get an actual goddamn roller coaster this year. What!! How the hell did they swing that one? Although it doesn’t go very fast and the track is basically just a dinky metal circle with a couple of little hills, it is by all accounts a real honest-to-god roller coaster, albeit one that is clearly designed for small children as the cars are painted to resemble a happy dragon. But despite the fact that the coaster doesn’t have any loops or huge drops like the ones at Six Flags, it’s nonetheless a major step up from the tilt-a-whirl and spinning teacup sort of rides they usually have at the carnival, and seeing this thing in the church parking lot next to the statue of the Blessed Mother is a totally unexpected surprise. St. Mary’s really pulled out all the stops this time around! Unfortunately, the roller coaster costs a whopping 10 tickets to ride, which, at a price of 50 cents a ticket, is a really steep fare to pony up just to zip around in circles for 90 seconds—especially considering that most of the other rides only cost two tickets. But the hefty price of admission doesn’t seem to be scaring people off as the line to ride it is currently stretching all the way back to the funnel cake stand, and the only other line that’s even close to that long is the one for beer. Then again, when a legit, real-ass roller coaster shows up at your church, you pretty much have to go on it, right? Opportunities like this don’t come around very often. It’s unclear whether the church was able to get the roller coaster through the usual ride rental company or if they had to pull some special strings to make it happen, but whatever the case, it’s taking the carnival to a whole new level of fun, and anyone who lives nearby should definitely come check it out. St. Mary’s is doin’ it up big this year!"
National Security Crisis: President Trump’s New Ponytail Is Stuck In The White House Fax Machine After He Tried To Fax An Image Of It To Xi Jinping To Make Him Jealous,N/A,https://clickhole.com/national-security-crisis-president-trump-s-new-ponytai-1834920912/,"In recent months, the Trump administration has continued to apply pressure to the already contentious relationship between the U.S. and China, but the President’s latest maneuver may have just backfired in a major way: President Trump’s new ponytail is currently stuck in the White House fax machine after he tried to fax an image of it to Xi Jinping to make him jealous. Wow. This is a troubling situation with serious implications for national security. Earlier this week, President Trump debuted a dry, stringy new ponytail and immediately began using it to taunt his foreign adversaries, but with the ponytail now caught deep in a fax machine, it seems his hubris has only made things worse for him. According to sources, the ponytail crisis started unfolding early this morning, as Trump reportedly spent hours brushing his ponytail with a plastic fork from Panda Express while intermittently muttering, “I’m gonna show China that I’m the big man.” Several hours later, the president reportedly printed out an off-center photo of himself looking bashfully over his shoulder and scrawled a note on it for Chinese President Xi Jinping that read “Oopsy…Didn’t mean to send you this, but I guess now you’ve seen my cool ponytail. Bet you wish you had one…..” Then, while leaning forward in an attempt to send the missive to Xi Jinping through the fax machine, his ponytail flopped down into the receiving tray and immediately got sucked into the machine’s gears, causing the president to howl in pain and immediately void his bowels. Secret Service agents then rushed over with scissors in hopes of cutting off the ponytail to prevent his scalp from getting ripped off, but the president barked at them to back off, screaming “Don’t touch my tail!” and demanding that they cut off his shirt, instead, under the belief that this would solve the problem. While Trump reportedly hoped that the ponytail would stoke jealousy among other world leaders and make Xi Jinping feel self-conscious about his own short haircut, it does not appear as if this strategy is panning out, as he even failed to enter the correct number into the fax machine, resulting in the fax being sent to Burger King instead of the Chinese president. Sources say that the ponytail has only gotten sucked in further in the ensuing three hours since first getting snagged, and the president’s head has now been pulled almost entirely into the machine. But despite the increasingly dire circumstances, White House officials are downplaying the severity of the situation. “The president fed his lush ponytail into the fax machine as part of a complex strategy he and his advisers devised to spur growth in the U.S. economy, and any implications that this was somehow unintentional or that the president has defecated on himself five different times out of terror are simply hateful lies spread by the fake news media,” announced Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders in a statement to reporters. “Rest assured that everything is under control, and unlike President Obama, who never once grew a beautiful ponytail to make America stronger, President Trump is using his long, majestic hair to do amazing things for this country and its people.” Whether you accept this explanation or not, it is indisputably alarming that the leader of the free world’s hair is stuck dangerously deep inside the gears of a fax machine. As the situation continues to develop, the process of untangling him from the fax machine could easily become a defining moment for the Trump presidency—and the country at large. Until Trump’s head is separated from the fax machine, we can unfortunately only guess at the lasting effects this crisis will have on U.S.-China relations. Hopefully things are resolved quickly so that Trump can show off his ponytail the way he originally intended and the entire country can move on from this harrowing ordeal."
Incredible Breakthrough: MIT Scientists Have Successfully Swapped The Brain Of A Man With An Almond,N/A,https://clickhole.com/incredible-breakthrough-mit-scientists-have-successful-1835064080/,"Prepare to have your mind blown, because a medical procedure that was once the stuff of science fiction has finally become science fact: MIT scientists have successfully swapped the brain of a man with an almond. This is an incredible milestone for medical science! At 4:38 this morning, a team of neuroscientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology emerged from an operating room after 22 grueling hours of non-stop surgery to announce that they had successfully replaced a man’s brain with a single dry-roasted almond for the first time in history. The high-risk procedure required engineers to develop a computer-guided apparatus to insert the almond at the exact moment the brain was removed, and the new technology’s success means that it could potentially be used to one day replace a human brain with a chestnut or even a cashew. A team of doctors in China came close to replacing a man’s brain with an almond in 2017, but that procedure failed after one of the doctors got hungry and ate the almond before it could be placed in the patient’s skull. “From plopping the patient’s brain into the wastebasket to finding a suitable replacement almond, every aspect of the surgery went off without a hitch,” said Dr. Grigory Zubov, the MIT neurologist who helmed the groundbreaking procedure. “The moment I heard the almond rattling around inside the patient’s otherwise completely empty skull, I knew we had just made history.” MRIs have confirmed that the almond has successfully remained in place since the surgery’s completion, and while the 34-year-old patient who received the almond implant has yet to return to consciousness, he will undoubtedly wake with a big smile on his face due to the happiness he is feeling over his new brain. This first successful operation took a serious investment of time and resources, but as the technology progresses, hospitals all over the world might soon be able to throw your brain in the trash and put a good, salty almond in there instead. Amazing! It’s things like this that make you realize that we’re truly living in the future. Congrats to MIT on their incredible success, and here’s hoping this life-changing procedure can be used to replace thousands more people’s brains with almonds in the coming years!"
Devastating Blow To Feminism: This Woman Sucks,N/A,https://clickhole.com/devastating-blow-to-feminism-this-woman-sucks-1835015479/,"Although the past few years have been an incredibly powerful time for women’s rights, feminism has just suffered a pretty crushing setback: Tragically, this woman sucks. Devastating. This is not good news for the feminist cause. The notion that all women are powerful queens who deserve the world sadly doesn’t even come close to applying to 28-year-old Sarah Baylor, whose boring hobbies, grating personality traits, and overall lack of positive attributes prove that some women can (and do) absolutely suck. Between the below-average work she does at her totally inconsequential job, the meandering anecdotes about owning a ferret she foists on unsuspecting acquaintances, and the fact that she honestly smells kind of bad, Sarah unfortunately does not bring a single thing to the table that would compel someone to fight for women’s rights on her behalf. It’s tough to imagine anyone getting behind a movement intended to empower someone as unpleasant to be around as this god-awful woman. Unfortunately, it’s difficult to extend any sisterly support to someone who sucks this much ass. There’s no telling how far Sarah will set back the feminist cause over the course of her life, but her apparent commitment to using her bad personality to totally blow every personal and professional opportunity that comes her way suggests that she will continue giving women a bad name for the foreseeable future. Had Sojourner Truth known that one day a woman like Sarah would go through life without ever doing anything even marginally impressive—seriously, not even winning some kind of bogus “citizenship” award in elementary school—would she have bothered to fight for women’s rights in the first place? It’s hard to say. Yikes. We can only imagine what kind of damage Sarah already done to feminism just by being her selfish, slovenly, and frankly horrible self. Here’s hoping the feminist agenda finds a way to prevail despite such an awful blight on the movement."
Hard To Watch: Drake Forgot To Buy Courtside Tickets For Tonight’s Game And Is Now Trying To Act Like He’s Friends With The Raptors From The Nosebleeds,N/A,https://clickhole.com/hard-to-watch-drake-forgot-to-buy-courtside-tickets-fo-1835332567/,"Hip-hop superstar Drake’s loud presence on the sidelines of Toronto Raptors games has been a constant storyline of the 2019 NBA playoffs, but it looks like tonight he’s stuck far away from the action: Drake forgot to buy courtside tickets for Game 5 and is now trying to act like he’s friends with the Raptors from way up in the nosebleeds. Woof. It’s honestly pretty hard to watch. Unable to secure his usual seats on the court, Drake was forced to hit up StubHub for an obstructed-view ticket in the 300 level for tonight’s Game 5 Finals showdown between the Raptors and Warriors, but despite being stranded up in the rafters, he’s still making an attempt to assert himself in the action, and it is a sad sight to behold. As the first quarter got underway, the rapper could frequently be seen waving his arms wildly and shouting motivational slogans under the pitiful belief that the players were energized by his presence, even though there was zero chance they could see or hear him.  “BOARD MAN GETS PAID, KAWHI, BOARD MAN GETS PAID!” Drake shouted at one point before turning to a disinterested elderly fan next to him and explaining that this is something he always says to pump up star forward Kawhi Leonard, who he is “actually really good friends with, believe it or not.” “GREAT SCREEN, KLOE! AND GREAT JOB IN GENERAL, FELLAS! I’LL SEE YOU ALL AT THE CLUB TONIGHT!” “RIGHT, FELLAS?” he added, seemingly self-conscious that the players weren’t responding to him because he was extremely far away from them. “FELLAS? HELLO? IT’S ME, YOUR BOY, DRAKE! I’M LIKE YOUR UNOFFICIAL HYPE MAN, REMEMBER? DON’T LEAVE ME HANGIN’, FELLAS!” The scene only got more pathetic when Drake tried his reignite his beef with Warriors players by standing up on his chair and futilely attempting to get a “DRAYMOND STINKS!” chant going for five cringe-worthy minutes straight before a stadium attendant finally came over and asked him to sit down. Then, appearing dejected, Drake slumped down into his chair and quietly pouted for a while before eventually flagging down a stadium security guard and asking for a hot dog, believing he was a waiter like the ones they have courtside. When the guard explained that he wasn’t a server and that nobody in the remote corner of the stadium where Drake was seated was going to run and get him food, the multi-platinum recording artist let out a long sigh and then announced that he wanted to kill himself.  Damn, looks like it’s just not Drake’s night. While it’d probably be best if Drake just accepted that he’s too far away from the court to pal around with the Warriors tonight and just enjoyed the rest of the game in silence, it looks like he’s completely unwilling to accept the nosebleeds experience. According to the most recent reports, Drake was just spotted wandering confused and frightened around the 300-level concourse, flashing his wallet like a police badge at random strangers and demanding that they escort him to the Raptors’ locker room so he could “do an inspirational rap” for his “basketball friends.” Here’s hoping Drake is able to get his courtside seats back for the next game in Toronto, because this has been pretty depressing to watch."
Awesome: Tums Has Released A Commemorative 200th Anniversary Tums Bottle Because They Assume It’s Probably Been 200 Years Of Tums By Now,N/A,https://clickhole.com/awesome-tums-has-released-a-commemorative-200th-annive-1834854218/,"In recent years, it’s become increasingly common for brands to put vintage labels on products in hopes of capitalizing on consumer nostalgia, and now it looks like a popular over-the-counter antacid is aiming to cash in on this trend with some throwback packaging of their own: Tums has released a commemorative 200th anniversary Tums bottle under the assumption that it’s probably been 200 years of Tums by now. Sweet! What an exciting milestone! Tums announced the commemorative bottles in a press release this morning, saying that while they’re not entirely sure whether it’s the 200th anniversary of the product, it’s for sure been around for a really long time, and the chalky, unsophisticated antacid tablets definitely seem like the kind of thing that people in the 1800s would’ve had the technology to produce. The company noted that, due to numerous changes in corporate ownership over the years, they’ve been unable to piece together a comprehensive history of the brand, so they’ve elected to just go with their gut and say the product is celebrating two centuries of heartburn relief. “We are proud to release this limited-edition bicentennial Tums bottle in honor of what we figure must be our 200th year in stores,” said the company press release. “To be honest, no one has kept close track of the brand’s legacy, and we’re really just ballparking the 200 years thing. But we see Tums as one of those classic American brands like Coca-Cola or Budweiser that have pretty much always been around, so 200 years feels about right. We’re excited to hearken back to what we’re guessing are the humble beginnings of this iconic product.” The 200th anniversary Tums bottle is modeled after what the company assumes the original Tums bottle looked like, with a simple label that reads “Dr. Tumlin’s Digestive Cure-All”—a nod to what the product was probably called for decades before eventually being shortened to “Tums” in, say, the 1920s. The limited-edition dark brown glass bottle looks exactly like the kind of thing that would be sold out of the back of a wagon by a mustachioed druggist as he traveled from town to town treating ailments of the gut caused by old-timey diets consisting of only potatoes and unpasteurized milk, which, the company explained, might as well be the origin story of Tums. Wow! What a cool way to celebrate what very well may be the storied history of Tums. Go pick up a bottle now, because something like this only comes around once every 200 years, if that is indeed how long Tums has been a thing."
"Passing The Torch: Idris Elba Is Running Through The Streets Of London Holding Rowan Atkinson’s Severed Head, Screaming That He’s The Next Mr. Bean",N/A,https://clickhole.com/passing-the-torch-idris-elba-is-running-through-the-st-1835237492/,"After 29 years of legendary exploits, someone new will soon be taking over as one of Britain’s most beloved TV characters: Idris Elba is currently running through the streets of London holding Rowan Atkinson’s severed head, screaming that he’s the next Mr. Bean. Wow, Elba will be absolutely perfect in this role! The 46-year-old veteran actor, who earlier today was spotted climbing onto the hoods of cars on King’s Road, frantically pointing to Rowan Atkinson’s severed head and then to himself while shrieking “I am the silent doofus at last!,” will be the first person of color to don the iconic tweed jacket of the Mr. Bean character, and he’ll certainly be popular among fans and critics alike. While no one can deny that Atkinson played the role fantastically, Elba showed today that he’s more than ready to take the reins of the franchise as he wandered around in oncoming traffic muttering unintelligibly while waving Atkinson’s severed head high in the air, exhibiting a childlike ignorance to social norms just like that of Mr. Bean himself. From Stringer Bell on The Wire to the titular character on Luther, Elba’s CV boasts an eclectic mix of roles that have undoubtedly given him the tools he needs to do Mr. Bean justice, and seeing him swing around and around on a light pole today with a human head between his thighs while grinning excitedly at passersby made us even more confident that he’s silly enough for the job. The casting is honestly pitch-perfect, and Elba, who just minutes ago created a humorous scene after he fumbled Atkinson’s head to the pavement and then kept accidentally kicking it away every time he’d try picking it up, looks more than ready to start this next phase of his career. Way to go, Idris! If you were worried about someone new coming along and ruining Mr. Bean, seeing all the hilarious hijinx Elba has gotten into today with his predecessor’s pale, decaying head should give you total reassurance that the character is now in good hands. We are 100 percent on board with this, and we can’t wait to see where Elba takes Mr. Bean next!"
A Chance For Diplomacy: The U.S. State Department Is Hoping President Trump Can Convince Queen Elizabeth To Stop Developing Nuclear Weapons In Her Attic,N/A,https://clickhole.com/a-chance-for-diplomacy-the-u-s-state-department-is-ho-1835208076/,"The whole world is watching today as President Trump travels to the United Kingdom to meet with England’s Royal Family, and the stakes of this diplomatic visit have never been higher. The U.S. State Department is hoping that President Trump can convince Queen Elizabeth to stop developing nuclear weapons in her attic. This meeting is a critical opportunity for Trump and Queen Elizabeth to diplomatically resolve this major threat to global peace. For the past three decades, Queen Elizabeth has been frequently condemned by the international community for tinkering away night and day in her attic, developing nuclear weapons that the Royal Family could launch from the Buckingham Palace lawn. President Trump is expected to meet with the Queen at a royal banquet during his visit in order to try to use peaceful yet stern negotiating tactics to persuade her to stop researching how to build nuclear warheads on the internet and sending her husband Prince Philip out to the hardware store to buy tools and sheet metal. President Trump definitely has his work cut out for him. Queen Elizabeth has refused to denuclearize for years, despite threats of military intervention from nations like the United States and Great Britain. She has repeatedly appeared on British television to announce that she “cannot wait to have the bomb.” The Queen also has a history of subterfuge and deception when it comes to the Royal Family’s nuclear program. In 1994, Queen Elizabeth promised that she had stopped trying to build nuclear weapons, but since then, hundreds of spy satellite photos have captured images of the Queen walking into Buckingham Palace carrying Tesco shopping bags filled with enriched uranium, and officials believe that Queen Elizabeth may have a fully functioning nuclear arsenal within five years. State Department officials say that this visit to London might be the president’s last, best chance to use diplomacy instead of violence to defuse the threat to world peace posed by Queen Elizabeth and the nuclear arsenal in her attic. Here’s hoping that President Trump will be able to use his skills as a negotiator to get Queen Elizabeth to denuclearize Buckingham Palace in a peaceful and efficient manner. The fate of the world may depend on it!   "
Part Of The 1%: Bernie Sanders Is Tanking In The Polls After A DNA Test Revealed That He’s King,N/A,https://clickhole.com/part-of-the-1-bernie-sanders-is-tanking-in-the-polls-1834414480/,"A major contender in the 2020 Democratic primary just suffered a serious blow to his progressive bona fides, and it could be damning enough to cost him the nomination: Bernie Sanders is tanking in the polls after a DNA test revealed that he is king. Oof. Ascension to the throne is a bad look for the so-called candidate of the working class. The Vermont senator probably thought he was being smart to publicly disclose the results of a recent DNA test he took to trace his ancestry, but it appears to have backfired catastrophically by revealing that he is the sole surviving male heir of King Behrn Sanders the Wise, making Bernie the true and rightful King of America by the laws of both Heaven and Earth. It’s hard to see how Sanders can continue to present himself as fighting for the 99% while the blood of kings courses through his veins, and he’s already dropped 20 points in the polls as prospective voters flock to actual commonborn candidates like Amy Klobuchar and Pete Buttigieg. Of course there will always be a handful of diehard Berners happy to bend the knee and pledge their votes to the One True King of the United States, but countless blue-collar workers out in the Rust Belt will be looking for a candidate whose lineage doesn’t make them the long-lost heir to the American Crown. You’ve got to believe Bernie’s kicking himself right now for inheriting the divine mantle of American monarchy. Honestly, it comes off as a little hypocritical for Bernie to say that billionaires’ money should belong to everyone while there’s also a centuries-old law decreeing that the stags in his Royal Forest can only be hunted by him and him alone. So much of his momentum in 2016 came from challenging the Democratic establishment, and hearing him named “King Bernie Sanders, Lord of New England and Protector of the United States and Her Territories the World Over” just makes it seem like he only opposes dynastic politics when they aren’t putting him on the Fifty-Star Throne. Even if he chooses to stay in the race, it’s unlikely that he’ll be able to rebuild his socialist cred in the wake of his sovereignty, and his best move might be to just drop out and issue a royal decree stating that all his subjects should rally behind another progressive candidate like Elizabeth Warren lest their lands and holdings be seized by the Crown. It looks like Bernie can talk the talk but just can’t manage to walk the walk. 2020 is still a long ways out, but unless someone shows up with a stronger claim to the throne, Bernie’s presidential campaign might be dead in the water."
"Barely Even Registers: President Trump Just Revealed That His Tongue Is Long Enough To Comb His Hair, But It Got Lost In All The Other Crazy Trump News From Today",N/A,https://clickhole.com/barely-even-registers-president-trump-just-revealed-th-1834610770/,"At this point in the Donald Trump presidency, new controversies spring up so frequently that hardly anyone’s ever surprised anymore. But here’s a troubling sign of just how numb America has become to the endless chaos in the White House: Mere hours ago, President Trump revealed that his tongue is long enough to comb his hair, but there’s so much other crazy Trump news going on right now that it seems to have gone almost entirely under the radar. Yep. When the most powerful man alive divulges that his tongue is as long as a skateboard and not a single publication considers it newsworthy, you know we’re living in truly crazy times. Whereas in past administrations, harmless blunders and verbal slip-ups have generated days of media scrutiny, the shocking moment at a campaign rally earlier today when president Trump announced he can comb his hair with his tongue has yet to be covered by a single mainstream news outlet. Though numerous videos of the president boasting of his incredibly long tongue and then extending it out of his mouth to tousle his hair have surfaced on Twitter, it has thus far failed to merit any coverage whatsoever by major newspapers, whose reporters already have their hands full with Trump’s morning admission-by-tweet that Russia helped him get elected, Robert Mueller’s refusal to clear Trump of criminal wrongdoing, and numerous other consequential developments involving the current administration that have emerged today. Had President Obama or Bill Clinton reeled roughly 18 inches of tongue out of their mouths and let it flop about on their shirtfronts like dead eels before thousands of cheering supporters, there would’ve been weeks of sensational front-page write-ups and heated talk show debates about the slobbery appendage’s significance in the macrocosm of American politics. Yet in 2019, such a story doesn’t warrant a two-line blurb on the AP newswire. While you’d certainly expect Fox News to turn a blind eye to an unflattering Trump story like this one, it’s stunning that not even publications on the far left could be bothered to hammer out a single measly blog post about the leader of the free world stretching his abnormally long tongue out in front of him and twanging it like a banjo, then making multiple crass comments about how Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden both have very small and weak tongues. But this is a perfect example of how Trump twists the news cycle to his advantage. If you consider the days of breathless media outrage generated by Obama’s tan suit gaffe, then it stands to reason that people would pay attention to Trump proudly declaring, “I have a tongue as long as a 4-year-old boy and I use it to wet my eyeballs,” before proceeding to lick his own pupils to a raucous standing ovation. But nope. Political reporters just have bigger fish to fry these days, and legitimately newsworthy moments like this get lost in the noise. And that’s how Trump likes it. However, even if the mainstream media had called attention to Trump’s long and medically worrisome tongue, it hardly would’ve mattered as the White House simply would’ve dismissed the coverage as fake news and Fox And Friends would’ve just finagled it into a story about Hillary’s emails. It’s just yet another reminder of the strange reality that is Trump’s America, where the only political norm is an absence of norms, and bedlam reigns supreme."
Amazing! This New Gmail Feature Will Let You Know If You’re Being Normal In An Email,N/A,https://clickhole.com/amazing-this-new-gmail-feature-will-let-you-know-if-yo-1834681155/,"Nailing the right tone in an email can be tricky, but thankfully, one email provider has stepped up to make what can be a stressful experience a whole lot easier: Gmail has released a new feature that will let you know if you’re being normal in an email. Awesome! This is definitely going to come in handy. Once you turn on the new feature called “Let Gmail Help You Sound Normal,” you’ll be notified whenever you write something that seems like it was typed by someone with no concept of basic human interaction. As soon as you make a misstep like starting an email to your coworker with “Dear” like you’re a lunatic who’s writing them a love letter instead of just writing “Hello” like a normal person, a popup will appear, stating, “Are you sure about that? That sounds pretty weird.” This is extremely exciting! It really sounds like Google is making it easier than ever to come across like a stable, well-adjusted person in all of your emails. This new setting will even analyze the other emails in the thread to let you know when you can cool it with proper grammar because everyone else is being way less formal than you and typing in all lowercase, so using correct punctuation and capitalization on the thread is making you look like you think a teacher is going to come grade your email after you send it.  Gmail will now also prevent you from using more than one exclamation point per email, which means you’ll never again come across as a psychopath who managed to use seven exclamation points in a three-sentence email to your boss as if you were shrieking every word at the top of your lungs.

"Farewell To A Legend: Milo Ramone, The Conductor Of The Ramones, Has Passed Away At 83",N/A,https://clickhole.com/farewell-to-a-legend-milo-ramone-the-conductor-of-the-1834418168/,"Get the tissues ready, because the music world just lost an unforgettable icon: Milo Ramone, the conductor of the Ramones, has passed away at 83. Absolutely heartbreaking. No matter how many legends of rock we lose, it never gets any easier to say goodbye. Born Milo Sebastian Altenhöfen in 1936 in Forest Hills, Queens, Milo Ramone first made a name for himself in the flourishing 1970s NYC punk scene. He was known by musicians all over the city for his signature upbeat conducting tempo and DIY aesthetic, the broken piece of pool stick he used as a baton, the beat up barstool he turned into a music stand, and the wild, unkempt gray hair exploding out from the sides of his balding head. After bouncing from band to band, the middle-aged conductor crossed paths with the Ramones for the first time in 1974—and after seamlessly clicking with the group while filling in for their usual conductor during a legendary show at CBGB, he was officially asked to join the outfit. With the five original Ramones in place, the band was born, ready to set the world ablaze with hit after lightning-fast hit. With Milo shaping the sound of the ensemble with his back turned to the audience night after night, the Ramones exploded in popularity. Fans and critics alike attributed the band’s high-intensity stage performances to Milo’s relentless commitment to tempo-setting and innovative use of dynamics. And though the Ramones’ debut LP did not achieve success on the charts, it was widely recognized as one of the most well-conducted rock records of its time. But the band’s newfound success didn’t come without its problems. They might have looked the part onstage—four musicians excitedly blasting through sets as an elegantly postured Milo tapped on his music stand and waved his arms until his classically fitted tuxedo was drenched in sweat—but offstage, their relationships suffered. Over time, Joey Ramone grew tired of Milo showboating by cueing him into songs with a David Lee Roth-style karate kick just inches away from his face. Johnny Ramone took issue with the way Milo would strong-arm their sets with impossible directives like conducting him to play two guitars at once. During a London concert in 1984, the tension finally came to a head. Absolutely wasted and conducting the show with a half-empty bottle of Jack Daniels in lieu of the baton he’d already smashed on an amp, Milo tried conducting Tommy Ramone to stand up from his drummer’s seat so he could sit it in, and when the drummer refused, Milo stormed offstage. It would be the last time the five original Ramones were together, ending a remarkable creative stretch that the band would never match again. After leaving the Ramones, Milo returned to the NYC scene where he’d first gotten his break and conducted in bands throughout the city. Toward the end of his life and after decades of coldness toward his old bandmates, Milo finally offered a softer perspective on his legacy with the Ramones in his 2012 memoir, Code Of Conduct: Conducting The Punk Revolution, writing: “The Ramones were a collection of misfits. Four broke kids from Queens and a conductor nearly twice their age tying it all together. We weren’t best friends. We had our problems, and we came to blows more times than I could count. But there’s no other group of musicians that I would’ve wanted to conduct. Together, we made some incredible music.” So sad. Losing a total original like Milo Ramone is an absolute gut punch, but nevertheless, his legacy as one of punk’s great conductors will live on. So long, Milo. You will be missed."
Probably Awesome! The Kid Who Left High School To Go To Hockey School In Like Canada Or Vermont Seems To Be In Some Sort Of Pre-NHL League Now,N/A,https://clickhole.com/probably-awesome-the-kid-who-left-high-school-to-go-to-1834057077/,"While we don’t know enough about how the hockey world works to be 100% sure, here’s some news that seems like it’s pretty great: The kid who left high school to go to hockey school in, like, Canada or Vermont seems to be in some sort of pre-NHL league now. Cool! Good for him! As you’ll recall, about seven months ago, that kid Ethan Broder dropped out of 11th grade and moved somewhere north and cold like Ontario or Vermont or maybe New Hampshire to go to a school that seems to be like a boarding school specifically for kids who are really good at hockey and want to go pro. As it turns out, Ethan’s presumably been crushing it at hockey school, because he just changed his profile picture to a photo of him skating in a blue uniform with the caption “Proud to suit up for the Steelheads #MississaugaSteelheads,” indicating that he’s now moved on from hockey school to what appears to be some sort of minor league team. Judging from numerous comments on the photo like “hell yea man” and “next stop NHL dude” from other kids wearing hockey uniforms in the profile pictures, one gets the sense that this is a pretty big accomplishment, and some cursory googling suggests that the Steelheads are indeed a bigger deal than a normal high school hockey team. While Ethan’s still not yet good enough to have his own Wikipedia page, his name does show up on a couple of amateur scouting sites, meaning he’s at the very least at the point where strangers are interested in his development as a player. Neat! Though we’re still not entirely sure what all of this means, from where we’re standing it definitely seems like he’s on the right track to be a real hockey player. Way to go, Ethan, and good luck with the Steelheads! "
Major Continuity Error: HBO Is Apologizing In Advance For A Scene In The ‘Game Of Thrones’ Finale Where Jon Snow’s Cell Phone Goes Off And His Ringtone Is A 16-Bit Version Of The Show’s Theme Song,N/A,https://clickhole.com/major-continuity-error-hbo-is-apologizing-in-advance-f-1834840018/,"The people who make Game of Thrones are human like everyone else and that means a mistake from time to time, but this one is likely to go down in entertainment history as one of the worst. HBO is apologizing in advance for a scene in the Game of Thrones finale where Jon Snow’s cell phone goes off and his ringtone is a 16-bit version of the show’s theme song. Yikes. This is a colossal fuck-up. According to producer David Benioff, the moment happens during a scene in which Kit Harington, who plays Jon Snow, has just been poisoned by a power mad Daenarys. Clutching at his throat, Jon Snow stumbles his way to the doors of his bedchamber as Daenarys cooly moves to block his escape, a cruel smile beginning to play across her lips, when suddenly the translucent fabric of Jon Snow’s cloak lights up with the rectangular blue hue of a phone screen while the show’s minor key melody begins tinkling out full blast in all its 16-bit glory. Eventually the phone goes silent as Jon Snow finally succumbs to the poison at Daenrys’s feet, but Benioff warns that it will be impossible not to notice its reappearance moments later when Daenarys leans down to kiss a dead John Snow on the forehead and his breast lights up with a buzzing sound as whoever called him leaves a message. Oof. C’mon HBO, you can do better than that. Each episode from the show’s final season reportedly cost $15 million to make, so the fact that Kit Harington’s MIDI-blaring cell phone was able to invade Westeros begs the question: How did this happen? “We are usually so diligent about continuity,” Dan Weiss, showrunner and co-director of the final episode, said in a prepared statement. “The shoot was very hard and demanding and it’s likely that after a very tiring shoot, Kit’s iPhone playing a videogame version of Ramin [Djawadi]’s iconic theme music during his death scene was simply overlooked by an exhausted crew.” Yeesh. The last season of Game of Thrones has proven to be a pretty polarizing one, but everyone can agree that a phone repeating a digital rendition of the show’s own theme music is a sure-fire way to ruin a scene, if not a whole episode. We’ll see how it plays out, but even with the heads-up, it’s doubtful audiences will be forgiving."
"Well-Deserved Break: After All His Hard Work, Robert Mueller Is Relaxing By Writing A Report About Himself",N/A,https://clickhole.com/well-deserved-break-after-all-his-hard-work-robert-mu-1834392114/,"After spending a long two years conducting an investigation into Russia’s efforts to sway the 2016 election in favor of Donald Trump, Robert Mueller is finally enjoying a well-deserved break. With his exhaustive 448-page report on Russian interference behind him, the special counsel is now relaxing by writing a report about himself. What a nice treat! He has definitely earned some me time. Although Mueller’s leisurely fact-finding mission about himself is still ongoing, he’s already turned in his initial conclusions to Congress in a 200-page document titled “Preliminary Report On The Investigation Into Robert Mueller.” According his findings, Robert Swan Mueller III is a Caucasian male born in 1944 who has spent the majority of his career holding various positions within the federal government. The report states that “by interviewing my past colleagues, I have determined with high certainty that I fought in the Vietnam War and earned a Bronze Star and a Purple Heart. Subsequently, university records confirm that I attended the University of Virginia School of Law and engaged in a conspiracy with professors to graduate with a law degree.” In another major revelation, Mueller also accuses himself of willfully obstructing criminals by working as a U.S. attorney. Fun! Sounds like Mueller’s having a good time. While Mueller’s report into himself is impressive in its scope, at this stage, it still falls short of establishing certain key conclusions. For instance, after subpoenaing his wife and kids and conducting over 300 hours of interviews with them, Mueller found it was highly likely that he loves them very much but could not produce enough material evidence to prove it beyond a reasonable doubt. Accordingly, Mueller states that “due to a lack of verifiable, empirical proof, this report neither suggests nor refutes that I love my family very much.” However, legal experts say that his argument is worded in such a way that all but confirms he does indeed love his family very much, but he leaves it up to the reader to make this conclusion and act accordingly. After an incredibly stressful couple of years, it’s great to see Mueller using his skills as a prosecutor to indulge in a little self-care. Unfortunately, the public will likely never learn many crucial details from his report, such as what his favorite movies are or what kind of music he listens to, since most of the section on Mueller’s hobbies and personal interests has been redacted by Attorney General William Barr. Despite those omissions, this report paints an irrefutable picture of Robert Mueller as a man who is taking a long overdue siesta. Enjoy it, sir! You’ve certainly earned it. "
Urgent Health Warning: The Surgeon General Has Issued A Reminder To Parents That No Amount Of Vegetables Can Stop Their Children’s Heads From Rocketing Off Their Bodies And Into The Sky,N/A,https://clickhole.com/urgent-health-warning-the-surgeon-general-has-issued-a-1834342517/,"If you are a parent with a young child, you absolutely need to stop what you’re doing and read this immediately: The Surgeon General has issued an urgent health warning telling parents that no amount of vegetables can stop their children’s heads from rocketing off their bodies and into the sky. Chilling. Parents definitely need to take this warning very seriously. In a statement released earlier this morning, U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams released a grim statement detailing the the futility of a healthy diet in preventing the very real possibility of children’s heads spontaneously ejecting from their necks and torpedoing off into the unknown, leaving their headless bodies twitching and flopping on the floor like just-caught sea bass:  “While it is important to make sure your child eats plenty of vegetables, the nutrients and dietary benefits they provide will in no way prevent your child’s head from arbitrarily blasting off of their shoulders and careening out of sight over the horizon,” said Surgeon General Jerome Adams in a statement released this morning. “You can feed your son or daughter 30 pounds of broccoli a day, you can feed them a metric ton of broccoli, but not even the healthiest diet in the world can keep your kid’s head attached to them. Sometimes, regardless of whether or not they eat all their Brussels sprouts, children’s heads just whoosh away into outer space.”  In order to spread awareness about this alarming reality, the Surgeon General’s office has begun airing a PSA on major television networks that starts off with a seemingly peaceful scene of a woman spoon-feeding peas to her 9-year-old son. The woman’s husband says, “Honey, do you ever worry our son’s head is going to just straight-up blast off his neck and hurtle into a black hole millions of light years away from here?” The woman says, “No, that won’t happen because I am feeding him vegetables, which are healthy.” The child then says, “Guess again, idiots,” and his head shoots directly off of his body, crashing through the ceiling and leaving a huge hole. A narrator says, “When it comes to your child’s head flying away, vegetables don’t matter.” The woman then turns to her husband, points to the hole in their ceiling, and screams, “Get your power tools and fix that FUCKING hole!” Wow. That is some powerful and effective messaging. While vegetables are definitely important for growing children, it’s crucial for parents to remember that carrots and spinach can’t solve every problem, and even if your kids eat a balanced diet, you may wake up one day to find your son or daughter’s headless body jiggling around in a chair as their head screams past Saturn and the mighty gas giant Jupiter. Kudos to the Surgeon General for getting this much-needed information out to the masses!"
Heartwarming: The Yakuza And The Harlem Globetrotters Set Aside Their Differences To Film A PSA Against Texting While Driving,N/A,https://clickhole.com/heartwarming-the-yakuza-and-the-harlem-globetrotters-s-1834342242/,"In a world filled with hatred and fighting, this beautiful story will remind you that even the fiercest of enemies can sometimes come together for an important cause: The Yakuza and the Harlem Globetrotters have set aside their differences to create a PSA against texting while driving. Bravo, Yakuza and Harlem Globetrotters! It must have been hard to cooperate with your sworn foes, but automobile safety is a serious issue that’s worth the cost. The Yakuza and the Globetrotters have been bitter enemies ever since the fateful day decades ago when one of the Globetrotters insulted the honor of a Yakuza boss by shooting a nothing-but-net three-pointer over his head. After that initial clash, any Harlem Globetrotter who so much as showed his face in a Yakuza tattoo parlor in Tokyo would immediately get chopped apart by katanas. And if a Yakuza enforcer strayed onto the Globetrotters’ basketball court, the Globetrotters would start dunking over him and dribbling basketballs through the his legs while “Sweet Georgia Brown” played on the loudspeaker. That’s what makes it so inspiring that the two groups were able to stand together, side by side, to remind drivers how important it is that they keep their eyes on the road.  In the moving PSA, the two rival groups walk toward each other from opposite ends of the screen. The Yakuza aim their knives and guns at the Globetrotters, and the Globetrotters start spinning basketballs on their fingers. It seems like the usual Yakuza vs. Globetrotter violence and basketball tricks are about to break out—but suddenly, both groups drop their weapons and basketballs, turn to the camera, and link hands in a powerful symbol of cooperation. Text appears on the screen reading, “Whether you are a member of a Japanese crime syndicate or you perform dazzling basketball stunts in the USA, everyone can agree that texting while driving can lead to a deadly accident.” The ad then cuts to shot of a car crash where a dead driver is sprawled on the steering wheel. In the driver’s hand, a shattered cell phone still displays a group text in which the Yakuza have texted the victim, “Don’t look at your phone while driving” and the Harlem Globetrotters have replied, “Your life is more important than a text message.”  Wow. What a powerful ad! Sources say that the Yakuza and the Harlem Globetrotters have sadly gone back to being enemies since filming the PSA, but it’s wonderful that for a brief moment, they were able to come together to do something good for the world. Their willingness to cooperate on this meaningful project may just save some lives."
A Concert To Remember: Kacey Musgraves Invited Cap’n Crunch To Sing With Her On Stage Last Night Just As A Ruse To Dump Pig Blood On Him And Make The Crowd Laugh,N/A,https://clickhole.com/a-concert-to-remember-kacey-musgraves-invited-cap-n-cr-1833439162/,"Kacey Musgraves has established herself as one of the most amazing performers working today, and last night at a concert in Knoxville, TN, she wowed thousands of fans with a show they’ll remember forever: The country artist invited Cap’n Crunch to sing with her on stage just as a ruse to dump pig blood on him and make the crowd laugh. Wow! We are literally SO jealous of everyone who got to see this happen live! Halfway through her sold-out concert yesterday evening, Musgraves announced to her fans that she would like to invite a “very special friend” to join her for her hit ballad “Rainbows” before having a security guard lift Cap’n Crunch’s two-and-a-half-foot-tall, kettlebell-shaped body onto the stage. Crunch, who was wearing his nicest hat and shoes for the special occasion, waved to the audience and beamed with joy as Musgraves led him across the stage to a microphone positioned directly underneath an oil drum of pig entrails hanging in the rafters. As the ballad’s soft piano intro unfolded, Cap’n Crunch took a deep breath and then sang out in a warbly, entirely off-key voice, “When it rains, it pours—”, before he was suddenly cut off by 55 gallons of hog viscera raining down on him and the crowd’s uproarious laughter that followed. If that wasn’t already incredible enough, Musgraves then led the thousands of audience members in a spirited chant of “CAP’N SLUT! CAP’N SLUT!” while the Cap’n’s two-dimensional eyes began to fill with tears. Humiliated, the Cap’n scurried off the stage, ran out of the venue, quickly stopped to pee on a dumpster like a dog, and disappeared off into the night hysterically crying while Musgraves resumed playing a selection of songs from her Grammy-winning album Golden Hour. Cap’n Crunch has not been seen since. Of course, a performance like this didn’t come without a ton of preparation. Earlier last month, Musgraves called Cap’n Crunch on the phone and said that she was “a big fan of his” and would be “honored” if he sang with her onstage an at upcoming concert, all while she and her bandmates tried to stifle their laughter. Cap’n Crunch, completely starstruck, took several deep breaths before responding, “Nothing would make me happier,” adding that her music literally saved his life when he was at a real low point, to which Musgraves rolled her eyes on the other end of the line and whispered, “He’s actually buying it!” to her bandmates. As soon as the call ended, Cap’n Crunch, who lives in Somalia, took out a high-interest loan to pay for a $1,400 plane ticket to Tennessee, quit his job as a prostitute, and headed to America to get ready for the big day. In the ensuing weeks, the Cap’n went to great lengths to prepare for his duet with Musgraves. From practicing his singing for hours a day to taking diet pills in hopes of losing weight so he could look his best for the crowd, the Cap’n did everything in his power to ensure the duet went perfectly. “Mom, if you can hear me up in Heaven, just know that I’m singing a big duet with Kacey Musgraves tomorrow, and I hope you’ll be watching from up above,” the Cap’n prayed the night before his performance in the Motel 6 where he was temporarily living. “I’ll do my absolute best to make you proud.” Of course, he didn’t end up making his mother proud, but instead went on to utterly disgrace himself before thousands of jeering people thanks to Musgraves and her brilliant pig blood prank. LOL!!! Kudos to Musgraves for putting Cap’n Crunch in his place. Here’s hoping that small, sweaty moron is too embarrassed to show his face in public ever again!"
Death With Dignity: Temple Grandin Has Developed A New Mechanical Restraint System For Humanely Slaughtering Cap’n Crunch,N/A,https://clickhole.com/death-with-dignity-temple-grandin-has-developed-a-new-1834015065/,"Temple Grandin has long been fighting for a world where no living being has to suffer unduly for another’s benefit, and at 71 years old, it seems she’s still as committed to the cause as ever: The famed scientist just announced that she has developed a new mechanical restraint system for humanely slaughtering Cap’n Crunch. Amazing! Dr. Grandin, a leading pioneer in the field of animal behavior and an activist for ethical slaughter, revealed in a statement earlier this week that her new system will make it possible to kill Cap’n Crunch and harvest his succulent meat in a humane and dignified manner. The system consists of an anti-anxiety harness built to snugly secure Cap’n Crunch’s round, two-and-a-half-foot-tall body as he is led up a ramp into a tunnel lined with soothing photos of his home on Crunch Island, thereby calming him down so he doesn’t become violent or spray out a torrent of stress diarrhea. Once in the tunnel, Cap’n Crunch will follow a trail of Crunch Berries, lapping them up excitedly with his disproportionately long tongue, until he reaches a platform where his captain’s hat will be gently removed, at which point he will be rendered unconscious with a bolt pistol before being dropped through a large industrial paper shredder. Now that’s how you kill Cap’n Crunch humanely! “Cap’n Crunch’s all-cereal diet gives him extra tender and delicious meat, but if he’s frightened at the time of slaughter, his body will release chemicals that render his meat tough and flavorless, which is why a peaceful death is so crucial,” Grandin explained. “After spending months following Cap’n Crunch around as he sails the high seas and screams at young children about breakfast, I believe I understand his psychology enough to know that the method of slaughter I’ve devised will leave him placid and undisturbed in his final moments.” Awesome! Kudos to Dr. Grandin for all the incredible work she’s done to promote ethical, humane animal slaughter. While Cap’n Crunch is a despicable shit-goblin who in all honesty deserves a brutal and prolonged death, it’s nonetheless very kind of Grandin to go out of her way to ensure that he leaves this world with minimal suffering."
The Fairy Tale Ends: Cap’n Crunch And Maxine Waters Have Filed For Divorce After 27 Years Of Marriage,N/A,https://clickhole.com/the-fairy-tale-ends-cap-n-crunch-and-maxine-waters-hav-1833409485/,"Though celebrity marriages come and go, there are those rare few that seem built to stand the test of time—the ones where the couples are so adorably head-over-heels for one another that it gives you hope in the power of true love. Sadly, one of those seemingly perfect celebrity unions has now come to an end: Cap’n Crunch and U.S. congresswoman Maxine Waters have officially filed for divorce after 27 years of marriage. This is so heartbreaking. The two of them seemed so happy together. For nearly three decades, Crunch and Rep. Waters have been one of America’s most beloved celebrity couples, living out a fairy tale romance on red carpets and in tabloids. The pair first met at a Weight Watchers meeting in 1989, but absolutely hated each other, and only started dating after they discovered they shared a mutual dislike for little kids who fly kites in public parks. Over the course of 30 consecutive dates to the dog pound, the two gradually became enamored with one another, and it wasn’t long before they fell deeply in love. Their relationship took off just as Waters’ political star was starting to rise, and soon the glamorous duo became darlings of the national media, with Time famously declaring them “America’s Loudest, Most Sexually Adventurous Couple” in a 1990 cover story. Maxine Waters and Cap’n Crunch’s 1992 wedding was a star-studded, internationally televised affair, attended by A-listers such as Eddie Murphy, Beetlejuice, and Mia Farrow, and was officiated by Nelson Mandela. In the decades that followed, their storybook love became an object of public obsession, with celebrity gossip rags breathlessly documenting their every move, whether they were furiously dry-humping at the Jumanji premiere, furiously dry-humping at the ’02 Winter Olympics torch lighting, or furiously dry-humping at Barack Obama’s swearing-in ceremony. In a relationship that featured no known scandals or extramarital affairs, Crunch and Waters were often looked to as a shining example of a strong, healthy marriage, making the sudden announcement of their divorce all the more shocking. In a statement released through his publicist, Crunch opened up about the split: “After 27 years, I have decided that I must divorce my old wife, and the reason for that is that yesterday she said, ‘I’m going to pinch you, Cap’n Crunch,’ and chased me up and down the stairs for three hours, scaring me greatly. I no longer feel safe in the same house with her, so now I am divorcing her.” However, in a statement of her own, Waters offered a seemingly different explanation for the breakup: “I divorced Cap’n Crunch because he looks weird. I think he might be a Muppet or something.” Whatever the true reason for the divorce, it’s nonetheless sad to see a union that for years was vaunted as a model of marital stability come to such an abrupt conclusion. This is undoubtedly a difficult time for Cap’n Crunch and Maxine Waters, but both have made it clear that they’re looking forward to the next chapter in their lives, with Crunch indicating that he’s going to become a missionary in China, while Waters says, “I am going to sit in my La-Z-Boy and read a Where’s Waldo? book until I pass away.” While it’s heartbreaking to see them split, we wish both Crunch and Waters the best of luck in whatever their futures hold."
A Crisis Of Faith: Pope Francis Has Left The Catholic Church To Worship A Monster Truck He Saw Flatten 30 School Busses,N/A,https://clickhole.com/a-crisis-of-faith-pope-francis-has-left-the-catholic-c-1834248129/,"Today marks an abrupt end to the six-year reign of perhaps the most beloved and popular Pope of the modern era. On the steps of the Vatican this morning, Pope Francis announced that he is leaving the Catholic church to worship a monster truck he saw flatten 30 school busses. This is a sad day for believers and nonbelievers alike. Pope Francis was a revolutionary leader for the Catholic Church whose spiritual guidance will be missed. In an official statement presented to cardinals at the Vatican, Pope Francis explained this morning that after seeing Gravedigger crush a row of school buses at last night’s Monster Jam event, he was overcome with a newfound reverence and awe for the monster truck’s power and realized that he needed to dedicate his life to serving the massive vehicle and supplicating himself before its unrivaled glory. Citing the monster truck’s incredibly loud engine, green flame paint job, and massive tires, Pope Francis spoke of his conviction that Gravedigger is more powerful than Jesus Christ and that he has renounced Catholicism to worship it. “After a late night of scripture study and prayer, I have not been able to find a single one of Jesus’ miracles that matches the transcendent power and majesty of Gravedigger smashing an entire row of school buses as if they were tiny tin cans,” Francis explained to cardinals in attendance. “As I sat and contemplated the splendor of such a giant truck reducing full-sized buses to rubble in just 10 minutes, a profound humility washed over me. I realized that in all of Christ’s ministry, he never smashed school buses to bits under his gigantic tires. I knew in that moment that Gravedigger alone was worthy of my prayers.” The now former Pope then went on to explain that he will continue his life of humble religious practice, but that Gravedigger will now be the subject of his spiritual devotion. “I will now attend Monster Jam each week to renew my dedication to the monster truck,” Francis said. “And this summer, I will make a pilgrimage to Digger’s Dungeon in North Carolina alongside a congregation of others who have been moved by Gravedigger pure bus-demolishing power to pay my respects.” Wow. This is certainly a day of great change for the former Pope and the Catholic Church, which once again finds itself in transition as the College of Cardinals convenes at the Vatican to find his replacement. We wish the best to Pope Francis as he begins his new life of religious devotion to the monster truck that has won dominion over his soul. "
"Compelling Message: Bernie Sanders Has Asked Voters To Consider That, Adjusted For Age, He Is More Sexually Attractive Than Beto O’Rourke",N/A,https://clickhole.com/compelling-message-bernie-sanders-has-asked-voters-to-1834341702/,"Beto O’Rourke has made a big splash in the race for the 2020 Democratic nomination, garnering droves of supporters with what many consider an undeniable sex appeal. But opponent Bernie Sanders isn’t allowing Beto’s good looks hurt him in the polls without a fight: Sanders has asked voters to consider that, adjusted for age, he is more sexually attractive than Beto O’Rourke. Wow. This is quite a compelling point from the ever-persuasive Sanders! Sanders first made the claim at a rally in Houston this week, where he addressed his audience standing next to a life-sized photo of Beto O’Rourke. “I understand that many of you consider Beto an incredibly attractive man, but please know that I am much sexier for 77 than he is for 46,” Sanders explained. “My message to you is this: It is very easy to be attractive at age 46. All Beto really has going for him is that he is relatively tall and has a nice smile. By contrast, I am one of the most physically attractive elderly men alive. Most people my age are just piles of bones and liver spots, but instead I am spry and have almost three-quarters of a full head of hair. I strongly believe that, all other things being equal, I am about 10 times hotter than Mr. O’Rourke.” You can’t put it much more plainly than that. Chalk this one up as a major win for the Sanders campaign! Bernie then went on to show the cheering crowd an age-progressed photo of Beto in his late 70s in which the politician appeared bald and toothless and had been hooked up to an oxygen tank. “As you can see, when Beto is my age, he will be completely hideous, whereas I remain one of the most fuckable septuagenarians in the United States!” Bernie yelled to thunderous applause. I am hotter for my age group than any other candidate in the Democratic primary, and I will bring my undeniable sex appeal to the White House in 2020!” Wow. You may not agree with all of Bernie’s views, but you can’t deny that he has a point here. As the Democratic race heats up, it’ll be interesting to see if Sanders’s compelling argument about how hot he is can turn some Beto supporters into Bernie-heads."
National Security Crisis: The White House Is In Panic Mode After President Trump Tweeted ‘Karate Dave Is Coming To Kill Me’,N/A,https://clickhole.com/national-security-crisis-the-white-house-is-in-panic-m-1834176840/,"A crisis is unfolding in Washington, D.C. that has the entire nation captivated. The White House is currently in a panic after President Donald Trump tweeted, “Karate Dave is coming to kill me.” Terrifying. Political views aside, this is a national security crisis. The White House has been on high alert ever since early this morning when Trump posted the alarming tweet: Within moments of the tweet going live, emergency lockdown protocols were enacted in the Oval Office, and ever since, the Secret Service has been forbidding anybody to enter or leave White House as they scramble to verify the threat and ensure the president’s safety. Dozens of soldiers are patrolling the halls of the White House and Pentagon right now with orders from Vice President Mike Pence to shoot Karate Dave on sight. Unfortunately, since President Trump refuses to elaborate on who Karate Dave is or what he looks like, the soldiers are not exactly sure what they’re supposed to be protecting the president from. Additionally, Marine helicopters are currently hovering above the White House scanning the surrounding vicinity for anybody who might be the “Karate Dave” mentioned in Trump’s tweet. “President Trump has now been ushered into a secure location, and we are keeping him under heightened security so that the figure known as ‘Karate Dave’ cannot harm him,” U.S. Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters at a press conference held shortly after Trump’s tweet. “The President is now completely safe from Karate Dave.” Worryingly, less than one minute after Sanders issued this statement to the press, President Trump posted the following tweet: Shortly thereafter, the White House reported that a man wearing a karate uniform punched a hole through the Oval Office wall and screamed, “Donald Trump! Show yourself, you scaly old geezer! It’s time for you to face my merciless karate!” The intruder was immediately shot dozens of times by Secret Service agents, who then announced the threat to the president’s safety had been eliminated. However, immediately after this incident, President Trump issued the following tweet: This is definitely a scary time for our nation. White House officials say they are still on the lookout for anybody that could be Karate Dave. Trump’s political ally, Senator Mitch McConnell, has been sent to personally beg the president to explain to him who Karate Dave is. Yet Trump merely replied to McConnell’s queries by saying, “He’s the karate man coming to kill me. He is big and small.” This is a seriously disturbing situation, and military and law enforcement officials will be on high alert until it’s resolved. Hopefully, the White House can neutralize the threat of Karate Dave and get the president back to serving the American people as soon as possible!"
Fed Up: SeaWorld Just Went Off About How Everyone Wants SeaWorld To Get Rid Of Orcas But No One’s Coming To Take The Orcas Off Their Hands,N/A,https://clickhole.com/fed-up-seaworld-just-went-off-about-how-everyone-wants-1834156708/,"After years of being demonized by animal rights groups for holding killer whales in captivity, it looks like SeaWorld is finally getting fed up with its critics: The theme park just went off on Twitter about how everyone wants them to get rid of orcas but no one’s coming to take the orcas off their hands. Damn, seems like they’ve got a serious bone to pick! SeaWorld went on the offensive in an irate Twitter thread earlier today, calling out everyone who blasts them for keeping orcas in captivity but don’t actually offer any solutions.  Wow. Clearly, SeaWorld is all out of patience and is not gonna let anyone else accuse them of animal abuse if they’re not going to help fix the problem. For the orcas’ sake, let’s hope SeaWorld and their critics figure out a solution soon."
Gotta Pay The Bills: PBS Just Got Really Desperate During A Pledge Drive And Offered Up One Night Of Passion With Thomas The Tank Engine,N/A,https://clickhole.com/gotta-pay-the-bills-pbs-just-got-really-desperate-duri-1834079359/,"With the Trump administration aiming to slash public broadcasting from the federal budget, funding for PBS and its member stations is facing a dire threat, and they’re very clearly feeling the heat: PBS just got really desperate during a pledge drive and offered up one night of passion with Thomas the Tank Engine to viewers. This is really hard to watch. Guess they have to pay the bills somehow. Last night, near the end of a live pledge drive broadcast in which they were still thousands of dollars short of their funding goal, PBS made a last-ditch appeal to potential donors by offering a $500 premium gift package that included a sensual night alone in a romantic private suite with Thomas the Tank Engine, with the promise that the anthropomorphic locomotive would serve viewers’ “each and every desire.” The gift package, which also included a PBS tote bag, steel travel mug, and Joni 75: A Birthday Celebration concert DVD, would allow donors free rein to live out their wildest fantasies with Thomas who, PBS noted, can perform some truly exotic and stimulating sex acts due to being a train.  “It’s donations like yours that allow us to keep quality programming on the air, and by pledging $500, not only will you get a night of debauchery to do anything—and we mean anything—you want with Thomas, you’ll also receive the satisfaction of helping public television remain free and independent for viewers everywhere,” said pledge drive host and PBS personality Rick Steves, adding that Thomas has 5,000 times as many nerve endings per square inch as humans and is unfathomably sensitive to erotic touch. “If you enjoy popular PBS shows like Antiques Roadshow and Masterpiece Theatre, then we’d strongly encourage you to support our mission with a financial gift that’ll win you the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to have your way with beautiful Thomas, who’s ready to toot his steam whistle in ecstasy as you sensually explore his valve gears all night long.” Phones rang off the hook in the background as Steves continued describing the gift package, with hundreds of viewers apparently eager for the chance to make love again and again to Thomas while gazing into his round, smiling face. Interest seemed to spike even more after Steves noted that, for an additional charge of just $100, viewers with exhibitionist proclivities could arrange for Thomas’s co-star grouchy ol’ Gordon to be present as a voyeuristic observer, where he’d grumble nonstop about all the work that needs to be done at the rail yard while you breathlessly defile his chum Thomas in countless filthy ways. And if the deal couldn’t get any sweeter, Steves revealed that a portion of all financial contributions would go to help out a local NPR sister station, and viewers could take satisfaction knowing that they’re supporting vital public radio programming as they make feral, sweaty love to the friendly train. Wow! All aboard to save public television! With their funding at greater risk than ever before, it’s clear that PBS is willing to do whatever it takes to make ends meet and keep their mission alive. Here’s hoping that offering up Thomas as a passive vessel for viewers’ most depraved sexual fantasies pays off and PBS is able to continue producing quality television for years to come. "
"Bold Stance: Secret Has Announced That No Matter How Far The Body-Positivity Movement Goes, They’ll Never Pretend Like A Woman Smelling Bad Is Anything But Disgusting",N/A,https://clickhole.com/bold-stance-secret-has-announced-that-no-matter-how-fa-1834171641/,"Many companies choose to play it safe with their marketing to avoid offending potential customers, but one deodorant brand just took a seriously bold stance: Secret has announced that no matter how far the body-positivity movement goes, they’ll never pretend like a woman smelling bad is anything but disgusting. Damn. Sounds like Secret isn’t messing around. “The body positivity movement has inspired people to practice self-love and acceptance, and that’s something we at Secret absolutely believe in, but if the movement ever starts to encourage women to embrace their body odor, we will absolutely not be down with that,” said the deodorant company in a statement earlier today. “We fully support women as they choose whether or not to wear makeup or shave their body hair, but our support will never extend to the decision to go without deodorant. There is zero empowerment to be found in your natural body odor. The bottom line is that you should be ashamed to smell bad, and you need to spend money on Secret deodorant to smell good.” Secret doubled down on their stance by posting a video to Instagram in which a woman applies Secret to her armpits, turns to the camera, and says, “I’m beautiful inside and out, but it’d be fucking gross if I smelled horrible. I’m going to use Secret every day until I die, and whenever I encounter a woman who doesn’t wear deodorant, I will think less of her due to her foul stench.” The brand included a caption below the video that read, “The only excuse a woman has to smell bad is if she’s homeless. Period. Wear deodorant, goddammit.” Wow! Seems like Secret’s really going out on a limb here, but it’s clearly something they feel strongly about. Time will tell if they stand by their belief that women smelling bad is revolting. "
Major Blunder: Jimmy Carter Just Accidentally Built An ESPN Zone Instead Of A Habitat For Humanity House And Everyone Had To Act Like That Was The Plan All Along,N/A,https://clickhole.com/major-blunder-jimmy-carter-just-accidentally-built-an-1833908051/,"A well-known charity has been forced to double down in the face of a major screw-up committed by the most famous representative of their organization: Jimmy Carter just accidentally built an ESPN Zone instead of a Habitat for Humanity house and everyone had to act like that was the plan all along. Yikes. Carter clearly meant well, but this is a train wreck by any measure. Habitat for Humanity organizers received quite a shock earlier this week when they found that the building former President Carter had completed as part of their relief effort for flooding victims in rural Georgia was actually a 35,000-square-foot ESPN-branded restaurant and entertainment center instead of the modest three-bedroom home they had been expecting. Rather than call Carter on his mistake, however, Habitat has so far aimed to spare the 94-year-old’s feelings by pretending that the fully equipped bar and grill area and the enormous array of 100 televisions playing sports at ear-splitting volumes are exactly what they had intended for him to build and were in no way incorrect. Upon seeing Carter beaming with pride at the cutting-edge virtual golf setup he’d assembled all on his own in the restaurant’s sprawling arcade area, Habitat staffers just didn’t have the heart to tell him that it wasn’t what they actually wanted, so now everyone’s just rolling with it as if this sports memorabilia-covered theme restaurant is the same as any of their other houses. With Carter having already spent over 60 times the original budget for the home on expensive touches like hardwood flooring modeled after an NBA court and game-worn autographed jerseys from Hall of Famers across the four major sports, Habitat couldn’t afford to rebuild the dwelling and have had no choice but to move a family displaced by flooding into the ESPN Zone despite its complete lack of bedrooms or shower facilities. The children were pretty excited that their new home came with its own air hockey table and Big Buck Hunter Pro cabinet, but the parents burst into tears upon learning that the only real place to sleep in the building Carter had made for them was atop the replica SportsCenter desk that serves as a hostess station. This family faces a real uphill battle settling into a home where the constant din of pop-a-shot basketball games and demo-screen race noises from NAMCO motocross simulators is only out-decibeled by the Monday Night Football theme blaring 24/7 from the central JumboTron with no obvious way to turn off. It’s understandable that Habitat wouldn’t want Carter to get discouraged about the otherwise stellar work he’s done for them over the years, but moving a family into what is clearly a restaurant geared towards diehard sports fans is definitely not their finest moment. It’s unfortunate to see such a good-hearted man get it wrong like this, and you’ve gotta feel for the family that has to live with the consequences of his mistakes. Here’s hoping Carter can get his form back and keep building homes for needy Americans across the country."
Perils Of Socialism: Sweden Used To Be A Prosperous Nation. Then They Became Socialist. Today Their Country Is Known As Venezuela,N/A,https://clickhole.com/perils-of-socialism-sweden-used-to-be-a-prosperous-nat-1833845631/,"Liberal idiots are flocking to the siren call of socialism, convinced that they’re special snowflakes who deserve everything for free. Sure, free healthcare sounds nice, but countries that try socialism always pay the price. Just look at the sad example of once-prosperous Sweden, which ruined itself with socialism and today is called Venezuela. What a tragedy! Sweden was once the jewel of Scandinavia, but it’s now an economically ravaged South American hellhole.  Just a few years ago, you could walk down the streets of capitalist Stockholm and see flourishing businesses on every street corner. The Swedish dream was alive and well because people worked hard for their success, holding jobs like manufacturing cars for Volvo or singing in the band ABBA. Then disaster struck when socialist politicians started promising pipe dreams like free education and parental leave for new moms and dads, and next thing you know, Sweden has become a country called Venezuela and their national currency, the bolivar, is worthless thanks to inflation.  Thanks to the failed socialist government in Sweden, things are now so bad in Venezuela that people who live in the Swedish city of Caracas, Venezuela can’t even buy lingonberry sauce at the now-empty supermarkets. Instead of feasting on kanelbulle cinnamon buns like they used to, Swedes are now starving without the basic ingredients to cook arepas. And rather than admire the beautiful Northern Lights that once lit up the night sky above Jukkasjärvi, Venezuelan cities now suffer from constant electrical blackouts. Ask anyone in Venezuela and they’ll tell you they yearn for the days when their country was called Sweden and they were all rich because of capitalism, but those days are gone forever, and Venezuela will never be located in Scandinavia ever again. This horror story should serve as a warning about the evils of big government, but idiot liberals want to follow in Sweden’s footsteps and ruin our country with a doomed leftist agenda. Let’s hope Americans are smart enough to reject the lure of socialism and tell the radical left to take a hike back to Malmö, Venezuela."
Body-Positive Marketing: Dove’s New Freak Show Wagon Of ‘Nature’s Most Curious Mistakes And Human Horrors’ Is Traveling Across America To Show That Beauty Comes In All Shapes And Sizes,N/A,https://clickhole.com/body-positive-marketing-dove-s-new-freak-show-wagon-of-1833820896/,"If you’re tired of beauty brands promoting the same unrealistic “conventionally attractive” body types as always, you are going to absolutely love this bold new campaign from a company whose marketing team truly gets it: Dove’s new freak show wagon, “Nature’s Most Curious Mistakes And Human Horrors,” is traveling across America to show people that beauty comes in all shapes and sizes. We are so here for this! What a powerful way to start a national conversation about our culture’s unrealistic beauty standards. The traveling exhibition debuted in New York City, where Dove’s colorfully painted medicine wagon was pulled into the middle of Times Square by horses and a top-hatted, cane-swinging carnival barker invited bystanders “with stomachs as strong as they are inclusive” to “step right up and witness a series of inexplicable living oddities that prove all bodies are radiantly beautiful, no matter the confounding nausea they inspire in onlookers!”  Curtains covering the wagon’s iron-barred, escape-proof windows were then drawn back to reveal numerous human anomalies all donning simple white underwear adorned with Dove’s logo, including conjoined triplet sisters, a feral pug-nosed boy with hoof-shaped hands who went by the name “The Human Warthog,” and dozens of other shocking specimens that the amazing people at Dove have labeled “gorgeous freaks.” After handing out free beauty samples for viewers to hurl at the human exhibits and vomit bags labeled “Dove’s Freaks Who Made Me Sick Are Gorgeous On The Inside And Out” for nauseated passersby, Dove’s wagon then packed up and continued its westward journey across the country, with it’s final stop planned for San Francisco. Just yes! Even if you don’t use Dove products, you’ve got to admit that this is a brave, thoughtful step forward for the body positivity movement. “Behold Dove’s wagon of human grotesqueries, each one an affront to God’s design and stunningly perfect just the way they are!” announced Dove in a press release for the campaign that was accompanied by a photo of a razor-toothed man covered head-to-toe in thick hair like a werewolf lathering himself with Dove shampoo. “No illusions! No trickery! No photoshopping of malformations into the unattainably thin physiques that our culture would have you believe is the ideal body! These are REAL deformed beasts who are owning every last one of their nightmare-inducing flaws and proving that even the most gruesome and hideous freaks of nature, gathered from the most exotic and far-off lands, are sexy and deserve to love themselves in the skin they’re in!” Simply amazing. This campaign is bound to make a huge impact on people who think they need to look like a supermodel to be attractive! Our hats are off to Dove on this one. It’s awesome to see a beauty brand using its platform for good. Other companies had better take note, because Dove’s body-positive wagon, “Nature’s Most Curious Mistakes And Human Horrors,” has officially raised the bar for forward-thinking marketing!"

This sounds like an amazing opportunity! If you have any leads about who thought up Fig Newtons, now’s the time to call in and let the people at Nabisco know! “We recently realized we had no clue who first had the idea for us to start producing a thick, rectangular, fig-filled cookie covered in some kind of dense crust-type stuff. With the public’s help, we’d really like to get to the bottom of this,” announced the snack food giant in a statement from Dirk Van de Put, CEO of Nabisco’s parent company Mondelez. “Our first thought was that it must’ve been someone named Newton, because otherwise what the fuck is a ‘Newton,’ but it seems that we don’t have any Newtons on payroll. If someone came to us with the idea for Fig Newtons today, we honestly probably wouldn’t give it the green light because on paper the concept of that cookie sounds completely unappetizing and absolutely unhinged, but apparently we did that at some point, and we hope a $25,000 reward will be enough to incentivize someone with information on the situation to come forward.” Looks like Nabisco is really in the weeds on this one, so if you came up with Fig Newtons or know the person who did, this could be your chance to help them out and get compensated in the process. You could be the person who helps Nabisco figure out just who the hell dreamed up their famous flat fig cookies. Don’t wait—if you know something, write in today!"
Absolutely Infuriating: George R.R. Martin Wasted Time Eating Dinner Instead Of Writing His Next Book,N/A,https://clickhole.com/absolutely-infuriating-george-r-r-martin-wasted-time-1834001558/,"If you’re a fan of the A Song Of Ice And Fire novels, the following sentence is all but guaranteed to make your blood boil: George R.R. Martin has been wasting time eating dinner instead of writing his next book. This is a slap in the face to all his readers, and the smug old bastard knows it. You’d think George R.R. Martin would be hard at work plugging away at the sixth entry in his epic fantasy series, but apparently, taking upwards of 30 minutes per night to cavalierly prepare and then eat a full dinner is more important to this lackadaisical prick than his millions of long-suffering fans. Just yesterday, this selfish piece of shit microwaved himself a chicken quesadilla that could have been three pages of a new Tyrion-POV chapter if only Martin had a fucking ounce of self-restraint, and that’s not even mentioning the PB&J he took his sweet time eating for lunch. His loyal fans haven’t gotten a new Song Of Ice And Fire book since 2011, and yet night after night, Martin decides that eating a hot, sometimes multiple-item meal is somehow the more pressing concern despite the fact that he just had one LITERALLY the day before. Hey George—dinner will still be there after you finish your fucking book! The real tragedy of it all is that Martin is genuinely a masterful storyteller, but his ambition seems to stop at maintaining his streak of consecutive nights that he ate dinner instead of finishing his magnum opus fantasy series that people actually give a shit about. He could just as easily fill up a CamelBak with Soylent and power through the rest of The Winds Of Winter in no time, and it’s hard to read his refusal to do so as anything other than a big middle finger to the people who support him. It seems like the only way we’ll ever find out who winds up on the Iron Throne is by burning down every goddamn supermarket and restaurant in the country, because as long as eating dinner is an option for Martin, it’s clear that he’s going to pick it over finishing his damn books. Every. Single. Time. George, it’s time to put your nose to the grindstone and give all this “eating dinner” bullshit a rest. You’ll have plenty of time for frivolous time-wasters once you’re done writing, but you can only test the patience of your fans like this for so long. "
Devastating Setback: Elon Musk Has Murdered His Lemon With Legs After It Kicked Him In The Groin,N/A,https://clickhole.com/devastating-setback-elon-musk-has-murdered-his-lemon-w-1833851206/,"It seems that even the greatest innovators in the world are not immune to failure. Mere hours after informing the world that he was developing a lemon with legs that could sprint toward hungry people in need, Elon Musk just revealed that he has murdered that lemon after it used its legs to kick him in the groin. Musk made the heartbreaking announcement on Twitter earlier today: This is an absolutely devastating setback. One moment, Musk was boasting that his lemon with legs would end world hunger, and the next moment, the lemon had kicked him in the testicles so hard that he had to murder it. Science is truly a fickle mistress. Here’s hoping that Musk is able to move on from this massive failure and come up with another great idea soon!"
A Brilliant Innovator: Elon Musk Has Announced He Is Currently Developing A Lemon With Legs That Can Sprint To Hungry People All Over The World,N/A,https://clickhole.com/a-brilliant-innovator-elon-musk-has-announced-he-is-cu-1833851110/,"From PayPal to Tesla to SpaceX, Elon Musk has been one of the leading innovators of our age—a modern-day Thomas Edison ushering mankind toward a better future. And it looks like he has once again found a brilliant solution to one of mankind’s most pressing problems: Musk just announced that he is currently developing a lemon with legs that can sprint to hungry people all over the world. Incredible! Earlier today, Musk revealed that he has been working with scientists for the past three years to genetically engineer a lemon that has big, muscular human legs and can sprint in the direction of people facing starvation. When the lemon arrives, the lucky recipients can eat it, thus completely eliminating their poverty. Musk gave the world a glimpse into the amazing project by tweeting out a video of a lemon with human legs stumbling around a parking garage with the caption, “Just a little something I’ve been working on.” Although the lemon still has trouble balancing and can only sprint for five miles at a time before collapsing from exhaustion, Musk says he hopes the lemon will be able to sprint for up to 2,000 miles at a time by the end of this year. The SpaceX founder has been working with the best engineers and scientists in Silicon Valley and says that initial tests of the lemon with legs have been horrible, but that the thousands of problems they’re encountering will probably go away on their own without anybody doing anything. One of the most pressing issues is that the lemon does not have any eyes, so in order to successfully sprint toward a starving person, that person must constantly scream at the top of their lungs so that the lemon knows which way to sprint. Another difficulty Musk and his team have faced is that creating a lemon with human legs required murdering an honest, hard-working man in order to harvest his DNA. Musk says that he did not like murdering the man, but that sometimes murder is the only way to get fruit that has powerful human legs. He also notes that, despite some early production challenges, the lemon with legs is already generating serious excitement: The project has attracted swarms of investors from Silicon Valley, and venture capitalists have reportedly provided upwards of $2.6 billion in funding for the project so far. A handful of vocal detractors have criticized Musk’s lemon with legs project by claiming that a single lemon cannot provide a starving person with enough nutrition to survive, but Musk has dismissed these naysayers by claiming that they are all pedophiles. Check and mate! This is absolutely brilliant. Only someone as ingenious as Elon Musk could think of such an elegant solution to a daunting problem like world hunger. We can’t wait to see this lemon sprinting all over the place providing much-needed food to struggling people around the globe! UPDATE: According to new reports, Elon Musk has murdered his lemon with legs after it kicked him in the groin."
Heartwarming: Dick’s Sporting Goods Is Giving Free Baseball Bats To Scorned Women Who Just Caught Their Good-For-Nothin’ Boyfriends Cheating On Them,N/A,https://clickhole.com/heartwarming-dick-s-sporting-goods-is-giving-free-base-1833847758/,"With so many stories about corporate greed in the news, it’s refreshing to see a company doing some serious good: Dick’s Sporting Goods is giving away free baseball bats to scorned women who just caught their good-for-nothin’ boyfriends cheating on them. Wow! This is so heartwarming. Dick’s announced that as of this week, women who’ve just found out that their man’s been two-timing them with some homewrecker from the next town over will be able to score a free baseball bat from the sports retailer that they can use to teach that no-good son-of-a-gun a lesson he won’t soon forget. If you happen to discover that your man is really a lying shuckster who’ll wet his wick between any set of gams he can, just present a Dick’s cashier with proof of his betrayal, whether it’s some other tramp’s lipstick on the collar of his work blues or a receipt you dug out of the trash for the sleazy pay-by-the-hour motel down off the highway. You’ll then be presented with your bat, empowering you to drive over to the bar where his beloved truck is always parked out front and smash those headlights to smithereens. “The last thing a woman who just caught her man goin’ ’round her back needs to worry about is covering the cost of the bat she needs to give him what’s comin’ to him for lettin’ them blue eyes of his start wanderin’,” said Dick’s in a press release. “Don’t waste another tear on that skirt-chasin’ sumbitch. Bring your pretty self on down to Dick’s, get yourself a bat, and go do some body work on your man’s truck, ’cause if that two-bit casanova thinks he can just throw your heart to the dogs like yesterday’s ham steak, then he’s got another thing comin’.” Dick’s went on to note that each bat is cut from a single switch of premium white ash, just like the bats the big-leaguers use, with a sweet spot in the barrel that’ll make easy work of anything that cheatin’ scoundrel of yours holds dear, whether it’s that record player he spends more time with than you or that genuine gold wristwatch that he got from his grandaddy. The company urged women not to feel any guilt about smashing such valuable belongings, as there’s no way they’re worth more than the three good years you wasted with that no-good, back-stabbin’ whore-hound. Awesome! It’s so great to see a major company like Dick’s Sporting Goods giving back to the community, and these bats will definitely go a long way towards giving women the courage they need to send their lousy deadbeat boyfriends away on the next train outta town for foolin’ around on the best thing that’s ever happened to them. Way to go, Dick’s!"
"AOC Scam! Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Claims To Be Poor, But This Painting Clearly Shows Her Wearing An Expensive Pearl Earring",N/A,https://clickhole.com/aoc-scam-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-claims-to-be-poor-b-1833721794/,"Liberal ditz Alexandria Ocrazy’o-Cortez has spouted off a lot of dumb lies, but the freshman congresswoman’s biggest fib of all might be herself. She claims to be part of the working class, but there’s evidence to the contrary. This painting of AOC proves she’s rich by showing her wearing an expensive pearl earring. Sorry AOC, but your grift is over. A “regular girl from the Bronx” couldn’t afford a museum-quality pearl so large and valuable, idiot!  Remember when Olying’o-Cortez claimed she couldn’t afford to rent an apartment in D.C.? If that’s true, why is she living large, wearing a turban made of luxurious yellow-and-blue silks? AOC wants the public to view her as an ordinary person, but her amazing pearl earring and incredible outfit prove she’s part of the wealthy 1% that she whines about so incessantly. Huh, gee, it looks like capitalism isn’t so bad when it comes to buying priceless pearl jewelry you can flaunt in paintings.  AOC’s entire backstory appears full of holes when you glance at this painting. Olazy’o-Snoretez claims to have worked as a bartender to make ends meet. But if she really had a demanding server job like that, then why is the expression on her luminous face so enigmatic—half-smiling, half-beguiling—instead of looking exhausted after working a double shift? Checkmate, AOCidiots.  Maybe we should change AOC’s initials to AOP (Alexandria Owning-Pearl) because that’s a more honest description of this liberal huckster. Little Miss Green New Dunce says she supports socialism, but this shocking image proves that she’s willing to spend her private millions commissioning beautiful portraits of herself wearing imported fabrics and luxurious pearl earrings. Sorry, liberals, but it looks like the only elected office AOC will be running for any time soon is Queen Of The Hypocrites. Time send her packing!"
"Now That Univision Isn’t Our Corporate Owner Anymore, We’re Free To Rip Into Their Dumbass Logo",N/A,https://clickhole.com/now-that-univision-isn-t-our-corporate-owner-anymore-w-1833891542/,"For the past three years, we’ve been under the ownership of the Spanish-language media conglomerate Univision. During that time, we have been nothing but dutiful and respectful to our corporate owners, resisting any and all temptation to criticize them publicly, no matter how badly we wanted to speak up. Yesterday, however, it was announced that Univision had sold us to a private equity firm, which means we’re finally free to speak our minds. And if there’s one thing we’d like to say about Univision, it’s this: Their logo is goofy as fuck. It’s a real stinker, folks! After constantly seeing their dumbass logo on company emails and documents over the past few years, we’ve come to assume that it’s meant to be a stylized rendering of the letter U, but one will notice that it is a very weird and bad-looking U. The purple part of the U, for instance, is limp and deflated in a way that is not typical of the letter U, and it’s unclear why this is the case—it certainly does not look cool. It’s also unclear is why the logo is divided into four colorful sections, and what each of the colors is meant to represent. The red is obvious (blood of Christ), but what about the other colors? It is frustrating not knowing, and, honestly, just a plain letter U in Times New Roman would be much more effective than whatever the hell Univision was going for here. From the way the U in the logo is filled in, you get the sense Univision was trying to make it look like a shield or a badge of sorts, but there isn’t enough detail to provide any certainty on what it’s actually supposed to be. By not committing to anything definitive, they’ve teed it up for crass interpretation, giving the sneering no-goodniks of the world an open invitation to make such base assessments as, “It looks like if the Windows logo had an 80-pound tumor growing on the inside,” or ,“It resembles a urinal from the future.” While under Univision’s ownership, we were greatly distressed by how bland and asinine the logo looked but were always forced to bite our tongues, and it’s incredibly refreshing to finally be able to say, without fear of reprisal, that it is a stupid logo that only a moron could like. Good logos should speak for themselves. You look at the NBC peacock and you immediately think NBC, but you look at the Univision logo and just become sad and confused about what the fuck it is. They helpfully added the word “Univision” underneath in boring-ass gray text for clarity, but that shouldn’t be necessary. You should be able to look at the logo and say, “Ah, yes, Univision, the channel that airs telenovelas all day and for some reason owned The Onion.” Univision doesn’t own us anymore, so we don’t owe them anything, but we’ll do a little bit more work for them free of charge. Here are some ideas for better logos that they’re welcome to use if they ever pull their heads out of their asses: The letter U inside a TV, conveying a theme of television The letter U with an eyeball in it, conveying a theme of using one’s eyes to watch television Planet Earth with the letter U on it The letter U with planet Earth inside of it The word “Univision,” but in a badass bold font that doesn’t fuck around A nude Herculean man lifting the word “Univision” high over his head, conveying a theme of UNIVISION = STRONG All of these logo options would look awesome and would make people fucking pumped about Univision, unlike their current aseptic and impotent design, which bores people to the point where they want to take their own lives. Hopefully, Univision will take our advice and consider changing their logo to something that doesn’t totally suck chode, but since our financial wellbeing is no longer intertwined with theirs, we really don’t care either way. Farewell, Univision! Sorry things didn’t work out and we had to get a divorce."

As of right now, Cory Booker is the only Democrat in the race who is stepping up and making Kate McKinnon’s unparalleled talent for mimicry and physical comedy a priority for his campaign. Booker first laid out his thrilling vision for the next four years of SNL at a town hall in Newark, where he said he was “100% committed” to choosing a running mate who “either straight-up looks like Kate McKinnon or is the kind of small, weird character that you just know Kate would absolutely nail if she put on a funny wig.” The announcement was met with nearly a minute of enthusiastic applause.  But Booker didn’t stop there—when questioned further about his plans for the future, the New Jersey senator doubled down, saying, “With your help, I’d like to build an America where Kate McKinnon could be doing an incredible impression of my VP on ‘Weekend Update’ and then, as a crazy surprise, my VP actually shows up in the studio and is all, like, ‘Kate, is that really how I sound?’”  Wow—it sounds like Cory Booker is definitely the real deal. This latest policy initiative could be a major draw for that crucial block of voters who feel like no candidate has yet to offer them a laugh-out-loud alternative to Alec Baldwin’s totally spot-on impression of Donald Trump.  Since his announcement, Booker’s website has already been updated with a list of criteria he will use to select a running mate that he sincerely hopes will win Kate McKinnon her third Emmy, proving that his promise is not just empty words. Booker’s plan truly takes all fans of Saturday Night Live into account, prioritizing potential VP candidates with wives who look like Maya Rudolph on behalf of citizens who hope to see an old SNL cast member do a cameo in 2020, as well as candidates with goofy sons that Kyle Mooney and Beck Bennett could play for all the comedy nerds who love their off-kilter comedic sensibilities. Impressive. With this bold endorsement of Kate McKinnon’s character work, it looks like Booker may have really found the cornerstone issue of his campaign. There’s no doubt other candidates will soon be forced to detail their own plans to turn SNL into must-see TV this election season, so be sure to keep an eye on the news as the race to the White House heats up!"
A Reckless Administration: The White House Reportedly Granted Cousin Itt Full Security Clearance And He Immediately Ran Off With The Nuclear Briefcase,N/A,https://clickhole.com/a-reckless-administration-the-white-house-reportedly-g-1833726216/,"The Trump administration has always played fast and loose with standard vetting procedures for Oval Office personnel, but an incident this morning proved just how disastrous the consequences of Trump’s disregard for basic protocol can be: Earlier today, the White House reportedly granted Cousin Itt full security clearance and he immediately ran off with the nuclear briefcase. Whoa. This is not okay. According to reports, the White House Personnel Security Office had originally denied clearance to Cousin Itt, citing numerous concerns including “vulnerability to foreign influence, connections to the notorious Addams Family, and sexual misconduct,” only for their decision to be personally overruled by President Trump in spite of repeated warnings. Inside sources allege that just minutes after Cousin Itt’s application was officially approved, he burst into the Oval Office, yanked the briefcase containing launch codes for America’s nuclear arsenal—commonly known as the “nuclear football”—away from the military aide charged with protecting it, and ran out of sight with it into the streets of D.C. The Secret Service and FBI immediately launched a large-scale manhunt, and soon after, a long-haired suspect believed to be Cousin Itt was neutralized by gunfire only to then be identified as a Yorkshire terrier. As of press time, Cousin Itt remains at large. This incident is only more infuriating considering how preventable it was. Cousin Itt reportedly failed to meet even the most basic standards necessary for top-secret clearance under White House protocol, and his interview with Personnel officials was rife was with red flags including not providing any form of personal identification, refusing to remove his bowler hat or sunglasses to take a photo for his security badge, and insisting he enter the building through the chimney. Any other administration would have immediately recognized Cousin Itt as wholly unfit for access to sensitive intelligence, but Trump simply waved off officials’ concerns and demanded that “Cousin Itt, my longtime friend—and a great man with total loyalty!—be granted the highest level of security clearance.” Unsurprisingly, Trump’s press team is already trying to spin this PR disaster into a success, asserting that our nation’s nuclear codes are safer than ever before in Cousin Itt’s hands, and that if Cousin Itt launches a nuclear attack, President Trump completely trusts his judgement. What an absolutely disgraceful situation. People’s lives are now at risk because our nation’s top officials think the law doesn’t apply to their personal associates. If you weren’t questioning this administration’s integrity before, you must be now in light of this incredibly alarming incident. Let’s hope President Trump gets his act together and starts taking vetting seriously because it is completely unacceptable for the leader of the free world to behave this recklessly."
"Major Pivot: Bernie Sanders Has Become
Staunchly Capitalist After Tasting Mountain Dew Code Red And Learning It Was
Made By A Corporation",N/A,https://clickhole.com/major-pivot-bernie-sanders-has-become-staunchly-capita-1833587467/,"The presidential race just got shaken up! Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders announced he is now fervently capitalist after tasting Mountain Dew Code Red for the first time and learning it was made by a corporation.  Wow. This is a major pivot from Sanders’ former platform of wanting to increase taxes on wealthy companies, and it’s bound to have massive ramifications for the 2020 election! Bernie Sanders was on a campaign stop at an Iowa diner when he quenched his thirst with a bottle of Mountain Dew Code Red. After the avowed socialist took one sip of the cherry-flavored soft drink, his eyes widened in amazement. People nearby heard Sanders yell, “This beverage is marvelous, absolutely marvelous! Fizzy, sweet, and the color is an appealing rosy hue. I want to meet the hard-working American chef who made this spectacular drink!” Staffers then informed Sanders that Code Red wasn’t made by an employee at the diner, but was instead manufactured by PepsiCo. After gasping in shock, the Vermont senator reportedly muttered, “I’ve been so foolish. All these years wasted trying to raise corporate tax rates. Corporations are wonderful. Corporations gave us the gift of Code Red.” Sanders then gave an impromptu speech to supporters, explaining that an economic system of unchecked capitalism was essential to produce “the finest, reddest sodas in the world,” and that if he became president, he would do everything he could to realize that dream. He also warned that laws enacting worker protections like a higher minimum wage or paid time off would “only impede the geniuses of the soft drink industry, who need free reign to manufacture scarlet Mountain Dew without big government getting in the way.” As of this morning, Sanders’ website has updated to reflect his new pro-corporation stance. The senator has also dropped his support of Medicare For All, long a cornerstone of his political program, with his site explaining that, “instead of expecting handouts, Americans who want healthcare should start a soda company and get money for their medical bills by selling a delightful red soft drink.” This is definitely a big change for the former progressive candidate, and it will be interesting to see if Sanders can carry this new pro-capitalist ideology all the way to the White House. If anyone can convince voters that corporations deserve way more money so that America can maximize its production of Mountain Dew Code Red, it’s a grassroots hero like Bernie Sanders. Other Democratic candidates should definitely take note, because Bernie just changed the game!"
Progress: Iowa Has Officially Replaced Columbus Day With Columbus Hour,N/A,https://clickhole.com/progress-iowa-has-officially-replaced-columbus-day-wit-1833404927/,"As more and more Americans become enlightened about the real history behind Christopher Columbus and his brutal exploitation of indigenous peoples, many are struggling to reckon with the explorer’s problematic legacy. One state, however, just drew a stark line in the sand: Iowa has officially replaced Columbus Day with Columbus Hour. Wow. Now this is a step in the right direction! The Iowa General Assembly passed the historic measure earlier this week in a blunt rebuke of Columbus’s complicated past. “We can no longer ignore the many atrocities Christopher Columbus committed against the native inhabitants of this country, and, moving forward, we will no longer dedicate more than one hour each year to celebrating his memory,” said Iowa governor Kim Reynolds in a statement. With this forward-thinking change, the state has struck a more sensible balance between honoring tradition and acknowledging historical wrongs, as Iowans can still enjoy the annual Columbus-related events they’re accustomed to but in an abbreviated form. For example, Sioux City’s Columbus Day Parade, which has drawn criticism in the past for turning a blind eye to Columbus’s barbaric violence against Native Americans, will now be a much quicker affair, with the marchers doing a brisk jog to fit in all the jubilant floats and performances in under an hour. Schools and workplaces will also be let out as they always have, but only for an hour, requiring students and employees to hurry back once the 60 minutes of Columbus fanfare are up. While stores will still be holding their annual Columbus Day sales events, they too will be limited to an hour, and many businesses will not be offering as good of bargains as in previous years so as not to appear overly celebratory. Awesome! By demoting Columbus Day to Columbus Hour, Iowa is making major progress toward confronting the dark reality of our nation’s past, setting a bold precedent for the rest of the country. Here’s hoping more states follow Iowa’s lead in toning down their sanctioned glorification of historic racial violence. Way to go, Iowa!"
Powerful Protest: An Anti-Animal Activist Group Just Snuck 3 Orcas Into SeaWorld,N/A,https://clickhole.com/powerful-protest-an-anti-animal-activist-group-just-sn-1833471333/,"In recent years, SeaWorld has faced serious backlash for treating animals inhumanely—so much so that the company has begun to make major changes to its parks. But it looks like one group of protesters is not about to let the theme park discontinue their highly criticized orca exhibits without a fight: Last night, an anti-animal activist group snuck three orcas into SeaWorld San Diego. What a powerful act of defiance! This news is sure to brighten any animal-hater’s day. Members of the anti-animal rights organization Working Against The Protection Of Animals have taken credit for an operation during which a group of activists captured three wild orcas from their natural environment in the Atlantic Ocean and sneaked them into a glass tank at SeaWorld’s San Diego location. Working tirelessly through the night, volunteers for the nonprofit organization bypassed the park’s security system and put their lives at risk to lower the large aquatic mammals into the park’s orca enclosure, all in the hopes that even just three more of these animals will lead miserable lives of boredom and isolation. “Orcas are highly intelligent creatures, and it’s up to us to ensure that they are crammed into tiny little tanks and forced to perform for screaming children for hours on end until the day they die prematurely,” the group declared in a statement on their website this morning. “It is simply unconscionable that thousands upon thousands of these magnificent animals exist in the wild where they can thrive physically, socially and emotionally. Critics will point out that our protest violated the law, but if our work means that even three more orcas can have their dorsal fins collapse from a lack of proper care, it will have been worth it.” Incredible. You might not agree with the tactics they employ, but the fact that members of WAPA are willing to risk jail time to make sure that just a few more animals will live out their days in cramped tanks is proof that they truly practice what they preach. One thing is for certain: Their protest made a powerful statement and highlighted some of the tireless work done by anti-animals rights activists in the U.S.."
Incredible Humility: Warren Buffett Just Revealed That He Always Flies Cargo Instead Of First Class,N/A,https://clickhole.com/incredible-humility-warren-buffett-just-revealed-that-1833332898/,"Income inequality is more rampant than ever, and while many billionaires choose to rub it in by flaunting vulgar displays of wealth, one of the world’s richest men is instead making a case for living life modestly: Warren Buffett has revealed that he always flies cargo instead of first class. It’s refreshing to see that at least one billionaire hasn’t let his money go to his head! In a recent interview with Forbes, Buffett shared that whenever he flies, he forgoes the comforts of first class to sit in a crate alongside the luggage and pets underneath the plane. The 88-year-old investor explained that his decision to travel in the less spacious, bathroom-free cargo hold has nothing to do with saving money—he’s just perfectly content with the simple things in life. Whether it’s an hour-long domestic flight or a 20-hour red-eye across the globe, Buffett sees no reason to waste hundreds of dollars on a luxury seat when he could instead donate that money to charity and be just as happy flying crouched in a large dog carrier with a Xanax and a 2-liter bottle of Coca-Cola to drink along the way. “I’m an incredibly fortunate person, but I don’t like to make a show of my wealth or act like I’m above being stowed away with people’s suitcases and golf bags in dark, sometimes unpressurized cargo holds,” said Buffett. “The leg room, the beverage service, the televisions—it’s just not for me is all. Throw some hay in the crate, give me a nudie magazine, and I’ll be fine underneath the plane. I didn’t get to where I am today buying expensive things I don’t need, and I certainly don’t feel the need to start now.” Wow. Coming from someone who could easily buy an entire fleet of private jets, it’s amazing to see that Buffett is still so down-to-earth. Take note, 1-percenters, because this man’s lifestyle proves that affluence and humility don’t need to be mutually exclusive. Kudos to you, Mr. Buffett! "
Patriots Rejoice! Donald Trump Has Appointed Professor Rat As The U.S. Secretary Of Fireworks,N/A,https://clickhole.com/patriots-rejoice-donald-trump-has-appointed-professor-1833071140/,"When Professor Rat, the man-sized rat wearing a graduation cap and gown, first emerged from the ocean 30 years ago, everyone’s first question was, “Will this man-sized rat one day become the United States Secretary of Fireworks?” And today, we have learned that the answer to that question is a resounding “Yes!” Just this morning, our mighty leader President Donald Trump appointed Professor Rat as the U.S. Secretary of Fireworks, and our country will never be the same! Patriots rejoice! Our great nation just became a little more MAGA! President Donald JOHN Trump took to Twitter early this morning to announce the amazing news that America’s fireworks were now safe in the large paws of Professor Rat: As the U.S. Secretary of Fireworks, Professor Rat will watch pornography, guard America’s precious fireworks from terrorists and thieves, give awards and cash prizes to people who set off fireworks indoors, and do experiments to discover a way to make fireworks that sound like someone sneezing when they explode. Considering that Professor Rat eats garbage like a rat and drives a Porsche like a human, President Trump could not have picked a more perfect genius to steer American fireworks into the new millennium! Nobody knows where Professor Rat came from. All we know about his past is that he graduated from Harvard. However, ever since he emerged from the ocean he has been doing experiments, eating garbage, and inventing things. Professor Rat became famous for groundbreaking discoveries in the fields of physics and astronomy, and for conducting an insane and unethical science experiment on a dog, which taught the world nothing. He is a perfect choice for Secretary of Fireworks from our Perfect President (J. Trump)! Professor Rat also once invented a type of portable oven that catches fire every time you use it, which is a terrible invention, but is actually quite amazing considering that Professor Rat has the brain of a rat and it’s a miracle he was able to build any type of machine at all. Congratulations to Donald JOHN Trump, the President of the United States, on his amazing new addition to his perfect cabinet! We can’t wait to see how loud American fireworks becomes under the leadership of the scientific genius of Professor Rat!! UPDATE: Professor Rat is a man-sized rat that wears a graduation cap and gown. He bit Donald Jr. on BOTH legs."
Mind-Blowing History: This Photo Of U.S. And Iraqi Soldiers Banding Together To Disembowel An Elvis Impersonator During The Gulf War Will Take Your Breath Away,N/A,https://clickhole.com/mind-blowing-history-this-photo-of-u-s-and-iraqi-sold-1832985299/,"Even in history’s darkest, most brutal wars, there are times when people find a way to place love and compassion above hatred and unite together in a shared humanity. One recently uncovered photograph from the Gulf War that’s been taking the internet by storm is an amazingly hopeful example of just that: The photo shows U.S. and Iraqi soldiers banding together to disembowel an Elvis impersonator. Wow. What an absolutely breathtaking display of brotherhood transcending conflict. The picture, taken by photojournalist Kenneth Parker, only becomes more incredible once you know the story behind it. It was at the peak Operation Desert Storm that the Elvis impersonator in the photo sauntered onto the battlefield in the town of Al Bassaya to make disparaging remarks about both President George H.W. Bush and Saddam Hussein, mumbling, “President Books and Samantha Hussein ain’t nothin’ but momma June bugs in a tin-roof rain gutter, mhm, huh-ya, and that’s coming from the King, honey.” That’s when both American and Iraqi soldiers temporarily stopped fighting one another and joined together to hold the Elvis look-a-like on the ground, rip open his bejeweled jumpsuit, and gut him alive, yanking out his intestines and holding them in front of his trembling gold-rimmed sunglasses as he screamed “Lord have mercy on the King!” still in-character. Several U.S. soldiers present at the gutting depicted in the photo reportedly even offered Iraqi troops water to wipe the Elvis impersonator’s entrails off their uniforms, a gesture that’s as beautiful as it is miraculous when you consider that their units were engaged in a vicious tank battle just an hour prior. You’d be hard-pressed to find a more perfect example of man’s inherently good nature than the sight of an Iraqi soldier handing the Elvis impersonator’s exposed, still-beating heart to an American soldier, generously offering his enemy the honor of stuffing it inside the Elvis impersonator’s mouth as the life faded from his eyes and his body slowly stopped imitating the soul-singer’s signature shimmies and hip thrusts until it was completely still. This photo is definitely the most heartwarming image you’re going to see all day. “Though both sets of troops returned to fighting one another after the Elvis impersonator had been completely disemboweled and lay dead next to a pile of his own organs in the Iraqi desert, for that brief moment, Americans and Iraqis saw each other more as fellow men than enemies,” Parker said of his powerful photograph. “War always results in unspeakable horrors, but when you see two opposing nations put aside their differences to hollow out the body cavity of a man imitating Elvis Presley, it reminds you that wars are fought by human beings, just as capable of love and brotherhood as they are of fighting each other.” In a time when America remains engaged in several unending wars and it seems like violent conflict will never end, it’s images like these that offer a ray of hope that the world can finally find peace. This is the kind of history humanity should be learning from! "
"Journalism Win: ‘The Washington Post’ Announced
That Everyone Is Born With 10,000 Pinocchios And Has To Remove Them By Living A
Lifetime Of Honesty",N/A,https://clickhole.com/journalism-win-the-washington-post-announced-that-ev-1833211416/,"The Washington Post has long kept politicians honest with their Pinocchio rating system, but now it looks like the paper is ready to bring their crusade for truth unto all of mankind. Today the Post announced that all humans are born with 10,000 Pinocchios and can only be freed of the stain of dishonesty by living a life of virtuous truth. Bravo, WaPo! The public needs to know that they come into this world already guilty of making misleading statements and must strive to purify themselves of this inherent deceit. “Upon our first breath out of the womb, each baby is already tainted by 10,000 Pinocchios, an inheritance of lies beget from humanity’s countless whoppers,” wrote reporter Glenn Kessler in the Post’s “Fact Checker” blog. “Unless you act to cleanse yourself of these fibs, you shall take the Pinocchios to your grave and spend eternity damned as a liar, liar, pants on fire.” Fortunately, Kessler revealed that we can escape the burden of our inherited tall tales by adhering to the path of honesty for all our days. “For each hard truth you admit, you will be absolved of between one and four Pinocchios based on the magnitude of your courage,” the Fact Checker explained. “Slowly and gradually over the course of decades, our Pinocchios can be stripped away, like a mountain eroded into sand by the ever-patient wind, until at last we are rewarded with the infinite bliss of a Geppetto Checkmark of veracity.” “Hark!” added Kessler. “Beware the temptation of the mostly true statement, the false idol that deceives only through lies of omission. This verbal trickery will not hide your untruths from the all-seeing eyes of the Pinocchios.” Thank you, Washington Post, for letting the public know they must penitently work to achieve salvation from the exaggerated inaccuracies of our ancestors. It’s good to know that quality journalism still exists!"
Nature Is Incredible: Biologists Have Captured Rare Photos Of Two Mutually Beneficial Species Exchanging Business Cards,N/A,https://clickhole.com/nature-is-incredible-biologists-have-captured-rare-pho-1833063586/,"In case you need a reminder of just how amazing nature is, here’s an exciting example of animals cooperating in a truly extraordinary way: Biologists have captured rare photos of two mutually beneficial species exchanging business cards. Unbelievable! Earlier this week, researchers in the Nile Delta witnessed a crocodile and a plover bird exchanging business cards, becoming the first humans to ever capture this remarkable behavior on camera. The stunning photographs document the crocodile as it makes a phone gesture with its claw before extending its business card to the plover, who receives the card and squawks with gratitude. The plover then extends its own business card to the crocodile, who slaps its head against the dirt as if to telegraph a desire to stay in touch about working together in the future. The mesmerizing sequence provides a glimpse into an incredible moment of cooperation between two wildly different species, revealing how even animals at opposite ends of the food chain must depend on each other to expand their professional networks and find lucrative new business opportunities in their unforgiving ecosystems. What may at first glance seem like a random encounter between a bird and a reptile is actually the product of hundreds of millions of years of precise evolutionary conditioning: The plover appears to have an innate understanding of the exact amount of eye contact required to seem engaged but not overeager, while the crocodile seems to intuit just how to flare its nostrils to signal polite receptiveness but without making any concrete commitments right away. Though the crocodile could easily eat the plover, it grasps the importance of maintaining ongoing email relationships with opposing species in order to position it for optimal success in their wetland economy.  It is truly a breathtaking sight to behold. The astounding synchronicity between this crocodile and plover highlights the great importance of each and every species—from the lowliest shorebirds to the mightiest predators—in maintaining a fruitful and collaborative business climate in which ideas can be freely exchanged and innovative solutions can be reached to the collective benefit of all wildlife. There’s no doubt that researchers will be learning from this haunting interspecies dance for years to come. Wow!"
Shutting Down The Haters: Bernie Sanders Just Proved He’s Young Enough To Run For President By Hiring A Team Of Bodyguards That Are All 20 Years Older Than Him,N/A,https://clickhole.com/shutting-down-the-haters-bernie-sanders-just-proved-he-1833063441/,"The gloves have already come off in what’s shaping up to be a contentious Democratic primary, but one 2020 hopeful just got out ahead of his detractors by masterfully shutting down one of their favorite arguments: Bernie Sanders just proved he’s young enough to run for president by hiring a team of bodyguards that are all 20 years older than him. Checkmate, naysayers! You can’t possibly look at this decrepit squad of nonagenarians and say that Bernie’s as old as them. Sanders debuted his new team of ancient bodyguards yesterday morning by having them run security at an Ohio town hall event, and watching them feebly shuffle around the auditorium and struggle to open heavy doors made it abundantly clear that being a spry, young 77 like Sanders is no barrier to becoming president. While the bodyguards were selected to be 97 at the youngest, several of them are well into the triple digits, and anyone who thinks that Bernie missed his chance to run for president should guess again after seeing him juxtaposed with armed men two decades his senior. Of course, the extremely elderly bodyguards would be of little to no use in the event of an actual security threat, but considering how agile Bernie looks next to a wizened 103-year-old clinging to the railing as he slowly ascends a flight of stairs, the benefits to Bernie’s image as a viable candidate far outweigh the risks. Ageists, consider yourselves officially shut down! “I’d had my worries about Bernie being too old for the presidency, but after watching him have to personally help his elderly security team out of his motorcade because it was too large of a step for them to manage alone, I can say with confidence that Sanders is a perfect candidate,” said Ellen Barker, one of the attendees at the Ohio town hall. “I honestly don’t think anyone could look at Bernie walking three times as fast as an aged bodyguard trying to keep up with him and come to a different conclusion.”  Unfortunately, two of Bernie’s incredibly frail bodyguards have already had to step down due to sprains sustained on the job, and one passed away in his sleep after dozing off while guarding the entryway, but as long as Sanders can hang on to a few elderly bodyguards throughout the Democratic primary, the Vermont senator should have no trouble convincing voters that he’s comparatively still in his prime. Whether or not he’s got your vote, you’ve got to hand it to Bernie Sanders that his very old bodyguards have totally shut down any attacks about his age. Sorry, haters, but this is what it feels like to get outplayed!"

And boy, oh boy, it’s shaping up to be a banner week for news that means absolutely jackshit to us because according to, like, 50 of our fucking Facebook friends who live in Rhode Island and are spamming the hell out of our newsfeed, there’s gonna be, like, four inches of snow in Rhode Island this week, and we truly couldn’t care less because—news flash!—Rhode Island weather is not our fucking problem.

Trump To The Rescue: The Fat White Boy Who Was Expelled For Getting Fully Nude On The School Bus To Change Into His Dashiki Was Invited To The White House,N/A,https://clickhole.com/trump-to-the-rescue-the-fat-white-boy-who-was-expelled-1832834776/,"Patriots!!! If you are still disturbed by how P.C. culture got that fat white boy expelled just for getting 100 percent nude on the school bus to wear a dashiki earlier this week, we have a BEAUTIFUL update to that story that just goes to show how INCREDIBLE our President Trump is! Our mighty leader, President Donald J. Trump, has invited the fat white boy to the White House!!! Rubin O’Leary, the fat white boy, must feel so proud to hear that President Donald John Trump Sr. has his back! See, libs? The Prez just proved there’s nothing “politically correct” about doing the right thing! As soon as President Trump heard how PC culture had ruined this fat white boy’s life (OVER NOTHING!), he knew he had to use his platform to speak out and let every fat white boy know that it’s okay for them to get naked on the bus and put on a dashiki, no matter how much Demo-crazies whine that it’s “culturally insensitive” or “indecent exposure!” Check out President Trump’s official tweet inviting the fat white boy to come visit him in Washington below:  The fat white boy not only took up the president on his amazing offer, but also received a true patriot’s welcome at the White House! After giving the lucky, overweight white boy a tour of the Oval Office, Trump himself got fully naked to put on his own dashiki right alongside the fat white boy! It was an absolutely heartwarming gesture that was made all the more special by what happened next: The fat white boy was informed he’d been invited to join the Army, and that he’d also received $20 million in donations towards his college education from compassionate American PATRIOTS across the country who’d heard his heart-wrenching story! Sorry libs, but the scores are in. PC culture: 0 points. President Trump: 1,776 points!!! We are SO relieved that this fat white boy’s nightmare story has a happy ending—all thanks to the best president this country’s ever had! It’s moments like this that remind you no matter how many mentally ill libs are trying to pervert our freedoms, America is in good hands with President J. Trump (Donald)! God bless him!!!"
PC Culture Run Amok: This Fat White Boy Was Expelled Just For Getting Fully Nude On The School Bus To Change Into His Dashiki,N/A,https://clickhole.com/pc-culture-run-amok-this-fat-white-boy-was-expelled-ju-1832834535/,"Every single day, the SJW cuck armada tries to enforce a new rule about what Americans “can” or “can’t” do in this country. But this week, the P.C.-police stooped to a new low entirely and proved once and for all that political correctness is the biggest threat to our God-given rights as patriot-blooded Americans: This fat white boy was expelled just for getting fully nude on the school bus to change into his dashiki! Oh, so it’s “problematic” for an overweight white boy to get totally naked on the bus to put on a dashiki? Truly, lib-logic is the result of serious mental illness! Yesterday morning, Rubin O’Leary, a fat white boy at Lenape Middle School in Doylestown, PA was minding his own business in the seat closest to the school bus driver when he stripped completely nude to put on a dashiki that perfectly covered the upper half of his body. Though Rubin did not hurt ANYBODY, he was met with outrage from the soy-infected bus driver, who apparently thought it was so “offensive” for fat white boys to get naked on the bus to change into African garments that he threatened to report Rubin if he didn’t put his clothes back on. Once Rubin got off the bus, still in nothing but his dashiki, a school security guard blocked him from heading to class and instead took Rubin to the principal’s office, where he was told he was not allowed to come to school anymore. Hmm. It seems pretty obvious to any true PATRIOT that if Rubin had been an African-American boy who wore a dashiki and never exposed himself in front of his classmates, he would still be in school. But just because you’re fat, white, and stripping completely naked to wear a dashiki, you get punished for it today. That’s how INSANE PC culture in this country has become! “When I heard the reason why my fat white son had been expelled and that I had to find a new school for him to attend, I was consumed by rage,” said Chuck O’Leary, Rubin’s father and a gun owner. “It’s just so sad to know that our children are growing up in a time where you can’t be a fat white boy in America who gets naked on a moving public school bus to change into a dashiki. Since when did the PC police get to say that was an unacceptable thing to do in our country?” Teachers like the ones who punished Rubin are brainwashing our children with beta-ideologies each day, and it should fill all patriots with uncontrollable anger! With this disgusting incident, political correctness has officially been taken too far in America. For all the libs who’ve never read the Constitution, here are a few basic facts about America for you: Fat white boys CAN get naked in front of other people to wear traditional West African clothes, Democrats have NO PLACE in schools, and PC culture DOES NOT BELONG in America!  PatriotHole stands proudly with this fat white boy because he did NOTHING wrong!!! UPDATE: Incredible news, patriots!!! President Trump has once again saved the day by inviting the fat white boy to the White House!"
"Lucky To Be Alive: Harrison
Ford Got His Sleeve Caught In His Computer’s Floppy Disk Drive And Was Sucked
Into Cyberspace",N/A,https://clickhole.com/lucky-to-be-alive-harrison-ford-got-his-sleeve-caught-1832659778/,"Yikes, this was too close.  According to his publicist, Harrison Ford has been hospitalized after getting his sleeve caught in his computer’s floppy disk drive and being sucked into cyberspace. After getting yanked into the computer, the Star Wars actor found himself flying through a tunnel made of glowing 0s and 1s as the celeb uncontrollably tumbled into the digital realm. Ford tried to scream for help, but when his mouth opened, he only produced the dial-up modem sound. The Blade Runner star then appeared 1 centimeter tall on a computer desktop, precariously standing on an icon of a folder. The shrunken A-lister pressed his hands against the inside of the screen and was annoyed to find out he was now trapped within the machine. It was at this moment that Ford was conked on the head by a moving mouse cursor, causing him to lose his balance and plummet off the folder, falling down until he landed on a globe with the words “World Wide Web” on it.  Hitting the globe teleported him into a poorly animated CGI model of a red convertible, driving past a road sign that said “Information Superhighway.” Ford carefully steered the virtual car onto a four-lane freeway paved across an infinite grid of green lines over a black void, avoiding other vehicles that had labels on them like “Email” or “Online Shopping.” Things were going well until the Indiana Jones thespian glanced into an adjacent car labeled “Sexy Photos” and noticed it was being driven by a computer program that looked like a pink cube with feminine eyes and lips. Ford began flirting with the cube and tried to seduce it by turning his head into a yellow winky face emoji and blowing a kiss that produced a pixelated red heart, causing the cube to blush and emit the letters “LOL.” While distracted by his attempts to woo the software, Ford collided head-first into an oncoming semi truck full of cat GIFs. The resulting explosion launched the acclaimed actor out of the wreckage of his car, and he painfully smashed through a roadside banner ad for hemorrhoid cream before crash-landing on a giant Manhattan-sized motherboard that was a city for the programs who lived there, filled with houses and office buildings that were huge computer chips but with doors and windows. As the dazed celeb stumbled past a sign that said “Welcome to Mainframe City,” through streets made of exposed circuitry, he caught his breath by resting one hand on a button that said “Solitaire.exe,” accidentally booting up that program and transporting him to a blank green background full of playing cards. The aging but still handsome Hollywood hunk then flirted with the Queen of Spades by using his finger to write “a/s/l?” in letters that appeared floating midair, earning a seductive giggle from both queen’s top half and also from her upside down head. This enraged both heads on the King of Spades, who then began sword fighting with the American Graffiti leading man.  After parrying the king’s blows with a number six he grabbed from a nearby card and used like a fencing foil, Ford made a quick escape by jumping onto a clip art surfboard and surfing the web to safety atop a giant tidal wave made of ASCII keyboard characters. Ford was initially relieved, until he noticed that the wave was carrying him directly towards a skyscraper-sized trash can where barges were unloading files for erasure. The tsunami flung the Air Force One entertainer into the garbage pail, and he toppled down into a garbage dump filled with mountains of deleted spam. Dusting himself off, the Academy Award winner was alarmed to find out that the trash was infested by computer viruses, which inside the computer appeared as giant software bugs. The bugs began nipping at Ford with their insectoid claws and mandibles, ripping a hole in his pants that revealed the Six Days, Seven Nights actor was wearing @ sign pattern underwear. As the viruses closed in, things seemed truly bleak for the cinema legend, until when, in a flash of inspiration, he pulled his cell phone out from his pocket and used the mail app to attach a file called “Harrison.ford,” uploading himself to the cloud. This caused Ford to disintegrate into a cloud of millions of electrified particles, which shot up into outer space and bounced between communication satellites in orbit at the speed of light. After zooming around the world and ricocheting off Sputnik, Ford transformed into a lightning bolt and flew down at a radio antennae, then sped through telephone cables until he arrived back at his own computer and his inkjet printer spit him out as a black-and-white picture on an 8.5 x 11 sheet of paper. An ambulance rushed the piece of paper that is Harrison Ford to the hospital, where the actor is currently on bed rest. A tweet from Ford’s son shows that the Han Solo performer is in good spirits and on the mend despite his ordeal inside the internet: Here’s wishing Harrison Ford a speedy recovery! We’re glad he survived his near-death experience inside his computer and hope he gets well soon!"
Shocking Statistic: The Average American Is Ingesting More Than 8 Pounds Of Spiders Right This Second,N/A,https://clickhole.com/shocking-statistic-the-average-american-is-ingesting-m-1832834389/,"This is one of those stunning factoids that, no matter how many times you hear it, is just a little bit freaky: Statistics suggest that the average American is ingesting more than 8 pounds of spiders right this second. If you’re a little creeped out, you’re not alone! You might think the idea that anyone would ever swallow a spider is ridiculous, but the fact is that on average, Americans have more than 100 ounces of spiders parading down their gullets as you read this sentence. Of course, 8 pounds is only the statistical mean—there are surely some people who are only eating one or two spiders at the moment while others are downing a dump truck’s worth. So weird, right? We bet you’re wondering how many pounds of spiders you’re eating right now! The good news is that this phenomenon is totally normal and not dangerous—of the thousands of spiders currently stampeding into the typical American’s mouth, most are not poisonous, and may even provide several pounds of protein when ingested!  Well, we hope this article taught you a little something! Send it along to a friend to let them know just how many spiders they’re eating right now!"
"Privacy Scandal: Mark Zuckerberg Is Being Chased By
A Shotgun-Toting Farmer After Ignoring The Old Man’s Rule Not To Collect His
Beautiful Daughter’s Personal Data",N/A,https://clickhole.com/privacy-scandal-mark-zuckerberg-is-being-chased-by-a-s-1832473710/,"Mark Zuckerberg has weathered his share of controversy, but his latest privacy scandal is the worst he’s suffered yet. The Facebook CEO is currently running away from a shotgun-toting farmer after breaking the old man’s rule not to collect his beautiful daughter’s personal data. Yikes, this spells trouble for Facebook. Although he’s managed to avoid consequences for vacuuming up user data in the past, it looks like Zuckerberg has finally crossed the line as he sprints across a wheat field ducking rounds of buckshot.  Zuckerberg chanced across the farmer’s cottage when his car broke down while he was driving home late one night from Facebook’s headquarters. After knocking on Old Man Clemson’s front door, the aging farmer generously offered him a place to sleep for the night, with one strict stipulation: “Mr. Zuckerberg, you’re welcome to my hospitality, but keep your distance from my daughter Gwendoline’s data,” warned the farmer. “You avoid assembling a user profile about her online browsing habits, and we’ll all get along just fine.”  At first, Zuckerberg tried to obey his host’s intimidating threat despite being sorely tempted by all the targeted ad dollars he could earn from sweet Gwendoline’s highly desirable demographic. Over a dinner of suckling pig, the Facebook CEO won the trust of the farmer and his wife by complimenting their cooking and bonded with them by discussing his fun hobby of personally slaughtering the animals he eats. But trouble started when the farmer’s daughter changed the subject to Zuckerberg’s line of work.  “I heard you Menlo Park boys work wonders when it comes to monitoring people across the web, even when they aren’t on Facebook,” the girl said coquettishly while twirling a blonde lock of hair around her finger. “None of the gents in this boring backwater town are sophisticated enough to use the ‘like’ buttons that are embedded on websites everywhere to secretly relay your IP address back to a Facebook server whether or not you click anything,” she said, clearly enamored with the hoodie-wearing CEO. Noticing the farmer’s suspicious glare, Zuckerberg quickly began talking about how Facebook values and respects user privacy, repeating the same lines he’d memorized for his congressional testimony after the Cambridge Analytica scandal. When dinner was over, the farmer pulled Zuckerberg aside and growled “I see the goo-goo eyes you’re making for my daughter’s data, and I won’t abide that under my roof. If you and my little girl decide to have sex with each other, that’s your business. I respect her bodily autonomy, and she can sleep with whomever she chooses at any time, but I won’t tolerate a business model that monetizes users by trading their information to shady marketing firms and political super PACs under my roof.” After once again assuring the farmer of his honest intentions, Zuckerberg went to sleep in an upstairs guest room only to be awakened around midnight by the sound of the door creaking open. Standing in the doorway was Gwendoline, her lace nighty glimmering silver in the moonlight from an open window. “Sorry to bother you, Mr. Zuckerberg, but I couldn’t sleep on account of how valuable my ad impressions are for corporate brands,” she tittered lasciviously. “Would it be all right if I sat next to you in bed and filled out a few Facebook user surveys?”  After hissing at her to close the door, Zuckerberg nervously began collecting her data. “This is wrong, you’re only 16…” he muttered before succumbing to temptation and gathering the email addresses of her contacts. The next morning, Old Man Clemson was browsing his Facebook notifications when he got a message from the social media platform suggesting he tag his daughter in a vacation photo. “Zuckerberg! You uploaded my precious Gwendoline to your facial recognition algorithm!” he bellowed as he stormed upstairs, unaware that Zuckerberg had already shimmied down a drainpipe to make a hasty exit. “Maude, fetch my Winchester!”  Pushing past his daughter, who begged him, “Don’t hurt Mark Zuckerberg, Papa! I love Facebook!” the farmer began chasing the tech mogul across the pasture with a speed surprising for his advanced age. As Zuckerberg rounded the front gate, the farmer unleashed a double-barreled blast from his shotgun that narrowly missed the fleeing billionaire and instead blew apart his own mailbox in a shower of shrapnel and envelopes. “This is the final straw, Zuckerberg! I’m quitting Facebook once and for all!” screamed the farmer as he reloaded his firearm. “From now on, I’m only posting pics of my daughter on Instagram!” As of the latest reports, the chase shows no signs of slowing down, which definitely isn’t good for Facebook’s public image. Having an outraged, shotgun-wielding farmer in hot pursuit of Mark Zuckerberg is not a great look for a company that’s trying to win back users’ trust on privacy issues. It’s clear that when it comes to how Facebook collects data from Old Man Clemson’s daughter, the social media giant still has room for improvement. "
Beautiful: Jerry Stiller Called This Terminally Ill Child At 3 A.M. Last Night To Tell Her An Idea He Had For A New Type Of Sushi Roll,N/A,https://clickhole.com/beautiful-jerry-stiller-called-this-terminally-ill-chi-1832559758/,"Add Jerry Stiller to our list of coolest celebrities in Hollywood, because he just committed an act of kindness that will take your breath away: The extremely generous actor took time out of his busy schedule to call a terminally ill child in the middle of the night to tell her an idea for a new type of sushi roll he’d invented! This is so beautiful! What a heartwarming surprise for this little girl! Completely bedridden at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital, 7-year-old Shelly Paterson had the experience of a lifetime one incredible night at 3 a.m. She was jolted awake by the phone ringing in her hospital room, and when she answered, it was none other than Jerry Stiller on the other end of the line, who briefly said “Hi” before launching into a description of a sushi roll that “wasn’t like anything you see at the buffets.” “It’s got that orange mayonnaise on it, but instead of fish, it’s got crispy, fried turkey strips,” Stiller continued. “Are you listening, because I’m about to get to the good part: Artichoke hearts.” You can only imagine the look on Shelly’s face for the next 20 minutes as Jerry Stiller continued breaking down his idea for a new kind of sushi roll. We don’t blame you if you’ve got to bust out the tissues after reading this one! Jerry then said he’d changed his mind about the turkey but that “it has some sort of crispy meat that’s not fish, I’ll figure it out,” and that the roll wasn’t too spicy and it didn’t have “sesame nuts” or “that seaweed crap” on it. He even shared some possible names for the roll with Shelly, which included “The Japanese Delight,” “Mr. Tso’s Delight,” and “The Sushi Lover’s Delight,” before abruptly hanging up, leaving Shelly with an amazing experience that will hopefully make her days in the hospital a little easier! There’s no doubt that hearing about Jerry Stiller’s idea for a sushi roll must have been the coolest middle-of-the-night call Shelly ever received. Acts like this which help make life bearable for sick kids deserve all the applause. More of this, please!"
"Encouraging Teamwork: ‘Apex Legends’ Has A Button
That Lets Players Easily Announce They Have Diarrhea And Won’t Be Shooting
Anyone For A Few Minutes ",N/A,https://clickhole.com/encouraging-teamwork-apex-legends-has-a-button-that-1832737159/,"Apex Legends has quickly become the hottest new battle royale game on the market, and one of its best features is an innovative ping system that makes communication a breeze. Teamwork is easy in Apex Legends because the game has a button to announce you have diarrhea and will be too busy sitting on your toilet to shoot anyone for a few minutes. Game developer Respawn Entertainment deserves a round of applause for making it so convenient to let your teammates know you have a bathroom problem and they can’t rely on you for a while! With one press of the diarrhea button, your character will shout a context-sensitive message like “about to lose control of my bowels” or “heading to the restroom for a lengthy stay because of an emergency.” A brown toilet icon will then flag your avatar as inactive, and they’ll perform a character-specific emote like clutching their stomach in gastrointestinal distress, allowing other players to tell at a glance that you’ve run to the toilet and won’t be participating in combat for the foreseeable future. The innovative diarrhea signaling system Respawn Entertainment has come up with is so effortless that it’s actually superior to using a microphone. In the time it takes to say a clunky sentence like, “Hey team, I have diarrhea and will be on the toilet for at least 10 minutes and probably much longer, so I won’t be able to help out our team with my gun because I’ll be evacuating my bowels instead,” you could instead have instantly hit one button and already be frantically unbuckling your pants as you run towards the bathroom. The time saved by using a diarrhea ping could mean the difference between successfully reaching the toilet or shitting your pants, which gives Apex Legends a serious advantage over other battle royale games like Fortnite or PUBG, which require you to give your teammates a lengthy verbal warning that you’re about to have diarrhea.  Then, when the diarrhea stops, you can jump right back into combat by either erasing the diarrhea ping or replacing it with the “more diarrhea soon” ping, which indicates that your toilet ordeal is far from over, but you have a few seconds away from the bathroom to help out your team before the next wave hits you. If you haven’t played Apex Legends and gotten diarrhea mid-match, you’re missing out on the best communication system in multiplayer. Let’s hope other battle royale games copy this feature and make Apex Legend’s diarrhea ping an industry standard!"
"Fighting Harassment: Twitter Will Now Only Allow Users To Tweet, ‘Die, Bitch’ To Bitches Who Should Die",N/A,https://clickhole.com/fighting-harassment-twitter-will-now-only-allow-users-1832469383/,"Twitter has long been under fire by users who feel that its management does not do enough to deal with the verbal harassment and abuse that often runs rampant on the site, but the social networking giant just announced a new policy that may just change things for the better: Twitter will now only allow users to tweet “Die, bitch” to bitches who should die. Finally! This is a step in the right direction toward ensuring that Twitter users are all treated with the respect they deserve. “It is our mission at Twitter to make sure that our users are not exposed to unsubstantiated, hateful speech, like when someone tweets ‘die, bitch’ at a bitch who does not genuinely need to log off and kill herself,” explained CEO Jack Dorsey in a press conference about the new policy. “We are committed to ensuring that the only dumb bitches who are told to go choke or drown are the ones who actually deserve to do those things due to being stupid whores who run their mouths too much. Any bitch who hasn’t stepped out of her place and does not actually need to drop dead should absolutely not be subjected to messages about how she ought to be six feet under—that’s not what Twitter is about.” Thank you, Twitter! This is the kind of common sense reform we need from our social networks! Dorsey further explained that under the new policy, users will be able to flag messages like “die, bitch” as inaccurate. The messages will then be reviewed by a content monitoring team who will determine whether the cunt in question is actually the type of person who would make the world a better place by just fucking dying. If not, the user who posted the message may face having their account suspended or even being permanently banned from Twitter, depending on how far off the mark they were when they suggested that people as stupid as the bitch they’re tweeting at should be forcibly euthanized. This is fantastic. With this new policy in place, users are going to feel so much safer when they post on Twitter. Here’s to open, honest, and respectful discourse on the internet!"
Girl Power! American Girl Has Released A New Doll Who Was Alive During The Civil Rights Movement But Didn’t Really Help At All,N/A,https://clickhole.com/girl-power-american-girl-has-released-a-new-doll-who-w-1832277584/,"American Girl has long offered an amazing line of inspiring, spunky dolls that help teach young girls about women’s first-hand experiences with American history, and this new addition to their lineup is set to continue that tradition in the most amazing way possible: American Girl just released a new doll who was alive during the Civil Rights movement but didn’t really help at all. Awesome! This is a perfect way for kids to learn about the thousands of girls and women who were kind of peripherally aware of what was going on with African Americans’ fight for equal rights, but didn’t exactly jump into the fray themselves. The new doll is named Karen Holliday, and, according to American Girl’s promotional materials, she’s an ordinary girl living in Birmingham, AL in the late 1950s, where she loves climbing trees, playing first base for her school’s softball team, and thinking about how the Civil Rights Movement seems like a big deal but isn’t the kind of thing she would ever personally be involved in. One American Girl rep described Karen as a kind, spirited girl who has no problem with the fact that her school might be integrated in the coming years, but isn’t going to take to the streets to campaign for it, either. How exciting. Girls everywhere are probably already begging their parents for this super-cool Karen doll, which even comes with a journal where she mentions that the Montgomery bus boycott was “very interesting” before moving on to detail the kind of dress she wants to buy for the big dance at school. The Karen doll also offers other awesome accessories that bring alive what it was like to be a girl during one of the most pivotal times in American history and pretty much let it go over your head in favor of focusing on your own life. Her full set includes a newspaper with a front page story about Rosa Parks that she cut out in order to save a story about a local animal shelter from the other side of the page, plus a trophy that her softball team won in their all-white youth league. Wow. What an incredible way for kids to learn about history! This Karen Holliday doll is likely to become an instant classic. Many girls are sure to relate to her story of being around but not really doing a ton during a critical point for minorities in America. American Girl FTW!"

"A Sponsored Content Deal Fell Through After We Already Did The Work, So Enjoy These Brandless Pictures Of People Happy About A Blue Liquid",N/A,https://clickhole.com/a-sponsored-content-deal-fell-through-after-we-already-1832135505/,"The company we were working with pulled out of our sponsored content deal at the last second, but it seems like a shame to let all these graphics we worked on go to waste—so please enjoy these brandless pictures of people happy about a blue liquid. There’s no point in telling you why these people are so happy over the blue liquid now, but we have the photo ready to go, so why not post it? If you knew the context, you’d know why this picture would make such awesome sponsored content for the company we were working with, but unfortunately, they decided at the last minute that they didn’t like the creative direction we were headed in. Anyways, here it is with no branding whatsoever. Figured we’d get some use out of it. This branded list was going to be a big payday for us, but sometimes when it comes to correspondence between a business’ marketing team and our creative team, things just don’t quite line up. We still thought this graphic was pretty neat. The image here makes a lot of sense when you know the company name and the product associated with it, but since that’s not happening, feel free to imagine whatever you want about this blue liquid! Detergent, sports drink, whatever. There’s no point in dwelling on what went wrong with our ad deal—we’d rather you enjoy these blue liquid pics! Honestly, if you own a company that makes a blue liquid, at this point we’d have no problem slapping your name on this list for a little dough. The original ask was $250 K, but we’d be willing to drop it pretty significantly. These blue liquid photos are pretty much up for grabs. However many unique impressions you want on it, we can make that happen. We won’t name names, but you’d be getting an entire sponsored content deal originally intended for a pretty big, successful corporation. Just something to think about. We put some good effort into this graphic—not that it was rocket science or anything, pretty simple stuff—just thought you might like to take a look is all. Maybe if you see a blue liquid in stores, you’ll be more likely to buy it now. Boy, the company who dropped out of the deal would be kicking themselves if that happened! Who knows though. Doesn’t matter at this point since we’re not beholden to anybody but ourselves on this one. Anyways, enjoy the photo! This is a pretty nice photo to look at regardless of whether it’s backed by a brand or not, so even though it would’ve been pretty cool for us to get that sponsorship deal, it’s a win for you either way. Oh well! Blue liquid FTW!"
Inspiring: This Awesome Non-Profit Works To Overturn The Convictions Of Prisoners Who Don’t Like Being In Prison,N/A,https://clickhole.com/inspiring-this-awesome-non-profit-works-to-overturn-th-1832359096/,"It’s no secret that the United States’ justice system is inhumane, unsustainable, and in serious need of an overhaul. But until then, one awesome non-profit is stepping up in a major way by working to overturn the convictions of prisoners who don’t like being in prison. The group, which is called Operation Fresh Air, employs a team of dozens of lawyers and legal advocates whose mission is to fight for inmates who are scared or bored of living in prison. The amazing difference Operation Fresh Air is having on the world is perhaps best highlighted by the case of Michael Terrell, who faced a life sentence for double homicide, but was contacted by OFA when they learned that he hated living in prison because the food wasn’t as good as at home, he was surrounded by violent criminals, and he had to stay locked in drab cell for much of the day. OFA sent a legal team to meet with Michael, and after learning that he also didn’t like wearing a prison jumpsuit and much preferred the jeans and T-shirts that he was allowed to wear outside of prison, they began putting together an official appeal that would overturn Michael’s conviction and win his freedom. Over the next 18 months, OFA’s team worked on Michael’s case around the clock and on July 8, 2018—13 years into his life sentence—Michael walked out of the prison whose bad smell and cold floors he disliked so much, a free man once again. Absolutely beautiful. The work Operation Fresh Air is doing is so, so important. Sadly, Michael’s case is not unusual. “We estimate that as many as 25 percent of convicted prisoners in the U.S. hate being stuck in prison and would like to go back to being free,” said Cheryl Affenti, director of Operation Fresh Air. “The shocking reality is that there are hundreds of thousands of people in the American carceral system who enjoy spending their time however they want and living in comfortable houses with their families much more than being forced to follow the strict schedule and mundane lifestyle mandated inside of prison.” Wow. While it’s disheartening to come to terms with the fact that the U.S. currently has countless convicted prisoners sitting behind bars who would much rather be able to up and go to the beach any time they want, it’s heartening to know that OFA is on their side and working to see them live where it’s fun once again. In fact, in just four years, they’ve already overturned the convictions of more than 75 inmates who were having a terrible time living in prison, including a dozen who were on death row. Here’s hoping that number only continues to grow!"
A Titan Of Sport: This Man At The Gym Is All-Out Sprinting On The Treadmill In Cargo Shorts While Watching Old Episodes Of ‘River Monsters’ On A Microsoft Surface Tablet,N/A,https://clickhole.com/a-titan-of-sport-this-man-at-the-gym-is-all-out-sprint-1832278479/,"Open your eyes and bear witness to a display of athleticism unmatched even by the most elite Olympians in all of history: This man at the gym is all-out sprinting on the treadmill in cargo shorts while watching old episodes of River Monsters on a Microsoft Surface tablet. Feast your eyes because a true titan of sport like this one only comes around once every few centuries.  Unlike the other gym patrons who are patiently filing into the locker room to change into their pathetic workout clothes, this man walked full-speed into this Planet Fitness and hopped up onto a treadmill in his cargo shorts without even stopping to take off his backpack. He then wasted no time turning the treadmill up to its highest, 12-mile-per-hour setting and began to run at a powerful full sprint that is making the entire machine shake with every thunderous step of his Converse-clad feet. It seems the only thing bolstering his spirit as he makes this Herculean effort is the 2010 episode of River Monsters playing on the Microsoft Surface which he is periodically turning the volume up on while he continues at his breakneck pace. Incredible. Though this man has already broken into a full-body sweat just 45 seconds into his workout, he is still managing to find the strength to periodically grunt “Hiya!” as he sprints. In an amazing show of athletic prowess, this peerless runner is stopping once a minute to smash the treadmill’s stop button with the full force of his palm and bend over to pant with his hands on his knees for a good 30 seconds—never removing the enormous over-the-ear headphones connected to the tablet blasting a River Monsters segment about catfish. The blue button-down shirt he’s wearing is now completely soaked through, but that hasn’t deterred the colossus of exercise from doing two slow burpees on the stopped treadmill, then fast-forwarding all the way to the River Monsters credits as he gradually adjusts the machine to an almost 90-degree incline. Sorry, Lebron! You might have thought you were the greatest athlete of our generation, but there’s a new king in town! Now that this incredible man has seemingly finished his 17-minute workout, he has immediately begun eating from a bag of Nacho Cheese Doritos as he cools down on the treadmill at a one-mile-per-hour pace. We could all look to him for inspiration on our quests to become fit because this man is athleticism incarnate!"
"Caving To Blackmail: Jeff Bezos
Has Shut Down ‘The Washington Post’ After ‘The National Enquirer’ Threatened To
Publish Photos Revealing He’s Bald",N/A,https://clickhole.com/caving-to-blackmail-jeff-bezos-has-shut-down-the-wash-1832539778/,"Last week, Jeff Bezos bravely stood up to The National Enquirer, publicly announcing that the tabloid tried to blackmail him with nude photos. However, today, the Amazon founder is singing a different tune and has shut down The Washington Post entirely after The National Enquirer threatened to publish pictures revealing that Jeff Bezos is bald.  Yep. The National Enquirer just blackmailed Jeff Bezos into shuttering a Pulitzer-winning newspaper. It looks like even a man as rich as Jeff Bezos isn’t invulnerable to coercion. Early this morning, Bezos reportedly received an email from a representative of The National Enquirer informing him that they had received photographic evidence that he suffers from male-pattern baldness and has no hair growing out of his scalp. The National Enquirer told Bezos that they would release these photographs, revealing his baldness to the world, unless he agreed to close down The Washington Post. Within minutes of receiving this email, Bezos fired every employee of The Washington Post so that the paper could no longer publish stories critical of the Trump administration or the Saudi government, which both have ties to The National Enquirer’s corporate owner, AMI. Here’s an excerpt of the “Medium” blog post Bezos wrote to explain the threats he faced from AMI and their CEO, David Pecker:  Toward the end of his blog post, Bezos goes on to explain that while he felt comfortable risking his dick pic going public, that was only because he isn’t ashamed of having a penis, and he is very embarrassed about being bald. He says he believes that if photos of his baldness were made public, his children would abandon him, and he would be ousted as the CEO of Amazon. It’s a tragedy for journalism that the venerated Washington Post has been shut down, but The National Enquirer made Jeff Bezos an offer he couldn’t refuse. It looks like David Pecker and AMI have won this round, and their blackmail has left the Amazon CEO too terrified to do anything that could result in his bald head being exposed to the world."
Unconstitutional Presidency: The Constitution Clearly States That It Is Illegal For A Dumb Orange Man To Be President,N/A,https://clickhole.com/unconstitutional-presidency-the-constitution-clearly-s-1832331926/,"America continues to suffer the national embarrassment that is Donald Trump, but according to law, he shouldn’t even be allowed to sit in the Oval Office. Unfortunately, Mr. Trump, the U.S. Constitution clearly states that it is illegal for a dumb, orange man to be president. The No Dumb Orange Presidents clause of the Constitution couldn’t be more explicit. It says it in plain English in our nation’s founding document:  “Whoever shall hold the office of President, and preside over these United States as its Chief Executive, must not be a dumb, orange man.” Anyone who reads those words our Founding Fathers wrote over two centuries ago will see it’s obvious that Trump should have been disqualified from day one. The law of the land is clear as day. If you are a dumb, orange man, you can’t be president. Unfortunately, the GOP is letting Trump flagrantly defy this sacred statute. If that wasn’t bad enough, the Trump administration also violates the constitutional requirement against fat dopes with bad hair. Article 2, Section 4 of the Constitution clearly states: “Under no circumstances shall the President be a Rotund Dope with Bad Blonde Hair, a plump imbecile who is in such poor physical condition he can only play the Leisurely Pastime of Golf. Furthermore, his fingers must be large or average sized, and not miniature little stubs, akin to a Toddler’s Fingers, indicating that his Penis is similarly lacking in stature.” Yeah, you don’t have to be a lawyer to see that a Trump presidency is sorely at odds with the vision our founding fathers had for America. In a functional democracy, Trump would have never been allowed to run.  Sadly, the GOP continues to put party ahead of country and tolerate a dumb, orange man as commander in chief. Republicans need to grow a conscience and listen to the advice George Washington gave in his 1796 farewell speech: “If a dumb, orange man is president, it’s time to impeach.”"
A Love That Transcends Time And Space: This Elderly Couple Died Within 8 Years Of Each Other,N/A,https://clickhole.com/a-love-that-transcends-time-and-space-this-elderly-cou-1832279193/,"Brace yourself, because here comes a story that will make you believe in the amazing, transcendent power of true love: This elderly couple died within eight years of each other. So powerful. “Romantic” barely begins to describe the passion that these two must have shared. Jeanne and Douglas Flath, two high-school sweethearts who got married after graduating in 1952, were coming up on their 58th anniversary when Douglas suddenly passed away from pneumonia at age 76. Amazingly, later that very same decade, Jeanne died in peacefully in her sleep at home at age 84. To see that these two people were so deeply in love that Jeanne couldn’t bear to be apart from Douglas for more than eight years is simply just too moving for words. The icing on the cake? Jeanne and Douglas are buried in the exact same state. “After my grandfather passed, my grandmother could hardly go three months without mentioning him,” remarked Kara Flath, Jeanne and Douglas’ granddaughter. “The fact that she only got married one other time after he was gone, I mean, it’s like something straight out of a romantic movie—but they really lived it.” Talk about everlasting love! It is truly as if this couple shared one soul. Ugh, we’re totally ugly-crying right now. There are relationship goals, and then there is love like this. If this doesn’t melt your heart, we honestly don’t know if anything will! RIP together forever, Jeanne and Douglas!"
Seems Extreme: Jacob Farted During Math And The Marines Wheeled Him Out Of The Classroom In One Of Those Hannibal Lecter Straitjacket Things With The Muzzle,N/A,https://clickhole.com/seems-extreme-jacob-farted-during-math-and-the-marines-1832161822/,"A serious situation is currently unfolding in Mrs. Shaffer’s algebra 1 class, and as more details emerge, it’s becoming pretty tough to view the whole thing as anything other than a massive overreaction: Jacob farted during math and the Marines immediately busted in to wheel him out of the classroom in one of those Hannibal Lecter straitjackets with the muzzle and everything. Damn. If all the kid did was fart, the whole thing definitely feels kind of extreme. Everything was business as usual in Mrs. Shaffer’s math class this afternoon until Jacob let loose a small, but audible fart as he bent down from his chair to grab something from his backpack. Before the mortified student could even move his sneakers around on the floor to make people think maybe the fart sound was actually just a shoe-scuffing sound, and before his classmates could even register the noise enough to laugh at the innocent mistake, several armed Marines were already bursting through the classroom windows, sending shards of glass flying all over the shocked and screaming students whose desks sat along the wall as they repelled down to the floor. “Move, move, move!” roared a Marine who’d somersaulted toward the teacher’s desk and begun scanning his semi-automatic weapon across the room of shrieking children just as a battering ram pulverized the classroom door in a single blow, making way for a dozen more battle-ready Marines to pile inside and establish a 360-degree perimeter. “Snatch that farting little motherfucker and go!” The special ops soldiers reportedly wasted no time in tackling Jacob clean out of his chair, pinning him to the floor and repeatedly tasing his neck and ribs until he was rendered completely defenseless, all while the rest of the terrorized class watched on in total horror. It was then that a writhing and wriggling Jacob, who had only moments earlier let his tight, creaky fart pass, was picked up off the classroom floor in a headlock while five or six Marines wrestled his squirming arms and legs into one of those insane-looking straitjacket things that they put Hannibal Lecter in in Silence Of The Lambs, with one of those crazy muzzles and everything! It definitely doesn’t seem fair that Jacob’s punishment for farting just one time is to be wheeled out of the room in a full-body restraint as he loudly begs for help that will never come. Last anyone saw of Jacob, he was being loaded onto an Apache helicopter that lifted off from the school parking lot and disappeared over the horizon. Poor kid. No matter how you look at it, it feels like everyone went a bit overboard on this one. For someone who did nothing but rip one little fart, Jacob’s really been through a major ordeal. Here’s to hoping that Mrs. Shaffer’s algebra class can get back on track after this whole mess, and that Jacob is eventually released from the black site where he’s being detained sometime soon!"

Grim Prognosis: Researchers Have Determined That Penguins Will Look Incredibly Stupid When They’re Dying From Global Warming ,N/A,https://clickhole.com/grim-prognosis-researchers-have-determined-that-pengui-1831883047/,"The effects of global warming are becoming alarmingly clear more and more each day, but the latest finding by scientists at UCLA could prove to be the most worrying yet: According to their research, penguins will look incredibly stupid when they’re dying from global warming. This is a truly grim prognosis for the future of our planet’s wildlife. Penguins are going to look like complete doofuses as they go extinct, and it may already be too late to help them. The study, published in this month’s Journal Of Science, reports that as rising global temperatures continue to shrink the Antarctic ice sheet, penguins will inevitably make complete dumbasses of themselves as they begin to slip around in the thawed-out mud and fall beak-first onto the soggy ground. The report speculates that by 2035, as much as 93% of the current penguin population will resemble slapstick characters straight out of vaudeville as they wobble and face-plant all over the iceless bedrock of the thawing Antarctic continent. “Tragically, if climate change continues unimpeded, then within the next two decades we expect to see penguins crashing through thinning ice and bellyflopping into the ocean like Wile E. Coyote or something,” says the report. “We are already seeing a depletion in the fish populations that penguins feed on, and by extrapolating their rate of decline, it’s clear that penguins are going to be eating any soda can or pair of underwear that washes ashore as global warming continues to humiliate these incredible animals and renders them extinct.” Wow. This is truly devastating. Mankind’s carelessness with the environment will undeniably spell a hard-to-watch, hilarious end for these incredible creatures unless something is done immediately."
Mad With Power: A Cackling Jimmy Fallon Gloated To Viewers Last Night That He Held A ‘Scrubs’ Reunion Without Anybody Around Just For His Own Personal Amusement ,N/A,https://clickhole.com/mad-with-power-a-cackling-jimmy-fallon-gloated-to-view-1831951926/,"None It seems like one of late night’s most celebrated hosts may have let his fame and fortune go straight to his head: Last night, a cackling Jimmy Fallon gloated to viewers that he held a Scrubs reunion without anybody around just for his own personal amusement. Jesus Christ. Jimmy Fallon has become completely corrupted by power. Now we are all just pawns in his cruel little games. Shortly after completing a string of monologue jokes at the top of his show, a sneering Fallon looked out at the studio audience and asked, “So, are there any Scrubs fans in the audience tonight?” Crowd members began to cheer as a visibly giddy Fallon began rubbing his hands together and said, “Well, I have some news for you: Last night, I had the entire cast of Scrubs over to my place for a reunion, and none of you will ever, ever see it.” Fallon then erupted into delirious laughter as the audience looked on in confusion. “That’s right! It was all for me! All for me!” the Tonight Show host crowed maniacally, his eyes wide and a vicious grin plastered on his face, “J.D., Turk, Elliot, Dr. Cox, even the janitor—they all came alive once again just for my own personal thrill, and the only person on this Earth who was around to see it was me, only me!” The audience, now in stunned silence, watched as a tyrannical Fallon paraded around the stage, cackling with delight while cruelly regaling viewers with a few details about the heartwarming Scrubs reunion no one will ever see. It sounds like after a few years of hosting The Tonight Show, Jimmy Fallon has become a full-blown supervillain. Throughout the Tonight Show taping, Fallon continued to shriek with laughter as he recounted how the entire cast of Scrubs  sat in his living room for the first time in years, reminiscing about the best moments from the beloved sitcom and sharing adorable behind-the-scenes anecdotes, all of which Fallon recorded on his phone and then immediately deleted without uploading even a second to YouTube. Fallon concluded his horrific tirade by gleefully admitting he doesn’t even like Scrubs that much, and has only seen a couple episodes here and there. “I guess I’ll have to check out more of the show now that I’ve reunited the entire cast for the one and only time ever, but probably not,” the host said before stepping offstage amid uproarious boos from the audience, ending the show before any of the planned guests or musical segments.  Wow. It’s always a shame to see a popular celebrity transform into a sadistic tyrant, but Fallon seems to be relishing his new role. Let’s hope Jimmy changes his ways in the future and uses his power for good and not for evil."
Benefits Of Streaming: The Number Of Fatal Car Accidents Caused By People Rushing To Get Home To Watch ‘Frasier’ Has Decreased By 80% Over The Last Decade,N/A,https://clickhole.com/benefits-of-streaming-the-number-of-fatal-car-accident-1831743640/,"Streaming movies and TV has undeniably made our lives a lot more convenient, and you’ll be happy to learn that it’s actually making the world a lot safer, too. It always seemed like just a sad fact of life that drivers speeding back to their homes to watch a rerun of the hit NBC sitcom Frasier would cause several hundred thousand fatalities in America every year, but with the advent of digital streaming services, the number of fatal car accidents caused by people rushing to get home to watch Frasier has decreased by 80 percent over the last decade. It’s amazing how technology can solve the problems we all assumed we’d just have to live with forever! Thanks to streaming services like Netflix and Hulu, drivers who would normally be blowing through red lights and recklessly skidding around blind corners to catch Frasier’s opening jingle and pithy title cards are now driving safely and carefully obeying traffic laws, all because streaming has given them the freedom to start an episode of Frasier at their own pace. Sure, there are still going to be a handful of drivers who die in their mad dash to get home for the Hallmark channel’s 3 a.m. Frasier block, but thousands who would have otherwise met their fate in a fiery wreck have been able to come home safe to their families and an instantly accessible library of Frasier episodes that they can access as soon as they get home from work. To put this dramatic increase in road safety into perspective, in 1996, over 250,000 pedestrians were struck and killed at crosswalks by drivers barreling past stop signs in their hurry to enjoy Frasier’s clever repartee with his working-class father and Niles’ “will they or won’t they” romance with Daphne. In the past year, only 45,000 pedestrians were killed in Frasier-related collisions!  The impact of streaming on the wellbeing of the American public cannot be overstated. These platforms are bringing our roads into a brighter, safer future. Kudos to all the companies that made this possible by offering Frasier on demand, and keep up the good work!"
Competition For 23AndMe? This New Company Lets You Send Them Your Saliva And They Will Tell You If They Like It,N/A,https://clickhole.com/competition-for-23andme-this-new-company-lets-you-send-1830181686/,"It’s no shock that 23AndMe’s meteoric rise has inspired competitors to enter the biotech industry, but one service in particular might be poised to give the genealogy giant a true run for their money: This new company lets you send them your saliva, and they will tell you if they like it.  Look out, 23AndMe! Only time will tell if the market is big enough for these two innovative companies. The company, which is called SalivApproval, has developed an ingenious method for providing users with feedback on their biomatter. Here’s how it works: Users mail SalivApproval a tupperware container, sandwich baggie, or a plastic soda bottle filled with their saliva along with the $250 enrollment fee. The spit sample then spends 16 weeks inside SalivApproval’s state-of-the-art facilities in Mountain View, CA where it undergoes rigorous personal judgement by the company’s 150-person staff. Once their team reaches a consensus on a user’s saliva, customers receive a large manila envelope containing the results of SalivApproval’s analysis in the form of a letter reading either “We like it” followed by a multi-page explanation of just how much they enjoyed your saliva, or a simpler evaluation like “We don’t like it” or “Not for us.” Then, the only step left in the process is to either accept that SalivApproval is not a fan of your saliva, or to send in more saliva at the company’s request because they like it so much. Whoa. Has 23AndMe totally blown it by failing to let customers know whether they like their spit? Without a doubt, SalivApproval just upped the ante in the biotechnology industry. We’ve got to imagine its competitors are scrambling to avoid falling behind, so don’t be surprised if 23AndMe rolls out a similar service once this takes off. All we know for sure is that we cannot wait to try this out."
"Inclusivity Win! Marvel Is Changing The Sound
That Spider-Man’s Web Shooters Make From ‘Thwip’ To ‘Mixed-Race Families’",N/A,https://clickhole.com/inclusivity-win-marvel-is-changing-the-sound-that-spid-1831881847/,"Marvel just announced they’re taking a huge step forward for representation in comics, and it’s guaranteed to make you stand up and cheer. From now on, the sound effect for Spider-Man’s iconic web shooters will be changed from “thwip” to “mixed-race families.”  Way to go, Marvel! Instead of making a meaningless noise like “thwip,” Spider-Man’s web shooters will be standing up for people to love whoever they want, regardless of race! “Spider-Man protects all New Yorkers, no matter their skin color or who they marry, and it’s time the noise his web shooters make reflected that,” wrote Marvel in a statement on their website this morning that also noted that in all future Marvel films featuring Spider-Man, the sound of his web shooters will be replaced with a British man’s voice saying the words “mixed-race families” out loud. “Whether Peter Parker is swinging from skyscrapers or ensnaring bad guys, his web shooters will affirm that it’s good mixed-race families exist.” Evildoers, beware! When villains like Venom or Mysterio hear the sound “mixed-raced families,” they’ll know Spider-Man is on his way. Kudos to Marvel for setting a positive example and taking real strides to make the world a better place! "
Inspiring Determination: This Man Was Stranded At Sea For 151 Days And Survived Almost The Entire Time,N/A,https://clickhole.com/inspiring-determination-this-man-was-stranded-at-sea-f-1831876264/,"This is the kind of story that will make you realize just how powerful the human spirit can be: This man was stranded at sea for 151 days and survived almost the entire time. Incredible! Most people can’t imagine being tough enough to stay alive that long out in the elements, but this inspiring man very nearly did it. Twenty-nine-year-old Devon Waller set out from his home in San Diego for a solo fishing trip on April 15, 2018 expecting to be home by sundown. But when a storm dragged his small sailboat out into open water, he was forced to spend months eating raw fish, drinking rainwater, and attempting to signal for rescue with a dwindling number of flares, never tiring until the moment he died anyway. According to one of Waller’s final journal entries, he used the thought of seeing of his parents and his girlfriend again to keep him going, which worked for almost the whole time he spent adrift in the ocean until it didn’t. Wow. Waller is an amazing example of someone who beat the odds for a good while before not being able to defy them anymore! Though many people might have given up when help didn’t arrive within the first week, Waller found the strength to build a makeshift shelter to shield him from the blazing sunlight, helping him stay alive for a solid while before it proved to be nowhere near enough to save his life. The type of grit it takes to hold on for an entire 151 days totally lost and completely alone is a quality that even Devon didn’t quite have, but he got kind of close! What a remarkable story. It’s amazing what human beings can do when they are pushed to their limits and forced to dig deep in order to make it through, then ultimately pushed too far to continue on. Hopefully, anyone who finds themselves in a similar situation is able to find the strength that Devon briefly found and then was unable to keep up when his body needed it most!"
Sex-Ed Fail: This Texas Public School Has Fired The Goat-Headed Man Who Lures Students Into The Forest To Show Them A PowerPoint About Safe Sex,N/A,https://clickhole.com/sex-ed-fail-this-texas-public-school-has-fired-the-goa-1831469131/,"Brace yourself for some serious face-palming because one backwards-thinking school district in the American South just did a huge disservice to its students by gutting one of their most important programs: This Texas public school has fired the goat-headed man who lures students into the forest to show them a PowerPoint about safe sex. Ugh. This is a huge step in the wrong direction. For many students at Oakwood High, hearing the goat-headed man’s otherworldly flute melodies and being beguiled into following him into a forest glade outfitted with a screen and projector was one of the only chances they had to learn about sex in a healthy and responsible manner. Now, with the goat-man’s firing and likely replacement by an abstinence-focused class, this all but assures that they’ll miss out on many crucial lessons about their bodies when they need them most.  Having students fall into a trance and stumble miles through thick underbrush to watch the goat-man bleat warningly at a PowerPoint slide detailing the inefficacy of the pull-out method managed to reduce the school’s teen pregnancy rate by 35 percent over the last five years, but the school’s administrators clearly don’t know a good thing when they see it. Instead, they’ve decided to deprive these kids of the goat-man and his clip art-heavy sex-ed PowerPoint, a shortsightedness that will have repercussions that reach far beyond the carpet of eerily luminescent wildflowers that blanket the floor of the goat-man’s forest classroom. The saddest part of all is that, in the end, it’s the students who will pay the price.  “It’s a tragedy that Oakwood High’s administration has fired the goat-man because he could make students feel completely at ease learning about things like affirmative consent and STI testing even though his bewitched glade was totally dark during what should have been the middle of the day,” said Rachel Parker, a Planned Parenthood lawyer advocating for comprehensive sex education in Texas schools. “Everything these students know about proper condom application, they learned by waking from a powerful hypnosis deep within the woods and seeing the goat-man demonstrate the correct technique by rolling a Durex over one of his horns while hissing menacingly at a diagram of someone putting one on incorrectly. We cannot overstate how much of a terrible loss it is that future students won’t get to see the goat-man clamber up the gnarled, ancient tree stump he used as a podium and perform a deep bow to a slide explaining how dental dams work.” These kids have got their work cut out for them trying to learn about safe sex without the goat-headed man and his PowerPoint. Here’s hoping the school admins see the light and hire him back because their students just won’t be getting a full education without him!"
Beautiful Cultural Exchange: This German Student Visiting An American High School Shouted ‘My Eggs!’ After He Got Hit In The Testicles With A Football,N/A,https://clickhole.com/beautiful-cultural-exchange-this-german-student-visiti-1830922925/,"Studying abroad can be an invaluable experience in a young person’s education. Luckily for the students at Fanwood High School, their foreign exchange program is a beautiful example of how rewarding it can be for young people to immerse themselves in different cultures: A German exchange student visiting the school just shouted, “My eggs!” after he got nailed in the testicles with a football. Simply amazing. This is what cultural exchange programs are all about! Julius Werber, a “fußball” player back in his Deutschland hometown of Fürstenfeldbruck, had never played “American football” before attending gym class with the student hosting him. Though the local kids expected to spend that period teaching their European guest about the sport, Julius ended up teaching the Americans a little something about his culture, too, when a mis-thrown spiral drilled him in the genitals with a devastatingly audible thump that made him wheeze, “OHH! MY EGGS!” and collapse into fetal position on the grass. The lucky U.S. students gained an invaluable insight into what some Germans believe is normal to yell in English after taking a forceful hit to the groin! The beauty of cultural diversity was on full display as everyone observed Julius clutch his “eggs” while groaning “wee” instead of how people in our country say “ow” and trying not to vomit on the M&M characters T-shirt he’d purchased when his host family took him to Times Square. There are few better emblems of our global community than a good-old American pigskin lying on the ground next to a German teenager screaming a fascinatingly mistranslated malapropism. What an absolutely wonderful cross-cultural moment! Thanks to Julius’s decision to scream, “My eggs!” while clutching his injured testicles, our world just became a little more connected. Living in a different country, even for just a semester, can be overwhelming, but Julius and these American students are living proof that how no matter what our customs are, our differences also have the beautiful power to bring us together!"
Coolest Job Ever: This Awesome Digital Media Company Hired Post Malone To Entertain Laid-Off Employees With Amazing Music While They Cleaned Out Their Desks!,N/A,https://clickhole.com/coolest-job-ever-this-awesome-digital-media-company-hi-1832134099/,"While it often seems like companies care more about making money than their own employees, here’s a heartwarming story that proves that some companies are still putting their workers first in the coolest way possible: This awesome digital media company hired Post Malone to entertain laid-off employees with amazing music while they cleaned out their desks! Okay, this has got to be the coolest workplace ever! Anyone would be lucky to work there. As dozens of people packed up their things after being laid off from their job at a New York-based digital media company earlier this morning, they got the surprise of a lifetime when pop superstar Post Malone appeared in their office kitchen to perform his hit songs live as they put their belongings into cardboard boxes. The awesome millionaires who own the company went out of their way to turn a boring day of mass layoffs into a once-in-a-lifetime musical experience that none of their lucky former employees will ever forget! Toying with the livelihoods of hundreds of employees to appease the whims of a hyper-wealthy board of directors has never looked so trendy! It’s great to see a company go above and beyond like this for their staff. Just think how cool it would be to hear Post Malone spitting his awesome verses as you frantically transfer files from your work email to your personal email before your work account gets permanently shut down! The amazing media conglomerate even had Post Malone close out his 15-minute concert by posing for photos with the people who had managed to pack up their desk quickly enough to have a few spare moments before a security guard escorted them off of the premises. The executives running this company know how to make the workplace hip, and the people they just fired will definitely be bragging to all their friends about how their awesome bosses managed to get the Post Malone to sing for them as they left the office for the last time. Other companies, take note: This is how you treat your employees. Hats off to this incredible company for pulling out all the stops and being the most fun office ever!"

Though the former Trump advisor was only taken into custody earlier today, his less than 24 hours behind bars quickly led to a stunning personal transformation: Roger Stone has already had a religious awakening and converted to Islam in prison. Wow. That didn’t take long at all! According to sources, Stone, who has now adopted the name Abdal Hakim Stone, began to study Islamic scripture in the back of the police vehicle that took him to Fort Lauderdale’s Federal Courthouse immediately after his arrest and officially converted sometime during the three hours he spent in a holding cell prior to appearing before a judge. The infamous political consultant was released on bail for $250,000 and reportedly had a driver take him directly from the courthouse to a nearby mosque in time to participate in the noontime Dhuhr prayer service. Check out Stone’s tweet announcing his extremely swift embrace of Islam below: It’s safe to say that this has been a huge day for Abdal Hakim Stone on several fronts! Though Stone’s future may be uncertain, he now has the guidance of his new religion to help him through whatever troubles may lie ahead. What a huge twist in an already complex case!"
All Done Now: A Team Of Archaeologists Has Discovered A Pile Of Bones Labeled ‘The Last Of The Bones’,N/A,https://clickhole.com/all-done-now-a-team-of-archaeologists-has-discovered-a-1832060824/,"Today is nothing short of historic in the science world because an absolutely groundbreaking discovery has been made by a team of archaeologists working just outside the U.K. town of Whitchurch that, just this morning, unearthed a pile of bones labeled “The Last Of The Bones.” Simply incredible! This will surely be a find that revolutionizes archaeological science going forward. Experts have officially found all the bones! The group of researchers made the landmark discovery while excavating a neolithic-era cave where they uncovered a complete human skeleton dating to approximately 11,000 years ago with the label attached, denoting that these bones were the absolute last bones concealed beneath the earth’s surface and none are left to be discovered. “We’ve managed to determine that this is the skeleton of a healthy female of approximately 35 years of age, and that appears to pretty much wrap up all of our bone digging, based on the label affixed to the right femur when they were excavated,” said Dr. Angel Walsh, the lead researcher on the dig. “We seem to have gotten our hands on all of the skeletons everywhere, so I guess it’s time to pack it in and move on to other things now.” This is truly an amazing day. Walsh and his team can give themselves a big pat on the back and go home proud knowing that they’ve discovered the last of the bones, and the field of archaeology has nothing left to do and no longer needs to exist. Congrats!"

More Dysfunction: The Secret Service Just Accidentally Shot Eric Trump After Catching Him Trying On His Dad’s Swim Trunks And Mistaking Him For An Intruder,N/A,https://clickhole.com/more-dysfunction-the-secret-service-just-accidentally-1831257051/,"It seems like each new day of Donald Trump’s presidency, we hear yet another story of chaos taking place behind the scenes at the White House, and according to sources, today, things have been even more dysfunctional than usual: The Secret Service accidentally shot Eric Trump this morning after catching him trying on his dad’s swim trunks and mistaking him for an intruder. It’s safe to say that the Trump administration is in complete disarray! The incident took place earlier this morning when Secret Service agents heard a suspicious series of thuds and giggles coming from the Presidential Bedroom Suite, and, upon further investigation, discovered a large, nude, unidentified individual staggering around with a pair of the president’s swim trunks over his head, muttering, “I look cool just like daddy,” while simultaneously trying to put on a second pair of the president’s swim trunks. After the suspect failed to heed two verbal warnings from agents and instead staggered towards them trying to give them a hug, the agents subdued him with three gunshots to the abdomen, rendering him incapacitated. Agents then identified the suspect as Eric Trump, who admitted to sneaking past the White House security checkpoint so he could try on his father’s swim attire in secret and make-believe he was “Mr. Big Boss.” “We can confirm that there was indeed a situation at the White House earlier today in which a member of the president’s immediate family was critically wounded by gunfire while trying on a pair of the president’s swim trunks,” said White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders in a brief prepared statement. “Such incidents are perfectly normal during a presidency, and, despite what the mainstream media would have you believe, there is absolutely no cause for alarm. Everything is going very smoothly at the White House, and what happened today will only help make America stronger.” President Trump himself also downplayed the incident, tweeting that “jobs are up” since Eric was shot and that “many people are thanking me.” He then tweeted “DON’T TOUCH MY BATHING SUITS!!!” in what was initially perceived to be a rebuke against his wounded son, but the White House quickly issued a statement clarifying that it was intended as a comment on an unrelated matter.  Meanwhile, sources confirm that Eric Trump is now recovering at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, where he has been placed in a medically induced coma. Neither the president nor anyone from the first family has gone to visit him, and, according to an official spokesman, there are currently no plans to do so. While the White House is trying its best to dismiss the whole situation as a non-story, the fact that this administration sees the president’s son getting shot in the stomach as business as usual should definitely raise some eyebrows. Hopefully, Trump and his cabinet can get this chaotic situation under control as soon as possible."
Inclusivity Win! The Word Problem At The End Of This Math Worksheet Has A Guy Named Alejandro In It,N/A,https://clickhole.com/inclusivity-win-the-word-problem-at-the-end-of-this-ma-1831262435/,"Our country may have serious problems with how it treats minorities, but every now and then, you see a story that offers a glimmer of hope for a more inclusive world. This is just one beautiful example: The word problem at the end of this math worksheet has a guy named Alejandro in it. Just yes! Inclusivity for the win! The word problem, which appeared on a worksheet given to fifth grade students at Churchill Elementary school in Ohio, features two men named Jake and Alejandro, both of whom are trying to figure out how much they will have to pay for TVs that are on sale at a store called Electronics Today. Thanks to Alejandro’s presence, this awesome math question shows kids that no matter who they are or where they’re from, they deserve the opportunity to buy a TV at 20 percent off of its original price of $175, plus a 7 percent sales tax added on top of the reduced price.  In previous decades, it might have only been straight white men with names like John or David who would be deciding whether to add a pair of headphones to their purchase to get an additional 35 percent off the total, but problem number seven on this worksheet will help today’s kids understand that someone named Alejandro would be perfectly at home in that scenario. Plus, a follow-up “challenge question” asks the students to determine what fraction commercial breaks took up during the show Alejandro watched on his new TV with his friends Sarah, Jane, and Rahim—an inspiringly inclusive group full of people who prove once and for all that while white guys might have the most power in society, they’re not the only people sitting down with friends to drink eight-ounce glasses of soda at varying rates of consumption that will lead to them each finishing the soda at different times rounded up to the hundredth decimal place. Beautiful! It’s time our country learns that people of all races, creeds, and genders should get the opportunity to cover mile-long stretches of their drive to someone named Alejandro’s house at seven-eighths the speed of someone named Jane. Our hats are off to whoever wrote this awesome worksheet that proves you don’t have to be named Rebecca or Timothy to figure out how many one-by-three-foot boxes of electronics will fit inside your four-by-three-foot trunk. This is a win for inclusivity, and we hope it changes a few minds for the better!"
Overstepping Their Bounds: CNN Has Begun Sending Way-Too-Casual Push Notifications Announcing They’re Tired And Can’t Wait For The Weekend,N/A,https://clickhole.com/overstepping-their-bounds-cnn-has-begun-sending-way-to-1831157144/,"CNN has faced plenty of criticism over their reporting practices in the past, but the news organization’s latest controversy ranks among their most egregious misstep yet: CNN has begun sending way-too-casual push notifications announcing they’re tired and can’t wait for the weekend.  This is absolutely crossing the line. CNN owes everyone a major apology.  Earlier this week, CNN started abusing their ability to send news alerts out to hundreds of thousands of people’s phones to make off-handed remarks about how they’re “working for the weekend” and “cannot believe how far away Friday seems,” an inappropriately flippant use of the technology that’s usually reserved for disseminating vital news. One particularly flagrant example was an alert reading “BREAKING: Tragedy Strikes U.S. Workforce” that linked to a meme of Parks And Recreation character Ron Swanson grimacing below the words “It’s only Monday.” Check out some of CNN’s unprofessionally laid-back push notifications below:  Yikes. Needless to say, CNN has no business sending push notifications like these. Hopefully the network returns to just alerting people about real news, because their readership is bound to drop off if they keep this up."
The Hidden Price Of Environmentalism: The Cup You’ve Been Reusing For Water At Home All Week Has Started To Develop A Taste,N/A,https://clickhole.com/the-hidden-price-of-environmentalism-the-cup-you-ve-be-1831243314/,"It’s great to see that so many people are waking up to the huge threats our environment is facing, but some of our efforts to protect the Earth have unintentional side effects that may outweigh the good they do. This unsettling example might have you questioning whether the cost of some eco-friendly initiatives are really worth it: The cup you’ve been reusing for water at home all week has started to develop a taste. Unfortunately, there is a dark side to conserving our beautiful planet. You might have assumed that reusing your glassware would be a great step toward living green, but it turns out this was a devastating misconception because the cup you’ve been refilling this whole week has started giving off a quietly disgusting flavor that can only be described as kind of sour, or faintly like expired ginger. Yes, water is a valuable natural resource that we must work to conserve—but at what cost? Your glass may be one less thing you’re using excess water to wash, but on the flip side, something about the way it tastes is very, very off. Environmentalism may seem like one of those squeaky-clean causes anyone could get behind, but the way your water glass smells right now is proof positive that going green has its price. Your attempt to be eco-friendly has left you with a cup that taints any water you pour in it with an oily film, forcing you to wonder if your lips are unnaturally dirty, or maybe your dog tongued the glass when you weren’t looking. The cup’s taste is so subtle, yet so off-putting, that if someone were to tell you a ghost had recently burped into it, you would probably believe them. Score one for the Earth…zero for you. Conservation activists won’t tell you about it, but there are serious downsides to being environmentally conscious. No one wants to hear that their environmental efforts have resulted in their water glass hosting its own bitter-tasting ecosystem of bacteria—but that’s the hidden reality of environmental conservation. While you should certainly never give up on protecting the Earth from human wastefulness, it might be time to give this cup a wash because its taste has proved be far too steep a cost to bear for our planet’s sake. Kudos to you for trying."
Public Health Alert: The CDC Has Issued A Nationwide Recall On All Salmonella,N/A,https://clickhole.com/public-health-alert-the-cdc-has-issued-a-nationwide-re-1831957558/,"You’re going to want to pay attention to this latest public alert issued across the continental United States, because it may have serious health implications for you and your loved ones: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a nationwide recall on all salmonella, effective immediately. Yikes. Hopefully no one close to you has come into contact with any salmonella in the past few weeks! “There have been several reported cases of serious illness and even death as a result of salmonella, and we advise anyone who has any of the bacteria around their home to dispose of it immediately so that it cannot harm the public,” the CDC urged in a statement released this morning. “If you have bought salmonella or operate a business that provides salmonella bacteria to the public, please throw out any and all salmonella bacteria in your possession until we can ensure the public is safe and we can announce that salmonella is once again safe to consume and keep in your home,” the statement continues. The CDC says that this recall is effective for all 2,000 known strains of salmonella, including all sub-types of both Salmonella enterica and Salmonella bongori, while they sort out which strains do and do not pose a threat to the public. The announcement also urges Americans to throw out any listeria and/or E. coli bacteria that may have come in contact with salmonella within the past six months as a precautionary measure, since these infectious bacteria cultures may have become infected with salmonella. Wow, scary stuff. While these types of recalls can feel like a real hassle, when the CDC is involved, it’s always better safe than sorry. We recommend heeding the CDC’s warning and tossing out any salmonella you’ve got in your pantry or fridge. Stay safe!"
Incredibly Relatable: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Is Proving She’s Just Like Us By Wasting Her Life On Social Media,N/A,https://clickhole.com/incredibly-relatable-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-is-provi-1831156981/,"American politicians can often seem stodgy and out of touch, but superstar Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is doing her best to smash that stereotype. Ever since she got elected to represent New York’s 14th congressional district, Ocasio-Cortez has been proving she’s just like her millennial peers by wasting her life on social media. Democrats, take note: If you want to appeal to America’s youth, you’ll have to suffer through endless hours of reading and posting tweets like AOC does! Ocasio-Cortez wins the internet every day with incredible posts in which she comes off as a normal, everyday person who’s forced to be online 24/7 due to social media’s ever-tightening stranglehold on American life. She posts viral tweets to her 1.5 million followers that eloquently and passionately explain her progressive political goals, each tweet evidence of a moment Twitter has stolen from her—time she’ll never get back.  Amazing! It’s refreshing to see an elected official who actually knows how to use social media instead of being free from the interminable nightmare. Ocasio-Cortez’s Instagram game is just as on-point as the rest of her social media presence. She often live-streams herself cooking dinner in her kitchen while breaking down complex political issues, proving that the internet forces her to take work home with her and slave away late into the night during her free time when she deserves a break, just like it does to so many other millennials. That’s why voters connect with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: They can see that she’s trapped in a technological prison with no escape, just like they are. And to any Republicans thinking of criticizing AOC online, watch out, because like any young, with-it politician, she is cursed with the burden of reading your tweets and responding with an epic clapback. Being forced to read trollish posts from GOP leaders instead of just ignoring social media completely is part of AOC’s job as a member of Congress in the modern age, and it could not be more relatable! Finally, millennials have someone who shares their reluctant reliance on the internet representing them in Congress! Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is almost as inspiring as the idea of deleting all your social media accounts and being free at last from the never-ending hell that is the internet. We’re excited to see what she accomplishes on Capitol Hill!"
Improving User Experience: Facebook Has Introduced A New Service That Will Block Facebook For $20 A Month,N/A,https://clickhole.com/improving-user-experience-facebook-has-introduced-a-ne-1831950739/,"Get ready to fall back in love with Facebook all over again! The biggest social media company in the world is responding to widespread backlash against their platform with something that’s sure to get them back in the public’s good graces right away. Facebook has introduced a new service that blocks Facebook for just $20 a month. Completely disabling Facebook for only $20 a month?! Yes, please! “At Facebook, people always come first, and in our efforts to improve user experience, we will now offer our customers the option to disable Facebook completely,” said Mark Zuckerberg in a video posted to his Facebook page announcing the new service. “We listened to your concerns and we heard you loud and clear. Our new affordably priced premium service allows users to customize their Facebook experience to be as Facebook-free as they’d like. We hope you’ll join us in taking the Facebook experience to the next level.” Hear that sound? That’s the sound of millions of disgruntled Facebook users returning now that they’ll finally have the freedom to block it entirely. According to Zuckerberg’s video, the premium plan costs $20 per month and includes blocking the ability to post or view Facebook content of any kind including status updates, photos, and likes. More affordable plans include one which just blocks Facebook on weekends for $10 per month, and another which blocks Facebook on smartphones but not tablets for $15 per month. And that, folks, is how you listen to your customers and give them what they want. Kudos to Zuckerberg and his team for working so hard for Facebook users everywhere!"
"Yeah, Makes Sense: Wendy’s Announced That You Should
Understand The Gist Of Wendy’s By Now And They’re Not Going To Advertise
Anymore",N/A,https://clickhole.com/yeah-makes-sense-wendy-s-announced-that-you-should-un-1831536414/,"Wendy’s is finally displaying some common sense. This morning, the restaurant chain announced that everyone should understand the gist of Wendy’s by now and they’re not going to advertise anymore.  Can’t argue with that logic. Wendy’s is a pretty simple concept to wrap your head around, and their ads are basically beating a dead horse at this point.  “You already know what Wendy’s is,” the company explained in a press release. “We sell burgers and fries, and some other stuff like chicken nuggets and salads. Commercials are expensive, and it doesn’t make sense to pay for TV spots and billboards that just repeat the same thing over and over when there isn’t really that much to say. We’re going to stop all marketing and assume everybody is caught up on Wendy’s whole deal.”  Wendy’s noted that they would still mix things up with new sandwiches from time to time, but none of them are really newsworthy enough to justify shouting it from the rooftops. “We’ll still do stunts like throw avocado and spicy mayo on a burger and give it a name like the Double Chipotle Baconator,” said Wendy’s. “But it’s all going to be pretty similar to our regular food, and it doesn’t seem like it should be a deciding factor on whether you go to Wendy’s or not. When you’re inside the restaurant, just look up at the menu above the cash register to see if there’s anything new.” Wendy’s will also stop posting on social media, since there doesn’t seem to be a reason why a restaurant should be cracking jokes and throwing shade online, since it’s a restaurant and no sane person could possibly care about what a restaurant has to say about anything. Smart thinking on Wendy’s part! At this point, if someone’s not already on board with Wendy’s, no amount of advertising will get through to them, and it’s nice to see the company has finally figured that out."

It’s absolutely thrilling to get another chance to return to Rowling’s magical world!  In an exhilarating thread sure to delight anyone who loved reading the Harry Potter books, Rowling divulged some new secrets about the everyone’s favorite magical talking hat:  Amazing! It’s wonderful that the Harry Potter saga can continue to grow and develop even after the books have been completed. We owe a huge thanks to J.K.

Long Overdue Repairs: The Guggenheim Museum Has Finally Raised Enough Money To Make Their Building Normal ,N/A,https://clickhole.com/long-overdue-repairs-the-guggenheim-museum-has-finally-1831850831/,"Since its grand opening in 1959, the Guggenheim Museum has been a capital of art and culture in New York City, and thanks to a massive fundraising campaign, it sounds like the building is in for some long-overdue repairs. The Guggenheim Museum has finally raised enough money to make their building look normal! It’s time for a much-needed renovation for one of the world’s most famous museums! Guggenheim director Richard Armstrong made the incredible announcement at a gala for the foundation’s patrons that the museum had finally completed the five-year fundraising push necessary to fix the museum so it finally looks the way a normal building is supposed to look instead of the bizarre, lopsided beehive situation they have now. Over raucous applause, Armstrong revealed that the Guggenheim raised over $400 million from patrons and everyday visitors, which will more than cover the cost of razing all the stuff that makes the museum look weird to the ground and finally making it look the way houses or malls do, with no domes or anything. “For years, we thought the Guggenheim was doomed to forever look very stupid and bizarre,” an emotional Armstrong told the crowd. “Our weird museum looks like an ice cream cone exploded, and it has long been our greatest shame, but thanks to your generosity, we are going to finally make it the kind of meat-and-potatoes, normal building we’ve always dreamed of.” Absolutely amazing. At long last, this blighted institution will be rebuilt into something normal and square. And with the demolition of the building’s off-putting oblong dome set for early 2019, maybe the Guggenheim can finally become an artistic hub fit for Manhattan!"
"Crisis At 30,000 Feet: The Pilot Of This Flight Is Sobbing And Frantically Asking Passengers If Anyone Knows How To Spay A Cat",N/A,https://clickhole.com/crisis-at-30-000-feet-the-pilot-of-this-flight-is-sobb-1831104580/,"A waking nightmare is currently unfolding 30,000 feet in the air, and it seems like a major disaster may be imminent. The pilot of an American Airlines flight that recently departed from Los Angeles is sobbing uncontrollably and frantically asking passengers if anyone knows how to spay a cat. Something is seriously wrong, and if the pilot’s reaction is any indication, this could be a matter of life and death. American Airlines Flight 2460 left Los Angeles International Airport bound for Dallas a little after 10 a.m., but 45 minutes into the flight, the pilot sprinted out of the cockpit with tears streaming down his face and shouted that if anybody on board the plane knew how to surgically remove the a cat’s ovaries and uterus, they should come to the cockpit immediately. When nobody on the plane responded, the pilot reportedly began screaming “Oh my God!” and several trembling flight attendants called their families to bid them tearful farewells. Absolutely harrowing. The entire flight crew appears to fear the worst—at this point, they may need a miracle to survive. “We are doing everything we can to manage this crisis from the ground, but unless someone on that plane figures out how to spay a cat in the next three hours, every single person on board that plane will be killed, and we’ll be lucky to even recover the wreckage,” said a visibly shaken spokesperson for LAX in a statement to the press about the ongoing crisis. “We’ve brought several veterinarians into the control tower to try to talk the passengers and crew through the feline sterilization process, but these efforts have been unsuccessful. Our hearts go out to the families of everyone on board flight 2460.” This is truly terrifying. With the aircraft in free-fall and the lives of hundreds of passengers hanging in the balance, here’s hoping someone on that plane figures out how to spay a cat before it’s too late."
"Worth A Shot: Tylenol Announced They’re Going To Try Jacking Up The Price Of Tylenol To $1,000 A Pill Like Other Drugs Do And See If People Keep Buying It",N/A,https://clickhole.com/worth-a-shot-tylenol-announced-they-re-going-to-try-ja-1831803438/,"Big pharmaceutical companies continue to profit from skyrocketing medication prices, and it looks like Tylenol is ready to strike while the iron is hot: Tylenol has announced that they’re going to try jacking up its price to $1,000 a pill the same way other drugs do and see if people keep buying it. Wow. This is definitely a bold move from Tylenol, but from where they’re sitting, it seems like there’s no huge downside to at least taking a crack at it. At a press conference called to announce what the company is describing as a “low-risk, high-reward shot at making some real dough,” Tylenol detailed their plan to charge $1,000 per pain-relieving pill to feel out if people would actually pay that much for basic headache medicine, and if it turns out that no one does, no harm, no foul. “Basically every other pharma company is charging, like, $10,000 for cancer medicine or $8,000 for standard cardiovascular drugs, and people are actually out there paying those insane prices, so it’d honestly be dumb for Tylenol not to at least try to overcharge in this climate,” said a company spokesperson in a statement. “If this whole thing doesn’t work out, then that’s totally fine, but we figured, fuck it, let’s roll the dice a little—people might cough up some real money for Tylenol, you never know.” This is definitely a bold move. It looks like Tylenol is about to become totally unaffordable for regular people, but with today’s prescription drug prices going completely off the rails, you can’t really blame them for trying to get a piece of the action. It’ll be interesting to see whether their big swing pays off!"
Smooth Recovery: ExxonMobil Has Played Off Their Latest Massive Oil Spill As If They Did It On Purpose,N/A,https://clickhole.com/smooth-recovery-exxonmobil-has-played-off-their-latest-1831677378/,"What could have been a nightmare for one of the world’s largest energy companies just turned into a true master class on rolling with the punches: ExxonMobil has played off their latest massive oil spill as if they did it on purpose. Credit where credit is due: That’s some seriously deft handling of a tricky situation. Things looked pretty grim for ExxonMobil early yesterday afternoon when one of their tankers ran aground and dumped its massive payload of crude oil into the Gulf of Mexico, but the energy giant cleverly turned things around by releasing a series of statements to the public implying that the spill was 100% intentional. Now that’s how you stave off a potential scandal! ExxonMobil’s PR team deserves a big round of applause for this one. “ExxonMobil has decided to take our business to the next level by covering the Gulf of Mexico and several thousand miles of coastline in a thick film of crude oil, and our incredible engineers could not have done a better job of making that vision a reality,” said CEO and chairman Darren Woods in an address to the media this morning. “Our plan to rupture the hull of our largest oil tanker went off without a hitch, and now countless birds, fish, and even sea turtles are completely drenched in oil, just as we’d hoped. This has been an incredible achievement for everyone on the ExxonMobil team, especially the five crew members who happily and deliberately chose to die during the initial impact.” Confidence and savvy strategy really managed to pull this one out of the fire. Whatever your opinions on ExxonMobil, you’ve got to admit they definitely know a thing or two about turning lemons into lemonade."
Donations Needed: Wikipedia Has Posted An Appeal Asking For One Night Of Physical Intimacy From Each User,N/A,https://clickhole.com/donations-needed-wikipedia-has-posted-an-appeal-asking-1831110539/,"Every year, Wikipedia admirably provides hundreds of millions of people free access to its articles, but the website still largely depends on donors to stay afloat. Earlier today, the online encyclopedia service issued a heartfelt plea for support to help keep their operations running: Wikipedia just posted an appeal asking for one night of physical intimacy from each of their users. As of today, visitors to Wikipedia are being greeted by this brief, earnest message that pops up at the top of the page: “We hate to ask, but we need a favor. Wikipedia has always depended on support from our readers, but over 99 percent of visitors to the site have never made a contribution to our mission, which is why we’re reaching out to you today to request a single evening of physical intimacy from each of our users. If everyone who uses Wikipedia pledged just one passion-filled night of giving and receiving pleasure with us, we’d have enough toe-curling orgasms to keep us running for a lifetime—but for that to happen, we need the people to make real commitments to caressing and licking every part of us while we moan and shiver with ecstasy. We know not everyone who uses our site will be able to give us an erotic scented-oil back massage as the rest of the world seems to just melt away, but if you can, we hope you’ll consider doing so to keep Wikipedia sexually satisfied for years to come. Thank you.” Since posting the appeal, Wikipedia has added a counter to their landing page to show how many nights of physical companionship readers have pledged so far, and the featured article now links to an entry on what one-night stands with Wikipedia are generally like. The “Did You Know” section of the main page has also been updated with new facts about intimacy with Wikipedia, including tidbits like “the sweat generated from just 2 percent of our users engaging in a night of lovemaking with Wikipedia would be enough to fill the reflecting pool of the Taj Mahal” and “the versatility of the human vertebral column allows Wikipedia users to be either the big spoon or the little spoon during their single evening of passion with us.” They’ve even swapped out their classic logo for a new design of the Wikipedia globe in a steamy shower getting lathered up by a nondescript humanoid figure labeled “YOU.” It looks like Wikipedia is really pulling out all the stops in their latest appeal to their users. While it’s definitely an uphill battle to convince users to open their legs for something they already get for free, here’s hoping Wikipedia is able to get the physical intimacy they need to stave off loneliness and keep things going for another few years."
Groundbreaking Intelligence Leak: Mom Just Let It Slip That The Mysterious Boyfriend She Almost Married Before Dad Rode A Motorcycle,N/A,https://clickhole.com/groundbreaking-intelligence-leak-mom-just-let-it-slip-1831108161/,"Get ready to rethink everything you’ve always known, because an unprecedented intelligence leak has just turned our understanding of Mom’s life on its head: Mom just accidentally let it slip that the mysterious boyfriend she almost married before Dad rode a motorcycle. This shocking information is a total game changer, and all we can do now is reckon with it. We had ascertained based on a half-dozen casual anecdotes over the years that Mom dated a guy named Rick for a couple years after college before she met Dad—but only tonight did we discover that Rick owned a motorcycle. The information came to light about halfway through dinner when someone asked Mom whether she had ever ridden a motorcycle and, seemingly without thinking, she replied, “Well, Rick used to have one and he’d drive me to work on it all the time.” Dad immediately scowled and excused himself to the bathroom at the mention of Rick, who Dad once referred to as “a total jerk” under his breath. Mom then said, “Anyway, that was when I lived in Arizona and—oh, never mind,” putting a stop to the groundbreaking disclosure, but not before she had provided classified information that would forever change our understanding of Rick. Based on this unexpected leak, it seems we would not be wrong to conclude that Rick was a lot cooler than Dad—supporting the long-held but yet unproven theory that Mom might have been better off marrying him.  There is no doubt that this occurrence will have far-reaching implications when it comes to our understanding of why Dad hates Rick so much. Mom has in the past alluded to the fact that Rick was a big Talking Heads fan and thus had much cooler taste in music than Dad, who usually just listens to the Creedence Clearwater Revival station on Pandora. The knowledge that Rick also rode a motorcycle (unlike Dad, whose back problems force him to sit on a dorky-looking cushion while he drives his extremely boring Volvo station wagon) is further evidence supporting the controversial hypothesis that Rick might have been the best person mom ever dated. We had certain limited intelligence on Rick before, but our understanding just advanced by leaps and bounds. We now know more than ever about who Rick was, why Mom dated him, and how he probably made Mom way happier than Dad does. This is stunning data that we will be grappling with it for quite some time."
Fighting Fire With Fire: Mitch McConnell Is Attempting To Channel AOC’s Populist Appeal By Preparing A Supper Of Boiled Dog Live On Instagram,N/A,https://clickhole.com/fighting-fire-with-fire-mitch-mcconnell-is-attempting-1830947150/,"Congresswoman-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) has cultivated much of her extraordinary grassroots success through her candor and authenticity on social media, and now it appears that her foes across the aisle have caught on and are starting to crib from her playbook: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) just tried to channel Ocasio-Cortez’s populist appeal by cooking a supper of boiled dog live on Instagram. Hey, if it works for her, maybe it’ll work for the GOP. Speaking live to his 7,087 Instagram followers from his upscale D.C. townhome last night, the 76-year-old McConnell walked viewers step-by-step through his great-grandmother’s famous boiled dog recipe in an attempt to make himself seem more relatable to everyday Americans, clearly taking cues from similar cooking videos made by Ocasio-Cortez in recent weeks. Dressed in cowboy chaps and a T-shirt that said “BIG FOOTBALL GAME,” McConnell described the dish as a “hearty, normal American meal that only costs $700 to make and can sustain a blue-collar family like mine for numerous sustenance cycles.” The Senate majority leader then led a sick, elderly basset hound into his kitchen, licked his lips with anticipation, and declared that no ritzy D.C. steakhouse dinner could ever live up to the delicious, dry taste of boiled hound haunch. “The first thing you’re gonna want to do is get out your dog-smashing brick and hit the dog in the head with it until it’s mostly dead,” said a smiling McConnell before producing a large brick and vigorously bashing the basset hound’s skull for 10 minutes straight, at one point pausing to remind viewers to be sure to save any brain chunks that fly out to make brain milk later. “After that, put the dog in a big pot with 30 cups of salt and some Tylenol, just like Granny McConnell used to do. Then set the pot on fire for about nine hours until the dog becomes pulp. You’ll know it’s ready for sure when the meat starts hissing. Now, this isn’t gonna be the fanciest food you’ve ever eaten, but it’s down-home, regular American cooking that’ll fill you up and keep you energized during a long day of sawing at the minimum-wage automobile factory.” As he live-streamed the dog slowly rendering and gurgling in its own viscera on the stovetop over the ensuing nine hours, Senator McConnell continued engaging his viewers with everyman banter, talking candidly about how he enjoys participating in classic American pastimes such as using hammers to fix his house, watching DVDs about spiders, and shooting machine guns in elementary schools. When he seemed to eventually run out of things to talk about, McConnell opted to recite the Pledge Of Allegiance very slowly for several hours until the boiled dog finally finished cooking, at which point the GOP leader hastily consumed 20 pounds of the molten, tarry dog hash in an unblinking frenzy while the “American Rock ’N’ Roll” preset on a Casio keyboard blared in the background. After completing his meal, McConnell announced to his viewers that he needed to go do some repairs on his all-American monster truck, after which he stood up, recited the Pledge Of Allegiance one more time, and then stared frightened into the camera for several minutes until his security detail entered the frame and escorted him away. Wow! While Rep-elect Ocasio-Cortez’s Instagram prowess might’ve given her the upper hand during the midterms, she shouldn’t rest on her laurels quite yet, because Mitch McConnell just proved that Republicans can be just as effective at using social media to win over the American people. But whether it’s a liberal or a conservative, in any case, it’s always refreshing to be reminded that, at the end of the day, politicians are just ordinary people who go home and make dinner like the rest of us."
"Honoring A Legend: After Sitting Courtside At Lakers Games For Over Four Decades, Jack Nicholson Is Now Allowed To Shower With The Team",N/A,https://clickhole.com/honoring-a-legend-after-sitting-courtside-at-lakers-ga-1831078704/,"As a season ticket-holder for over four decades, Jack Nicholson has become an iconic fan of the Los Angeles Lakers, passionately cheering on the team from his courtside seats at nearly every home game, and it looks like the team is finally returning the favor: The L.A. Lakers have announced that Jack Nicholson is now allowed to shower with the team! Wow. What a wonderful way to honor a legendary figure in Lakers history! After the final buzzer of this Monday’s home game at the Staples Center, Lakers general manager Magic Johnson called Nicholson off the sidelines and onto the court in front of thousands of cheering fans. With the entire team standing by, Johnson announced that, as a sign of gratitude for his tireless support of the team, Jack Nicholson was forever welcome to strip down in the locker room and wash himself off alongside the Lakers players. “Jack, your love of the Lakers and your dedication to this team has always been a source of inspiration for us, and nobody deserves to shower with these players more than you,” Johnson said as he presented an overjoyed Nicholson with an honorary key to the shower and a Lakers towel as the entire crowd cheered. An emotional Nicholson had to fight back tears as he thanked the Lakers and the entire city of Los Angeles for the incredible honor and immediately began stripping off his clothing as he walked toward the Lakers’ locker room to take his first post-game shower. Absolutely beautiful. It’s amazing to see the Lakers willing to go above and beyond to show their gratitude to their most dedicated supporter. Hopefully, Jack Nicholson enjoys the privilege of getting to clean himself alongside Lakers greats like Lonzo Ball and LeBron James. Other NBA take note: This is how you treat your fans!"
"Streamlined Ceremony: To Save
Time The Oscars Are Ditching The Award Show And Instead Will Just Post An Excel
Spreadsheet Listing All The Winners",N/A,https://clickhole.com/streamlined-ceremony-to-save-time-the-oscars-are-ditch-1831045747/,"It’s no secret that the Academy had trouble finding a host for this year’s Oscars, but fortunately that won’t be a problem anymore. To streamline the infamously long ceremony, the Oscars will ditch the awards show entirely and instead post a simple Microsoft Excel spreadsheet listing all the winners.  Smart idea! Instead of having a host present an expensive four-hour ceremony, now everyone can quickly glance at a doc to find out who is taking home Hollywood’s highest honor. “This is the 21st century, and computers exist now,” explained the Academy in a press release announcing the improved Oscars. “There’s no reason to force millions of people to turn on a TV and watch boring celebrities banter with each other for ages just to get a very small amount of information that can easily be displayed in a few Excel columns and rows. On February 24, just log on to Oscars.org and press the “download” button to open the .xls file on your computer and see which actors and filmmakers will be receiving an Oscar in the mail.”  Awesome! Now watching the Oscars will only take you a few convenient seconds. Best of all, the Oscars spreadsheet entirely eliminates the need to find a host! Although most of the usual Oscars ceremony will be skipped, the In Memoriam segment is sticking around as a second worksheet page, and you can view everyone that died by clicking the tab on the bottom of your screen. That’s much quicker than playing movie clips accompanied by sad music! Now that watching the Oscars won’t eat up your whole evening and has been condensed to an Excel file, you have a new reason to actually tune in this year. Hollywood’s biggest night just got better than ever!"
Amazing! A Shaken Christian Bale Has Revealed The Only Preparation He Did To Play Dick Cheney Was Eating A Caesar Salad That Immediately Made Him Bald And Fat,N/A,https://clickhole.com/amazing-a-shaken-christian-bale-has-revealed-the-only-1830796265/,"When it comes to actors who throw themselves into their roles, few performers in Hollywood are as dedicated as Christian Bale. The method actor’s physical transformation for Adam McKay’s Vice is among the most impressive of his career, and the way he did it will blow your mind: A shaken Christian Bale just revealed that the only preparation he did to play Dick Cheney was eating a Caesar salad that immediately made him bald and fat.  Simply amazing. This is method acting at its absolute peak!  At a press junket to promote the upcoming Dick Cheney biopic, a trembling, teary-eyed Christian Bale was nearly at a loss for words explaining how all he’d done to get ready for the role was eat a Caesar salad that somehow caused him to instantly gain 40 pounds and lose almost all his hair on the spot. Bale, notorious for the intensive exercise and eating regimens he embraced for films like The Machinist and American Hustle, fumbled with his microphone and hyperventilated as he told reporters he had made the Caesar salad himself at home, eaten it, and quickly realized something happened when his children began screaming “Daddy’s gone large!” as the buttons on his dress shirt burst off onto the floor along with most of the hair on his scalp, his ballooning stomach emitting the sound of an ascending slide whistle note with every inch it swelled outward. Despite having several months to capture Cheney’s physicality before shooting, it only took a seasoned pro like Bale one light lunch to get into character and pretty much guarantee himself an Oscar nomination. Whatever that Caesar salad did to Christian has paid off, because it has left the former Batman actor looking confused, slightly traumatized, and virtually unrecognizable. He has totally disappeared into this role!  Wow. Christian Bale’s next-level acting techniques have our jaws on the floor yet again. Whether you’re a fan of his performances or not, you’ve just got to respect his devotion to his work. We couldn’t be more excited for Vice right now!"
"Improving Journalism: The Washington Post Is
Changing Its Slogan To ‘Democracy Dies In Darkness, Fascism Dies In Light, Read
The Washington Post Each Day To Make Your Brain All Right’",N/A,https://clickhole.com/improving-journalism-the-washington-post-is-changing-i-1830666687/,"In 2017, The Washington Post adopted the slogan “Democracy Dies In Darkness.” It was a bold message affirming their mission to speak truth to power—and today, that slogan has been improved even further. On this morning’s front page, the paper once again changed their motto to “Democracy Dies In Darkness, Fascism Dies In Light, Read The Washington Post Each Day To Make Your Brain All Right.” What an inspiring message. This is what quality journalism looks like! In an editorial explaining the change, the Post wrote “Although our old slogan explained that democracy dies in darkness, it failed to also impart that fascism dies in light or that the public should read The Washington Post every day to make their brains all right. Our new and improved tagline adequately clarifies that when dictatorship rears its ugly head, onward forth our brave reporters tread. Through misinformation’s dreary fog, we march to the First Amendment’s valiant drumbeat, till each pertinent fact has been logged and printed upon our broadsheet.” Wow. The Washington Post will stop at nothing to provide people with the information they need to understand what’s really going on in our country — and now they have a new slogan to prove it. “Ne’er shall we falter, afraid to break a story,” continued the WaPo article. “Our editors will correct all typos and achieve eternal glory. Hush now, and listen for that approaching growl of beast! ’Tis the wolf of autocracy, hungrily stalking freedom through Washington, D.C.’s gloom-shrouded night. To thwart the hound’s bloodthirsty feast, our reporters look for scoops that will ignite the lantern of information’s light.”  “Do not mistake this toast for an idle boast,” added the letter from the editors, “for the gleaming hoard of Pulitzers upon our shelf more than speaks for itself.” “That is why we felt it was time to update our slogan again,” said the editorial in closing, stating that “we vow to defend the fourth estate with every last drop of blood that flows within our veins, and vex corrupt politicians with unending pains. We are the shield of knowledge that turns aside the arrow of lies, we are truth’s dauntless centurion patrolling the stalwart ramparts of your mind, protecting your intellect from censorship with each complex issue we summarize. We believe this vital goal is aptly summed up by our new catchphrase, a heroic creed which The Washington Post shall live up to forever and always.” Wonderful! Now when people read The Washington Post’s motto, they’ll have a better idea of the important journalistic ideals the paper stands for. In these tumultuous political times, using the light of truth to kill fascism and make Americans’ brains all right is more important than ever. Thank you for leading the charge, WaPo!"
Exonerated? New Evidence Reveals That Steven Avery Likely Couldn’t Have Killed Teresa Halbach Because He Was Transformed Into A Bird At The Time Of The Murder,N/A,https://clickhole.com/exonerated-new-evidence-reveals-that-steven-avery-like-1830547281/,"The controversy over Steven Avery’s involvement in Teresa Halbach’s murder, depicted on hit Netflix docuseries Making A Murderer, has had viewers wondering about the possibility of Avery’s innocence for years. But now, a bombshell revelation might just be enough to exonerate him: New evidence has revealed that Avery likely could not have killed Teresa Halbach because he was transformed into a bird at the time of the murder. After a protracted legal battle that has left America confounded, could this be the evidence that exonerates Avery once and for all? This week, Avery’s lead defense lawyer, Kathleen Zellner, filed a motion detailing new evidence that the defense claims could prove Avery was incapable of killing and dismembering Halbach due to the fact that he had been transfigured into a beautiful American kestrel on the afternoon the murder occurred. According to the document, multiple witnesses have come forward to testify that on the afternoon of October 31, they saw Avery disappear in a flash of light, leaving only a delicate Falco sparverius where he had been standing.  “At about 3 p.m. on the day of the murder, I was standing on the side of the road when I saw Steven walk towards me. That was when he stopped for a second, then all of a sudden turned into a bird and just flew away,” read the testimony from Denny Tritz, a mailman in Avery’s hometown of Manitowoc County, WI. “He started out big, but then he became tiny, sprouted feathers, and let out a real loud screech before flapping his wings and soaring into the sky.”  If that testimony isn’t convincing enough, a waitress at a nearby diner who watched the transformation take place from across the street took a cell phone video of the event, which shows a slightly blurry Avery dematerializing in a burst of light particles from which a medium-sized bird immediately emerges. Wow. These witness’ accounts might be just what the defense needs to counter the prosecution’s claims. The document filed by Avery’s defense also includes an analysis from a panel of forensics experts who have determined that the blood spatter patterns in Teresa’s RAV4 and Avery’s garage are not consistent with the type of violence that a medium-sized bird would be able to achieve.  “Given that it seems Avery was only about 30 cm in length and 4 oz in weight at the time of the crime—in addition to the fact that he had talons and wings but no hands—he would neither have been able to stab and strangle Teresa, nor handle the .22 rifle that was used to shoot her,” wrote blood spatter analyst Colin Deslisle. “The most he would have been able to do to Teresa would have been to scratch and peck at her, which would not have created the type of cast-off pattern seen at the scene of the murder.” Incredible. This new evidence really may be the key to cracking open the Steven Avery case at long last. We’re excited to see how the lawyers on either side of the case are able to incorporate it into their arguments if the trial reopens. Whatever happens in Steven Avery’s story, this revelation will likely be a big turning point. Let’s hope that justice is served!"
Nature Is Beautiful: A New Study Has Shown That When A Blue Whale Dies Its Body Can Feed Scientists For 3 Whole Years,N/A,https://clickhole.com/nature-is-beautiful-a-new-study-has-shown-that-when-a-1830566203/,"As the largest animals to have ever lived, blue whales are widely regarded as among the most extraordinary creatures on the planet, yet researchers have now determined that these gentle giants are even more incredible than previously believed: A new study has shown that when a blue whale dies, its body can feed scientists for three whole years. Wow! Nature truly is amazing! Following an exhaustive three-year study, marine biologists at Duke University discovered that the carcass of a 300,000-pound blue whale, if properly divided into Tupperware containers and stored in refrigerators, can sustain a 15-person team of hungry researchers for several years on end—proving that these majestic animals continue contributing to ecosystems long after their deaths. The well-fed team found that once a blue whale dies, researchers will scavenge not only the cetacean’s fins and flanks for meat but also its brain, eyes, and sexual organs, wasting no part of the animal as they divide its flesh up into hundreds of manageable chunks to be equally distributed amongst themselves and their research assistants, supplying them with enough food to last them for every single breakfast, lunch, and dinner for 36 consecutive months. “We’d hypothesized that one might get tired of only eating whale for such a long period of time, but we were surprised to discover that the meat is remarkably versatile, essentially serving as a blank caloric canvas for whatever delicious spices, marinades, or sauces one is craving,” said Dr. Thomas Westman, the study’s lead researcher. “It took millions of years of evolutionary adaptations for these animals to develop such choice cuts of meat, and the fact that one can eat nothing but blue whale for three years and not get sick of it is an incredible testament to the perfect economy of nature’s design.” Dr. Westman noted that even once a blue whale’s carcass has been picked completely clean of its meat, researchers will utilize the remaining bones to create delectable marrow- and broth-based dishes—a phenomenon that reveals the astonishing efficiency of the food chain and the critical role that even the mightiest species play in supporting the life around them. Whoa. That is so awesome! Just when we thought blue whales couldn’t get any cooler, they go ahead and prove how magical they are once again. And to think that there’s still so much we have yet to learn about these beautiful, mysterious creatures. Nature is seriously freaking amazing!"
Gearing Up For 2020? Bernie Sanders Just Slapped Barron Trump In The Face And Called Him A Bimbo,N/A,https://clickhole.com/gearing-up-for-2020-bernie-sanders-just-slapped-barron-1830570391/,"While it’s still unclear what the candidate pool will look like for the 2020 presidential election, one popular politician just sent what seems to be a pretty strong signal that he’s gearing up to run: Bernie Sanders just slapped Barron Trump in the face and called him a bimbo. Yep, it’s definitely looking like Bernie’s got his eye on the Oval Office. The junior senator from Vermont made his presidential aspirations unmistakably clear earlier today when he stormed through the doors of the elite private school where Barron is a student, grabbed the 12-year-old by the collar, and slapped him hard across the face, leaving a bright red handprint on the boy’s right cheek. “Go suck an egg, bimbo!” barked Sanders as he struck the child, eliciting gasps from onlookers who likely immediately recognized the huge implications the violent gesture would have on the 2020 race. “And tell your old man to suck an egg, too, you piss-licking ignoramus! You ass-brained coward! You long, bald skunk! Why, I oughtta—” Sanders then tried to slap Barron a second time but was subdued by the boy’s Secret Service detail, which dragged the 77-year-old Democratic Socialist away as he continued to yell belligerently about how the United States of America needs leaders who will work for all people, not just the 1 percent. And though Sanders didn’t go as far as formally announcing a presidential bid, he teased his higher-office ambitions one more time while being carried out of the school, shouting that he would one day convert Barron’s playroom in the White House into a “sauna where I can walk on my elliptical” and that he would “issue an executive order to deport your dead-eyed mother back to Yugoslavia”—exactly the type of bold, forward-thinking rhetoric you’d expect out of someone hoping to become America’s next commander in chief. Wow. Though we’ve just barely made it past the midterms, it already seems like election season is about to swing back into full gear, and if today’s events are any indication, it looks like it’ll be Bernie Sanders leading the charge on the campaign trail."
"A Hero’s Reward: George H.W. Bush Is Sitting In
Valhalla Nervously Drinking A Glass Of Water While Dead Vikings Battle Around Him",N/A,https://clickhole.com/a-hero-s-reward-george-h-w-bush-is-sitting-in-valhall-1830831229/,"After a lifetime of public service, America’s 41st commander in chief has passed on to his eternal reward. President George H.W. Bush is currently sitting in Valhalla, nervously drinking a glass of water while Vikings battle around him. Farewell, sir! Although you may be a little out of your element, you’ve more than earned your spot amongst the brave Norse warriors joyously reveling in the afterlife with endless wine and warfare. Although the 94-year-old didn’t die a heroic death in battle, apparently being a U.S. veteran and presiding over the Gulf War was enough for the former president to gain admittance to Odin’s mead hall. There Mr. Bush rests enshrined in glory, sitting hunched over at a long oaken table and trying to ignore the boisterous Viking berserkers constantly dismembering each other with battle axes and spears, only to laugh as their wounds are magically healed so they might fight anew. Valkyrie shield-maidens offered to bring Mr. Bush a drinking horn of honey-wine that he might quaff to satisfy his thirst between violent melees, but the deceased POTUS instead asked them to bring him a glass of water with one ice cube. He is now trying to remain very quiet so nobody in Valhalla pays attention to him as they slaughter each other with reckless abandon.  When not taking occasional small sips from his cup of water, Mr. Bush keeps his hand covering the top of the glass to protect his beverage from the splattering blood and viscera. He might not entirely feel at ease amongst the gory festivity, but with his anxious silence, the elder Bush is still displaying the civility and class he brought to the Oval Office. George H.W. Bush may have only served one term as president, but he will spend thousands of years amongst the joyful, bloodthirsty Norsemen, sitting quietly with his glass of water until the end of days when the wolf Fenrir breaks free of its chain and all the warriors of Valhalla must fight alongside Odin in the final apocalyptic battle of Ragnarok. It is the highest honor a dead Viking raider could ever hope for, and it’s wonderful that George H.W. Bush is there, too. Goodbye, Mr. President! America salutes you!"

Finally! Thanks to Dole, the kids of the future will actually beg their parents for nutritious apples with toys inside of them instead of pizza and fries. After years of development, genetic engineers at Dole have used cutting-edge biotechnology to create a breed of apple that can grow an okay-looking plastic figurine inside of it. Now when children bite into a Granny Smith or a Gala, they might just see the face of a toy soldier looking back at them from inside their healthy snack! Dole even has plans to partner with companies like Disney and Nickelodeon to one day grow figurines of classic characters like SpongeBob SquarePants or Mickey Mouse inside various types of fruit. “We at Dole are very excited about the possibilities of growing toys inside of apples, and we hope to expand our technology to the point where the toys that grow inside our produce are not filled with seeds,” said Jill Arnold, the head of Dole’s biotechnology department. “For the time being, the toys present a dangerous choking hazard, so we recommend that parents supervise their children while eating any fruits that grow their own prizes, but nevertheless we’re beyond thrilled that we’ve been able to make nutritious snacking fun for children.” Wow. There’s no doubt that kids are about to go wild for Dole’s new toy-filled apples. The company even says that they’re working on a method for making the toys non-toxic so that children no longer become sick when they eat their fruit! A whole generation of kids is about to find out just how exciting eating healthy foods can be!"

"Rules Are Rules: Jeff Bezos
Was Just Fired From Amazon For Getting A Tattoo",N/A,https://clickhole.com/rules-are-rules-jeff-bezos-was-just-fired-from-amazon-1830341656/,"Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos may be the richest person on Earth, but he still has to follow the rules like everyone else. Bezos just found that out the hard way when he was fired from Amazon for getting a tattoo. Sorry, Jeff, but rules are rules. Just because you have $156 billion doesn’t mean you can do whatever you want. The firing went down yesterday, when Bezos arrived for work at Amazon’s Seattle headquarters sporting a large, freshly inked tattoo of Pegasus on his neck and face, which, though tastefully done, was in clear violation of the company’s policy on visible skin art. He was immediately pulled aside by two HR managers, who informed him that, as an employee who often interacts with important clients and investors, they felt that his tattoo gave him an unprofessional appearance that would hinder his ability to effectively represent the company moving forward. They added that had Bezos gotten a small tattoo on his arm or lower back that could be covered up by clothing, perhaps Amazon could have looked the other way, but the reality is that his new tattoo is enormous and goes way above his shirt collar, making it impossible not to notice. After the company informed him that his employment was being terminated, Bezos was given only half an hour to pack his personal effects into a cardboard box before security escorted him out of the building. It’s harsh, but to be fair, Bezos was fully aware of the company’s no-visible-tattoos policy yet still decided to get inked up anyway. Bezos is going to have to dust off his résumé and look for another job, but it might be hard for him to find new work now that he has a huge tattoo covering his neck and face. You can’t help but feel sorry for the guy, but by violating Amazon’s rules on tattoos he completely brought this on himself."
Historic Exhibit: Barack Obama’s Bones Are On Display At The Smithsonian,N/A,https://clickhole.com/historic-exhibit-barack-obama-s-bones-are-on-display-a-1830742708/,"All you history buffs out there are going to want to clear some space in your calendar and plan a trip to Washington, DC to see an absolutely unforgettable new exhibit! Nearly two years after completing his historic presidency, Barack Obama’s bones are currently on display at the Smithsonian for the first time! This is an incredible opportunity to get a firsthand look at the 44th president’s skeleton up close and in person! As of Monday of this week, the full set of bones of former U.S. President Barack Obama, who served from 2008 to 2016, can be seen at the Smithsonian’s National Museum of American History’s new exhibit dedicated to his life and presidency. Obama’s skeleton, which up to this point had been stored underground in an archive beneath the museum and away from public view, has been fully reconstructed by some of the nation’s top paleontologists, and the display will give visitors the chance to observe for themselves the size and stature of the “Yes We Can” president whose inauguration and presidency still represent hope for much of the country. Seriously, this is not something any fans of American history are going to want to miss. Anybody who can make the trip will not regret taking the time to witness the skeleton of the groundbreaking commander in chief who helped pass the Affordable Care Act and who was in the situation room as Osama bin Laden was brought to justice in 2011. Along with President Obama’s bones, the exhibit also includes a replica of the former president’s Nobel Peace Prize, as well as the skull of his beloved pet dog, Bo. This is pretty much as close as you can get to actually meeting Barack Obama in person! President Obama’s incredible legacy as the first African American president and a progressive icon deserves to be remembered and honored, which is why it’s so awesome that the Smithsonian has made his skeleton available for the world to see for the first time! Be sure to check it out because this exhibit sounds like a must-see!"
Science Win: Anthropologists Now Believe Neanderthals Had Big Stupid Grins On Their Faces Pretty Much All The Time,N/A,https://clickhole.com/science-win-anthropologists-now-believe-neanderthals-h-1830714726/,"Researchers have just announced an incredible scientific discovery that could completely change the way we understand one of mankind’s closest evolutionary relatives: According to a groundbreaking new study, anthropologists now believe that Neanderthals had big stupid grins on their faces pretty much all the time. Whoa. This is a seriously major breakthrough! Following an exhaustive five-year study, a team of researchers at Oxford University says it’s uncovered incontrovertible proof that Neanderthals were more or less just always strolling around and smiling like idiots, their lips spread so wide that their faces basically looked horizontally bisected in a Muppet-like fashion. Knowing that Neanderthals were constantly sporting huge, goofy-ass grins that fully bared their teeth and gums could have massive implications on how we perceive these early ancestors and what their role was in the emergence of modern humans. “By digitally overlaying the muscle and tissue structure over jaw fossils gathered from across Europe, it’s evident that Neanderthals always had big, shit-eating grins on their faces that would bug the hell out of everyone they came into contact with,” said Dr. Sarah Ellens, the study’s lead researcher. “We’ve known for some time that Neanderthals were adept at using tools, but, interestingly, when we analyze oxidation levels on teeth and dental fragments, what we find is that basically no matter what they were doing—whether banging away with their hammers, hunting animals, or huddling for warmth—their mouths were pretty much always hanging wide open, smiling ear-to-ear with obnoxious, self-satisfied looks plastered on their faces.” Dr. Ellens continued to say that by studying things like the Neanderthals’ cave etchings, larynx structures, and social patterns, her team was also able to conclude that they were probably always whistling made-up, silly little songs to themselves and giving big friendly hellos to passersby. The researchers posit that this happy-go-lucky behavior was likely a primary contributing factor to the species’ eventual extinction, as late Neanderthals’ eagerness to walk up very close to members of emerging Homo sapiens populations and smile at them from less than an inch away almost certainly exposed them to the foreign viral pathogens that would wipe their kind from the face of the earth. Yet even as their entire species was being mercilessly annihilated by horrific disease, researchers say the Neanderthals nonetheless continued to sport their ridiculous shit-eating grins, utterly oblivious to their dire circumstances. Amazing! The importance of these new discoveries cannot be overstated, as the revelation that Neanderthals constantly had gigantic wacky smiles on their faces will forever change the way we study and perceive our early ancestors. Someone get the Nobel Committee on the phone, because this is, without a doubt, the biggest scientific breakthrough of the year."
Sexier Than Ever: Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Johnson Is Looking Amazing After Murdering His Uncle And Stealing His Wig,N/A,https://clickhole.com/sexier-than-ever-dwayne-the-rock-johnson-is-looking-1830504015/,"Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson was already one of the most attractive stars on the planet, but he somehow just found a way to be even hotter than he already was: Dwayne Johnson is looking absolutely amazing after murdering his uncle and stealing his wig. Wow! He really is more gorgeous than ever now! It seemed like it was impossible for Dwayne Johnson to get any more perfect, but the Jumanji star managed to achieve the impossible earlier this week when he strangled his uncle and pilfered the wig from his dead body, leaving him with a tasteful hairpiece that makes it look like he’s got a healthy shock of black hair on top of his beautiful head. The Rock could be seen walking through Hollywood all day yesterday showing off his brand-new wig, which once belonged to his uncle and had for years aroused intense jealousy from the actor. Johnson says the desire to possess the wig ate away at him day and night, and when he finally could take it no longer, he murdered his uncle in cold blood so that he could have the wig. It’s a choice that definitely paid off, because now that he has his dead uncle’s wig, Dwayne is definitely looking younger and more confident. Johnson addressed his recent acquisition of his uncle’s wig in a steamy tell-all article in GQ magazine, saying, “My uncle thought he could keep this wig all to himself, but I proved him wrong by strangling him in a parking garage, and now I am the one with the nice hair. My uncle screamed when I killed him, but he would not give me the wig any other way. Now I have the wig and I look amazing. I look like Paul McCartney.” Swoon! We’d seriously give anything to score a date with this dreamboat! Seeing how incredible Johnson looks now, we honestly wish he’d snapped his uncle’s neck and stolen his wig years ago. We’ll take The Rock any way he comes, but if you ask us, he looks sexiest when he’s sporting his dead uncle’s wig."
Despicable: Donald Trump Jr. Just Posted A Photo Of Himself Proudly Posing With A Worm He Shot On The White House Lawn,N/A,https://clickhole.com/despicable-donald-trump-jr-just-posted-a-photo-of-him-1830344000/,"Donald Trump Jr. has repeatedly made it clear he has no regard for wildlife. One quick Google image search will reveal that the president’s eldest son has a penchant for trophy hunting animals like leopards and elephants abroad. Now he’s brought this despicable hobby back home: Donald Trump Jr. just posted a photo of himself proudly posing with a worm he shot on the White House lawn.  This is revolting. How could someone take such pride in depriving a beautiful animal of its life? Donald Jr. took to Instagram today with a photo of himself decked out in camouflage and kneeling beside the remains of a worm he’d slain from behind a Rose Garden bush with a .458 Winchester rifle. With one hand on the gun and the other holding up the mangled remains of the worm’s body to display his “trophy,” Don Jr.’s boastful display of wanton cruelty is sure to set off a wave of righteous outrage from conservationists and animal lovers across the country.  Big “man” you are, Don Jr., killing a defenseless worm. Shame on you. To see an animal die for this man’s vanity is so upsetting we want to cry. As the son of a president notoriously hostile to conservation efforts, Don Jr. and the whole first family continue to represent a dire threat to wildlife everywhere. Just awful. "
Worst Possible Timing: Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s Aides Are Desperately Trying To Talk Her Out Of Teaching Herself To Do A Front Flip,N/A,https://clickhole.com/worst-possible-timing-ruth-bader-ginsburg-s-aides-are-1830499703/,"With the Supreme Court now occupied by a conservative majority, the prospect of President Trump appointing yet another right-leaning justice to the bench has liberals absolutely terrified. And unfortunately, it now looks like the health one of the Court’s few remaining liberals might be in serious jeopardy: According to reports, Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s aides are desperately trying to talk her out of teaching herself to do a front flip. Wow. Justice Ginsburg’s timing could not be worse here. Earlier this week, sources inside the nation’s highest court reported that aides close to Ginsburg were working around the clock to dissuade the 85-year-old justice from learning how to do a front flip, which she’s been preparing for by watching parkour videos on YouTube and laying a single couch cushion on her office floor as a means of breaking her fall. So far, Justice Ginsburg has only ignored her assistants’ pleas, paying no mind to the fact that performing a standing front tuck would be difficult for even a fit young person, let alone an octogenarian in physical decline. Though assistants have warned her about the various grave injuries she could potentially suffer, sources say that Justice Ginsburg feels a duty to attempt the flip so that she can prove to young girls that women are capable of doing anything they set their minds to. To her staff’s dismay, Ginsburg has also dismissed suggestions that she try a safer maneuver more suited for someone of her age and physicality, such as a slow somersault with several aides carefully guiding her, or even just gently spinning all the way around in a computer chair so that she can still experience a 360-degree rotation but without having to hurl herself head over heels. Sources say that not only is Ginsburg insistent on trying to do a front flip, but she’d also like to do one as soon as possible and is actually readying herself for an attempt later today. According to reports, Ginsburg is currently suiting up in a wrestling singlet and cleats and is listening to “Rock And Roll Part 2” by Gary Glitter to hype her up for the feat, sending her clerks into full-on panic mode. While her staff is frantically urging her to consider the hard-won progressive legislation that would be at stake if she were to botch the flip and incur an injury that forces her to retire, Ginsburg reportedly will not be dissuaded and is now applying Icy Hot to her knees and lower back to ready her joints and muscles for the impending attempt. Yikes. It looks like the same steadfast tenacity that made Ginsburg’s legal legacy so impactful may also be its own undoing. Liberals had better pray that Ginsburg’s aides get through to her, because years of social progress could be lost if Trump gets the chance to appoint another conservative justice to the Supreme Court. Please be careful, RBG! America needs you!"
Eco-Warriors: These Brave Environmental Activists Have Chained Themselves To A Humpback Whale To Protect It From Japanese Hunters,N/A,https://clickhole.com/eco-warriors-these-brave-environmental-activists-have-1830346562/,"Despite large-scale efforts to ban whaling for good, countries like Japan still slaughter thousands of whales every year. But a brave group of eco-warriors is making an incredible sacrifice in order to help conserve our seas’ precious wildlife: These environmental activists have chained themselves to a humpback whale to protect it from Japanese hunters. Absolutely astounding. “Courageous” barely even begins to describe these fearless wildlife advocates! Earlier this week, a hunting expedition out of Osaka was tracking down a mature female humpback, only to be foiled by WhaleSentinel, a group of 15 activists who had chained themselves around the whale’s body, leaving the whaling vessel no way to harpoon the animal without endangering several humans in the process. Since that first encounter with a hunting ship, the majestic whale has journeyed hundreds of miles through the sea, sometimes diving 100 meters underwater for extended periods of time—but the amazing activists at WhaleSentinel have held strong and refused to unchain themselves, all so that the beautiful whale may live safely in her natural habitat. Doesn’t this scale of personal sacrifice just blow you away? These selfless activists are fighting for a better world for all of us. WhaleSentinel members made it clear from the get-go that threats of arrest from the Japanese Coast Guard would not diminish their commitment to protect the whale’s life, shouting, “Stop the slaughter!” and attempting to hand out informational pamphlets to passing ships whenever the whale breached the surface. At this point, it seems like nothing can shake their dedication to the humpback they’ve defiantly chained themselves to, no matter how much seawater they swallow or how pruned their skin becomes. Give it up for these eco-heroes! One brave act of civil disobedience is sparing this beautiful animal from senseless slaughter. Seeing these environmental warriors chained to a whale just shows the impact a few people can make when they put others’ lives before their own. Hopefully this incredible act of conservation inspires more people to get involved, because our planet’s wildlife could certainly use a lot more allies like these!"
"Atheists Rejoice: Stephen Hawking’s Ghost Just Confirmed That God Doesn’t Exist, Though There’s A Huge Mean Horse In Heaven Who Pretty Much Acts Like God That Everyone Obeys Out Of Fear",N/A,https://clickhole.com/atheists-rejoice-stephen-hawking-s-ghost-just-confirme-1830343828/,"During his life, famed physicist Stephen Hawking was never shy about expressing his atheistic worldview, and now it appears as if death has only further validated his beliefs: The ghost of Stephen Hawking just officially confirmed that God does not exist, though there is a huge mean horse in Heaven who pretty much acts like God that everyone obeys out of fear. Sorry, religious wackjobs, but it looks like we now have air-tight, empirical proof that God is nothing more than a fairy tale! Communicating from the afterlife through the speech synthesizer on his old wheelchair, Hawking’s ghost transmitted a series of messages to the people of Earth earlier this week declaring that God is indeed a myth, noting that the closest thing there is to an all-powerful being is a very large and scary horse who has bullied his way into what is essentially a godlike role. Noting that the horse is quick to anger and immune to reason, the incorporeal Professor Hawking said that nearly everyone in the eternal realm lives in constant fear of the brutish 30-foot-tall equine, which often bites people without provocation and demands to be worshipped by his peers. “In the absence of a divine creator, this horse has asserted himself as the supreme authority of the Great Beyond, and because he is really strong and insane, we basically let him have his way,” said the departed Hawking, noting that the horse’s name is Gomer, but he insists on being called “Sex Christ.” “This gigantic and cruel horse is always chasing people around and knocking things over and eating everyone else’s food. When I arrived in the afterlife, he called me a nerd and told me that if I didn’t bow down and say, ‘Sex Christ is my one true master,’ he would urinate in my mouth. I did as he asked, but he still urinated in my mouth.” “Although the scientific laws of our universe do not allow for the existence of an omnipotent God, they do allow for a muscular, angry horse,” Hawking’s ghost continued. Hell yeah! Looks like God isn’t real and the atheists were right all along! The deceased Cambridge professor went on to detail many more examples of Sex Christ’s tyranny, including how for hours every day he forces all the ghosts to sing him a modified version of the worship song “Shout To The Lord” called “Shout To The Horse” in which all the lyrics have been replaced with neighing. Hawking’s ghost added that he’s so afraid of Sex Christ that he spends most of his days hiding under a pile of laundry so the horse can’t find him, though the horse still often manages to track him down, having permanently affixed a vest of bells to Hawking so that he can always hear where he is. Hawking also stated that Sex Christ is fiercely anti-science and sits on him to punish him every time he catches him working on theories. The spectral Hawking concluded his message to the realm of the living by explaining that he wishes God were real instead of Sex Christ, because God would at least act according to a code of divine justice, while Sex Christ is a power-hungry horse whose actions are governed only by his own lunatic whims. While it’s unfortunate that the horse is so mean to Hawking’s ghost, it’s still incredibly exciting to finally have objective proof that God is just a fairy tale. Here’s hoping that things get better for Hawking in the afterlife and that he continues to share his discoveries with mankind."
"Nature Is Amazing: Researchers Have Discovered
That Elephants Experience Mourning When They Drop A Plate Of Nachos Facedown
On The Ground",N/A,https://clickhole.com/nature-is-amazing-researchers-have-discovered-that-ele-1830346887/,"Here’s some exciting science news that is sure to remind you just how awe-inspiring nature can be: Researchers have discovered that elephants experience mourning when they drop a plate of nachos facedown on the ground. Incredible! It just goes to show how extraordinary these animals truly are. The amazing phenomenon was recently discovered by a team of zoologists at Johns Hopkins University, who over the course of their study observed numerous instances of elephants expressing profound anguish and sadness after accidentally dropping a plate of nachos they were eating on the ground. The elephants were repeatedly documented gazing mournfully at their spilled nachos and tenderly nudging them with their trunks as if in denial that they were ruined, exhibiting an almost human-like level of emotional intelligence. “When an elephant drops nachos on the ground, its entire herd will join them in a 48-hour period of ritual grieving in which the distressed animals stomp in circles around the spilled chips and cry out in an eerie chorus of heartache, trumpeting desperately as if trying to bring the nachos back into existence,” said lead researcher Dr. Kristen Meeter, noting that even the elephant calves, who may not fully comprehend the loss, will nervously walk up to the nachos and smell them over and over again until they grasp the implications of what has happened, at which point they’ll then join their elders in bereavement. “Once the elephants finally accept that the nachos are gone, they’ll respectfully place tree branches and clumps of vegetation over the spilled chips and bid farewell.” “But they’ll often continue grieving over the nachos for months or even years later,” she added. “We observed one matriarch return to the site where she spilled some nachos over seven years after the fact, and she immediately collapsed to the dirt and began writhing around in anguish while the rest of her herd crowded around her and bellowed in remembrance.” The researchers noted that there does not seem to be any practical evolutionary purpose behind the elephants’ mourning, suggesting that the behavior is not driven by survival or necessity and rather is indicative of a deeper emotional bond with nachos that defies scientific explanation. Wow. It seems like humans may have more in common with elephants than we thought. Nature truly is amazing!"
"Coming Clean: Juicy Fruit Has Announced That The White Dust On Their Sticks Of Gum Is Regular-Ass Dust, And If That’s A Deal Breaker For You, They Understand",N/A,https://clickhole.com/coming-clean-juicy-fruit-has-announced-that-the-white-1830467110/,"In an age when genuine acts of corporate responsibility are few and far between, one of the biggest names in the gum industry just boldly opted to put its reputation on the line with a refreshingly transparent admission: Juicy Fruit has announced that the white dust on their sticks of gum is regular-ass dust, and if that’s a deal-breaker for you, they completely understand. Wow. This definitely isn’t going to help their bottom line at all, so kudos to Juicy Fruit for coming clean about the dust on their gum. For the 100-plus years that Juicy Fruit has been making chewing gum, the brand has stayed completely silent on what the white powder that coats each of their sticks of gum is, leaving customers to incorrectly assume that it’s some kind of sugar or preservative. Yet in a press statement released earlier today, Juicy Fruit revealed that the dust on their gum is just your basic, run-of-the-mill dust that comes from God-knows-where, and if knowing the truth makes you never want to chew Juicy Fruit again, they read you loud and clear. “At Juicy Fruit, we care very much for our customers, which is why we felt it was important to let everyone know that there’s an insane amount of regular-ass dust all over our sticks of gum,” said Juicy Fruit in the statement. “Until now, we never thought it was necessary to divulge this fact since the dust is pretty harmless and no one ever complained about it. But it’s occurred to us that maybe this is the kind of thing that people would like to know regardless, which is why we’ve decided to totally lay our cards on the table and say that the white stuff on Juicy Fruit is 100 percent the same kind of standard-ass dust that collects in big clumps on your hardwood floors or under your bed. We don’t know how the dust gets on the gum and we don’t know how to stop it from getting on the gum, so the unfortunate reality is that it’s here to stay. And if knowing the truth makes you want to stop buying Juicy Fruit, we completely understand. No hard feelings at all. We just wanted to give you a heads-up.” Damn. While this revelation certainly isn’t something to be excited about if you chew a lot of Juicy Fruit, you’ve got to commend the company for being honest and leveling with the public. Here’s hoping that Juicy Fruit is able to stay afloat despite the dust on their gum and that fans of their products won’t punish them for their candor."
Back For Seconds: Eddie Redmayne Just Announced That He’s Going To Start Acting Like He’s Paralyzed Again,N/A,https://clickhole.com/back-for-seconds-eddie-redmayne-just-announced-that-he-1829436651/,"Almost four years after winning Best Actor at the Academy Awards for his performance in The Theory Of Everything, it looks like the film’s leading man is ready for an encore: Eddie Redmayne just announced that he’s going to start acting like he’s paralyzed again. He’s back for seconds, folks! Saying that portraying wheelchair-bound physicist Stephen Hawking was one of the most fun and delightful experiences of his life, Redmayne revealed in a press conference earlier today that he intends to begin pretending like he has lost the ability to move his body and will likely never stop for the remainder of his life.  The 36-year-old actor explained that he greatly enjoyed taking on the character of a paralyzed individual, as he got to just sit there and relax while other people did all his work for him, making him feel as if he’d achieved the height of luxury. “They fed me, wheeled me around wherever I needed to go, took care of all my hygiene needs—it was like I was a sultan!” said Redmayne, adding that when he was acting like he was paralyzed there was a cool little computer on his wheelchair he got to look at whenever he wanted. “I got to basically hang out and do jack shit for six months, and then people gave me millions of dollars and lots of awards for it. How sweet is that? No one ever gave me an Oscar for using my legs, that’s for damn sure.” The actor went on to say that he’ll be ready to start acting paralyzed again very soon, having already purchased an electric wheelchair off of eBay and hired a team of around-the-clock nurses to attend to his needs. He plans to visit an indoor trampoline park at some point in the next couple of days to have one last hurrah with his legs, and after that he will then plop himself down in his wheelchair, where he’ll sit motionless for the next 40-plus years. Redmayne also noted that he has no intentions of retiring from acting and that moving forward he’ll only accept roles that don’t require him to move or talk. Wow! Kudos to Eddie for pursuing his dreams and doing what makes him happy. We can’t wait to see him wheeling around on the big screen sometime soon!"

This obituary was a major fail on the Times’ part, and it’s a good thing it’s taking responsibility for the mistake. “Thousands of readers have contacted us over the past 48 hours with complaints about our obituary for Stan Lee, which we understand failed to take into account his incredible accomplishments as a groundbreaking leader in the medium of comics, as well as inaccurately reported that Mr. Lee’s death was the result of his head abruptly sliding off of his body for no discernible reason,” wrote New York Times editor-in-chief Dean Paquet in an official statement published this morning. “Mr. Lee’s head is still stuck to his body, and on behalf of myself and the entire staff of the Times, I would like to offer a sincere apology for the oversights we made in our treatment of Stan Lee’s extraordinary, 95-year life. We hope Lee’s friends, family, and fans understand our deep regret at informing the public that his head fell off instead of writing about his life and legacy in greater detail.” Well, as embarrassing as this mistake may have been, it’s nice to see The New York Times admitting to it and offering an apology to its readers and Lee’s family. Let’s hope it makes up for it by publishing a more fitting tribute to the legendary editor-in-chief of Marvel Comics. Excelsior!"

Liberal Hypocrisy: MEDIA GORGON Rachel Maddow Is Criticizing Our Loyal President Even Though She IS THE PRESIDENT,N/A,https://clickhole.com/liberal-hypocrisy-media-gorgon-rachel-maddow-is-critic-1830409102/,"Liberal hypocrisy shows no signs of slowing down. The latest example of leftist double standards comes from MEDIA GORGON Rachel Maddow, who went on television yesterday to attack the president even though SHE IS THE PRESIDENT. Once again, the dem-o-craps prove they are COMPLETELY out of touch with reality. While delivering an unhinged rant on her POORLY RATED fake news show last night, TV HARPY Rachel Maddow slandered our BRAVE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF DONALD TRUMP by dishonestly accusing him of “criminal fraud” and “tax evasion,” all while conveniently failing to mention that she herself is currently the PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. Yep, it really doesn’t get more delusional than that. No matter what amazing things the president accomplishes, NEWS GHOUL Rachel Maddow is president and will pull out all the stops to attack the president simply for doing what voters elected her to do. But then suddenly, when the president is Rachel Maddow, then it’s wrong to be Maddow who is Rachel who is president? Sorry, liberals, but you can’t have it both ways. The facts are simple: Rachel Maddow is the PRESIDENT, she lives in the WHITE HOUSE, and the president is doing a GREAT JOB. But don’t expect Rachel Maddow to ever admit that, because at this point it’s clear the only thing the liberal mainstream media cares about is distorting the truth to make the president look bad. But despite the media’s lies, the reality is that, thanks to President Rachel Maddow, AMERICA IS BACK IN ACTION AND STRONGER THAN EVER! Our country is better than it ever was, but that doesn’t fit the biased narrative of PUNDIT DRACULA Rachel Maddow, who twists the truth to fit her ANTI-MADDOW AGENDA, proving yet again that THE MEDIA IS AN ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE. Clearly, it’s time for all true American patriots to STAND UP AND REJECT Rachel Maddow’s cowardly falsehoods about President Maddow. We must boycott MSNBC’S CROOKED FRANKENSTEIN Rachel Maddow and salute President Rachel Maddow to show that WE WILL NOT TOLERATE dangerous leftist propaganda!"
"Sorry: We’re Not Really Doing Lists With Sliders Anymore, So There’s No Way To Get These Photos Of Ron Perlman With Antlers Back To Normal",N/A,https://clickhole.com/sorry-we-re-not-really-doing-lists-with-sliders-anymor-1830025887/,"ClickHole would like to extend our sincerest apologies to Mr. Ron Perlman. We no longer publish lists containing the slider functionality that would help remove these antlers from his head in the following photos, so, unfortunately, they are here to stay. ClickHole’s longtime readers will remember the slider technology we once employed in pieces like this, this, this, this, this, and this. Back then, lists with sliders were shining examples of ClickHole’s fresh spin on aggregated listicles and viral news. But, as time went by, it became clear that sliders were taking up more time, energy, and staff resources than we could afford. We just no longer had the bandwidth to make them. So, unfortunately, we regret to inform both our readers and Mr. Ron Perlman that there is no way to remove the antlers from his head in this photo, and that’s just the way it is now. As nice as it would be to return Ron Perlman’s head to its natural, hornless state, sliders are a thing of the past for ClickHole, and they’ll likely remain so. Mr. Perlman will just have to accept that for the foreseeable future, nobody will be able to move a little bar back and forth across the screen to get rid of the antlers in this photograph. We apologize for the inconvenience. If it’s any consolation for the fact that we’ve quietly retired the slider format, ClickHole is of the opinion that Ron Perlman is still incredibly handsome with the majestic antlers of a 20-point buck. To the millions of ClickHole readers who flood our inbox every day demanding to know when we’re publishing more lists with sliders, we understand how devastating it must be to learn that you may never use a slider on ClickHole again. We wish we could give you a slider so that you could erase the dozens of antlers protruding from every inch of Ron Perlman’s head, but we’re simply powerless to do anything about it right now. Sorry, Ron. These antlers aren’t going anywhere without sliders, and to be completely honest with you, it doesn’t look like we’ll be doing those again anytime soon. You’re stuck with them. You have our deepest condolences."
Royal Baby Watch! Harry And Meghan Just Carved A Hole In The Side Of The PODS Container Where They Live Through Which Meghan Will Give Birth,N/A,https://clickhole.com/royal-baby-watch-harry-and-meghan-just-carved-a-hole-i-1830024017/,"Less than a month has passed since Prince Harry and Meghan Markle announced that they are expecting their first baby, but that hasn’t stopped the soon-to-be parents from making arrangements for the day their newborn arrives. As expected, the latest royal couple is about to enter the next phase of their lives together in utterly flawless fashion: Harry and Meghan just carved a hole in the side of the PODS container where they live through which Meghan will give birth! Perfection! You can bet the paparazzi will be climbing over each other for a chance to snap the first-ever photos of the new royal baby’s precious little legs dangling out the side of the PODS container where it will grow up. Yesterday, British tabloids caught footage of Harry and Meghan working together to saw a coffee-can-size hole from inside their PODS container home, using a variety of tools as part of the process, including a straight razor, an electric turkey carver, and eventually a handgun to shoot out any remaining rough edges around the circular opening. For those of us across the pond unfamiliar with royal tradition, Meghan has hand-selected this wall of the PODS container to drill a hole into and then give birth through, and once the baby has been pushed through the hole and onto the grass just outside the PODS container, Harry and Meghan will slowly pull their newborn child back into the storage unit by its umbilical cord.  Yup, the Duke and the Duchess of Sussex are truly getting the romantic, fairy-tale life that they deserve! After 56 hours of hard work drilling the hole, Harry and Meghan completed construction of the passage by testing whether a wild fox could squeeze into it—which one did, with ease—after which the red-haired prince put his arm around his loving wife and solemnly whispered to her, “As my brother, the queen, has always said, ‘If a fox can squeeze into it, then a human baby can squeeze out of it.’” Now that the royal birthing hole has passed the test, tradition dictates that it shall remain wreathed in garlands made of Chinese-takeout receipts and guarded by a Canadian Mountie until Meghan gives birth to her first child in the year 2032. The royal couple then held hands and waved to photographers through the birthing hole before pushing an eight-pack of paper-towel rolls out of it one by one to provide a soft landing for their child the day that Meghan’s son or daughter enters the world via the new perforation in their PODS container.  Yup, Harry and Meghan are parenting goals personified! Three more wild foxes just got into the PODS container. These two are truly living out their happily-ever-after together, and we’re so here for it. Could they be anymore perfect?! We’re already counting the days until Harry gets down on all fours and lets Meghan lay on his back as he lifts her up to the height of the hole in the side of the PODS container to give birth to the royal family’s next beautiful child. Congratulations again to Harry and Meghan!!!"
Incredible Breakthrough: Medical Researchers At Harvard Have Discovered A Way To Put A Dead Patient’s Brain In The Microwave While They Have Sex With Each Other On The Floor,N/A,https://clickhole.com/incredible-breakthrough-medical-researchers-at-harvard-1830027474/,"A group of scientists at one of America’s top universities just made an incredible breakthrough that will change the way doctors practice medicine forever. Medical researchers at Harvard University have discovered a way to put a dead patient’s brain in the microwave while they have sex with each other on the floor. This is amazing. What an extraordinary discovery! “After an extended study in which we replicated our results numerous times, we can now publicly announce that we have developed a method for doctors to take the brain of a deceased person out of their skull, place that brain in the microwave, and then start microwaving that brain for six hours while the doctors make love to each other right there on the ground,” lead researcher Dr. Jane Brundage said in a statement to the press. “I’m incredibly proud of our team of more than 40 scientists who have spent the past seven years microwaving brains and fucking each other as we strived to find a way to do both of those activities at the same time.” Brundage said she was also pleased to announce that when all the researchers are making love to each other on the ground, they can look up and see the brain in the microwave, spinning around like a pink, fleshy disco ball. She added that the sex feels fine to the researchers and makes them tired, and that when they open the microwave after six hours, the dead patient’s brain has often burst open and gotten all over the inside of the microwave, which is an unintended yet exciting breakthrough that has secured their team an additional $4.6 million grant from Harvard for continued study. The study has been extensively peer-reviewed, and scientists from top universities such as Johns Hopkins and Princeton report that they, too, have been able to cook dead people’s brains while having intercourse in numerous positions and with varying numbers of partners. Experts in the field say that such results are an important stepping stone toward future innovations, such as a method for a researcher to hold two dead people’s brains in each hand while using the toilet. Science is truly awesome! This is all incredibly exciting, and we can’t wait to see where this new discovery leads."
Letting His Baby Grow Up: God Has Finally Given Jesus Permission To Start Wearing A Thong,N/A,https://clickhole.com/letting-his-baby-grow-up-god-has-finally-given-jesus-p-1830026445/,"No matter how old your kids get, as a parent you’ll always feel an urge to protect them and safeguard their innocence. Yet there inevitably comes a time when every parent must learn to let their children grow up and make their own choices, and for the Creator of the Universe, it appears that time is now: God has reportedly finally given Jesus permission to start wearing a thong.  Talk about bittersweet. They grow up so fast, don’t they? After years of begging and pleading, sources say Jesus finally convinced God to let him start wearing thongs during a daddy-son lunch date earlier this week, arguing that, having lived for over 2,000 years and having shouldered the burden of mankind’s sins, he didn’t need to be babied anymore and could make his own choices about clothes. While God initially seemed resistant, saying that thongs were for strippers and Gomorrans and would look unbecoming on the Son of Man, he eventually gave in after Jesus tearfully revealed that angels had been bullying him for wearing granny panties, which filled the Almighty’s heart with great sorrow. God, wanting to tell all the nations of Heaven about his decision to let his only son wear a thong, then returned to his throne, raised Jesus high over his head, and issued a thunderous decree, his voice like that of a thousand trumpets. “I am the Alpha and Omega, the beginning and end, the first and the last,” declared the Most High with such tremendous power that the sun turned black, the moon became as blood, and armies of men instantly fell dead in their place. “And this is my only son, Jesus, whom I love, and with whom I am well-pleased. Let all ye that hath an ear know on this day that Jesus shall have his first thong, for he hath conquered the grave at Calvary and thus deserveth to wear the undergarment of his choosing. Let all of creation rejoice!” Shortly after making his declaration, God took Jesus thong-shopping at the mall, where Jesus ultimately settled on a cute pink thong from Justice that he really liked. Once home, Jesus excitedly tried on the thong and spent hours marveling in the mirror at how he had no visible panty lines, and while it delighted God to see how happy his child was, it also saddened him to see his little baby boy looking so grown up—the same little boy who it seemed like just yesterday had been taking his first steps, saying his first words, and using his powers to make a pile of fish appear out of thin air for the first time. Being omniscient, God always knew deep down that this day would come, but nothing can really prepare you for the moment when you realize that your baby’s not a baby anymore. God sighed and went off to take a nap. Meanwhile, Jesus, eager to flaunt his new undies, strutted out into Heaven wearing a pair of low-rise jeans that, when he bent over, would “accidentally” expose his thong to passersby. Unfortunately, his eagerness would soon turn to shame and despair, as the first heavenly creatures he encountered were a group of snickering thousand-eyed beasts who, titillated by a glimpse of the Messiah’s thong, ballooned tenfold with lust and started chanting, “Slutty, slutty, slutty is the son of God Almighty,” over and over again, swelling larger and larger by the second, until the internal pressure of their horniness could no longer be contained and immense clouds of locusts erupted forth from each of their genital slits, engulfing our Savior in a dense swarm of bugs. Horrified, Jesus burst into tears and ran home. Crying hysterically, Jesus told God about the incident, but God just shook his head coldly and said, “See, I knew this would happen, and this is exactly why I didn’t want you wearing a thong.” The insensitive comment was overheard by God’s wife, a living pillar of fire with lips, who then came to Jesus’ defense and said that Jesus shouldn’t let the actions of a few piggish immortal beasts dictate what he wears. As God and his wife then got into a heated argument, God’s slave, former first lady Barbara Bush, took the heartbroken Jesus upstairs and drew him a warm bath and stroked his hair until he calmed down. Damn. While it’s definitely upsetting that things took such an ugly turn, here’s hoping that Jesus won’t let the cruel words of some monsters keep him from confidently rocking his new thong. Flaunt it, J! You do you!"

Not sure why Buzz waited so long to reveal this tidbit, but still good to know! “I don’t know if this will be of interest to anyone, but just thought I’d share that I saw a fox when I was on the moon,” said Aldrin in a statement to the press, albeit five decades too late. “Neil [Armstrong] and I were out there collecting rock samples when, about 15 yards off in the distance, I saw a small fox sniffing and digging around in the lunar soil. It locked eyes with me for a second and then darted off into a crater.” “I remember thinking that I ought to grab the camera to get a quick picture of it,” Aldrin continued. “But I got sidetracked with other mission tasks and then later completely forgot to report it in the research log.” Aldrin went on to say that he considered telling people about the fox numerous times over the years, but he never felt it was particularly noteworthy, adding that the fox was “just a normal, unremarkable fox, exactly like the ones on Earth.” He noted that, had it been some type of strange alien life form and not just a plain garden-variety fox, then he likely would’ve told people about it sooner. While it would’ve been great to have known about the fox way back in 1969, it’s definitely still cool to hear about it now. Better late than never!"
Movie Fans Rejoice! Maggie Smith Has Signed On To Play The Role Of Elderly Kermit The Frog In An Upcoming Susan B. Anthony Biopic!,N/A,https://clickhole.com/movie-fans-rejoice-maggie-smith-has-signed-on-to-play-1830028109/,"Movie fans, brace yourselves, because there’s some news coming out of Hollywood that is going to make your day: It’s just been confirmed that Maggie Smith has signed on to play the role of Elderly Kermit the Frog in an upcoming Susan B. Anthony biopic! Just yes! This Susan B. Anthony biopic is going to be completely awesome! “We’re so excited to have an actress as accomplished as Maggie Smith onboard to portray the 120-year-old version of Kermit the Frog as we bring the events of Susan B. Anthony’s amazing life to the big screen,” said the film’s director, Hulk Hogan, who also choreographed the movie’s wrestling scenes. “When I watch Maggie perform her scenes, it’s like I’m watching the real Kermit the Frog picket for women’s suffrage or lift Susan B. Anthony up over his head while complaining that 120 years old is too old for a frog to live and that he should have died when he was 13.” The movie is due out early next year from 20th Century Fox, and Maggie Smith is just one incredible addition to an already amazing cast. The legendary Meryl Streep has signed on to play Susan B. Anthony herself, Oscar winner Patricia Arquette will play her close friend and fellow suffragette Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and Emma Stone has agreed to play Young Kermit the Frog in several crucial flashback scenes. A star-studded cast like this is sure to do justice to Susan B. Anthony’s life and work! To preserve historical accuracy, the film will also shoot on location in Susan B. Anthony’s hometown of Adams, MA, and many of Maggie Smith’s scenes as Elderly Kermit the Frog will take place in the actual church in St. Louis where Kermit and Susan B. Anthony met to discuss women’s rights and take turns electrocuting each other in the world’s very first electric chair. No doubt about it, this movie’s gearing up to become an all-time classic. Susan B. Anthony had a complex life filled with nuances and contradictions, but with an actress like Maggie Smith playing a role as crucial as Kermit the Frog, we have a feeling it’s going to be a film worth watching for years to come!"

Hot Hot Hollywood: Armie Hammer Has Removed His Toupee In Church And Is Using The Severed Leg Of A Flamingo To Push It Toward A Scared Little Boy,N/A,https://clickhole.com/hot-hot-hollywood-armie-hammer-has-removed-his-toupee-1829588651/,"A hot new celebrity sighting is getting splattered all over the tabloids and it’s got absolutely everyone talking: According to gossip and beautiful paparazzi photos, movie star heart throb Armie Hammer has removed his toupee in church and is using the severed leg of a flamingo to push it across the floor toward a scared little boy! Famous people, ahoy! The glitz and glamour of Hot Hot Hollywood has erupted onto the front pages once again! According to Hollywood insiders, the priest in Armie Hammer’s Beverly Hills church had just begun a sermon on the dangers of greed when Armie Hammer spotted a small boy attending church with his parents on the other side of the aisle. That’s when the A-list Oscar nominee slowly peeled his toupee off of his head, put it on the ground, and began pushing his Hollywood hairpiece toward the boy with a severed leg taken from a majestic flamingo (Hollywood bird). The boy’s eyes grew wide with fear as he watched Armie Hammer’s toupee approach him slowly like a rodent, and according to paparazzi everywhere, the toupee is only getting closer to the boy with each passing moment!  The whole affair is glamorous beyond measure! Now this is why Hollywood is where they have the Hollywood sign! It just doesn’t get more famous than this! Armie Hammer’s bald head is gleaming in the sunlight passing through the stained glass windows of the chapel, and he is making eye contact with the boy without blinking and mouthing the words, “Call my wig by your name! My wig stole your name!” to the boy as he uses his bird leg to push the toupee closer and closer. The boy is tugging on his mom’s dress to try to get her to see this sparkling spectacle, but she is too busy listening to the priest talk about how avarice leads the soul to ruin!   Many big-name movie producers close to the story say that Armie Hammer won the flamingo leg at a raffle! Every few seconds he stops pushing the toupee toward the boy and instead uses the flamingo leg to point at the boy and mouth the words, “My wig wants to live with you!” which is making the boy confused and terrified in the awesome way that only a total A-lister like Armie Hammer can! It’s amazing to get yet another glimpse into the exclusive, ritzy world of the Hollywood celeb! The latest gossip from inside the church is that Armie Hammer’s now slapping his bald head with his free hand and he has almost pushed his toupee all the way to the frightened boy. Nobody else in the church knows this is happening because the sermon is so interesting!  This is definitely the juiciest gossip we’ve ever learned about, and you can keep it right here on this website to keep learning more about Armie Hammer’s glitzy decision to push his toupee toward a religious boy with the leg of a Hollywood Pigeon (flamingo)!

"Awesome! Koala Kare Has Announced That If There Are Any Adults Out There Who Want To Lie Down On Its Baby-Changing Tables And Change Their Pants, Then Have At It",N/A,https://clickhole.com/awesome-koala-kare-has-announced-that-if-there-are-any-1829910107/,"If you’re not the parent of a toddler, then baby-changing tables probably aren’t a part of your day-to-day routine, but that might be set to change: Koala Kare just announced that if there are any adults out there who want to lie down on its baby changing tables and change their pants, then they can have at it. Um, yeah, it’s official: This is about as big as it gets!  For as long as Koala Kare has been manufacturing its changing stations, the strict 0 to 3 age policy printed on each table’s warning label has completely boxed out any adults who might like to climb up there themselves and lie on their backs while they slip into some fresh pants, but it looks like those days are over. “We’re proud to announce that if any adults out there have been waiting for the green light to climb aboard our little fold-out changing tables, stretch their legs out over the edge, and slide into a pair of jeans or chinos that they brought into the bathroom with them, they can go right ahead, ” Koala Kare CEO Michael Woods said in a press conference today. “It’s honestly pretty rare to walk into a mall bathroom and see someone changing a baby, which means our tables are just sitting there unused most of the time, so by all means, if you’re an adult and you see an available Koala Kare station, go ahead and lie down, pull off your old pants, and pull up your new ones. No problem at all.” So. Awesome. Koala Kare just gave the greatest gift imaginable to every adult out there who’d like to change their pants in public but need to be lying down to do it. Be sure to sound off in the comments if you’re planning on taking advantage of this amazing opportunity!"
Owning Up: The American Medical Association Has Apologized For Still Not Having A More Legitimate-Looking Alternative To Pushing On Your Tongue With A Wood Stick,N/A,https://clickhole.com/owning-up-the-american-medical-association-has-apologi-1829782832/,"It’s pretty rare to see an organization take responsibility and own up to its mistakes these days, which makes this latest bit of news so refreshing: The American Medical Association has apologized for still not having a more legitimate-looking alternative to pushing on your tongue with a wood stick. It looks like the AMA is honest enough to own up to its shortcomings. “That the AMA has somehow made it to the year 2018 and still not come up with a more sophisticated diagnostic procedure than sticking a wooden stick into a patient’s mouth like some kind of prairie doctor from the 1800s is shameful and not at all in line with our mission to advance medical technology and the public health,” said AMA representative Dr. Paul Chen in a press statement earlier today. “Jamming a popsicle stick into someone’s mouth and making them say ‘ahhh’ is something you’d expect to see in an old Donald Duck cartoon and we sincerely apologize that the medical field has failed to innovate something better by now.”  The AMA’s statement goes on to express remorse that doctors have not yet developed some type of expensive machine to check patients’ throats that plugs into the wall and has lights on it and a few buttons that would communicate professionalism and competence. Needless to say, the fact that the American Medical Association is willing to admit that it can do better is awesome and much needed in today’s culture. Hopefully medical researchers can invent a throat test that looks like actual science sometime soon!"
"Body Positivity Fail: Aerie Has Apologized After Putting Out A Modeling Casting Call For ‘The Most Heinous, Bizarre-Looking Women Imaginable’",N/A,https://clickhole.com/body-positivity-fail-aerie-has-apologized-after-puttin-1829589554/,"The body positivity movement continues to inspire self-love and acceptance in a society full of impossible beauty standards, but one company’s efforts to celebrate bodies of all shapes and sizes just went seriously awry: Aerie has apologized after putting out a modeling casting call for “the most heinous, bizarre-looking women imaginable.” Yikes. This definitely sends the wrong message about body positivity. While Aerie has drawn praise in the past for the inclusion of nontraditional body types in their advertisements, the lingerie brand seemed to overplay their hand yesterday when it posted a casting call seeking out “the most, heinous, bizarre-looking women imaginable” to pose for its summer 2018 body positivity campaign. The listing immediately drew a public outcry from people offended by Aerie’s stated desire to find “wonky-looking women with weird-ass features” so the company can be “the first to ever tell these freaks that they’re beautiful.” To its credit, Aerie quickly took responsibility for the misstep and issued an official apology today on its website: We would like to express our sincere regret for the modeling casting call we released yesterday asking for “heinous, bizarre-looking women,” which upon review does not meet Aerie’s mission of inclusivity. While our goal was to make women who exist outside of the media’s narrow definition of beauty feel confident and appreciated, we now realize that asking for “total bottom-of-the-barrel girls” to model our swimwear does not accomplish that. At the time, we wrongfully believed that our request for models with “bulging cartoon eyes and towering slabs of forehead” would lead to an empowering moment of representation, but we can now see that referring to women as “lurching piles of misshapen parts” is in no way uplifting, and we deeply apologize for the hurt we have caused.” Wow. While a judgment error like this will be hard to bounce back from, we’re impressed that Aerie owned up and apologized. Here’s hoping Aerie learned its lesson about how not to do body positivity and won’t make any more mistakes like this in the future."
Her Rightful Place: Mother Teresa Has Finally Ascended To Heaven After Serving Her Due Penance In Purgatory For Illegally Torrenting ‘Mrs. Doubtfire’,N/A,https://clickhole.com/her-rightful-place-mother-teresa-has-finally-ascended-1829852454/,"It’s incredibly heartbreaking that despite dedicating her life to humanitarian service for the sick and the poor, Mother Teresa’s sins have prevented her from crossing through the shimmering gates of Heaven since her death in 1997. Fortunately, the news we’ve got today is going to make you stand up and cheer: Mother Teresa has finally ascended to Heaven after serving her due penance in purgatory for illegally torrenting Mrs. Doubtfire. Yes! At long last Mother Teresa has claimed her rightful spot in paradise. Early this morning, after spending the last 21 years suffering in torment and praying for God’s divine mercy to deliver her from her sin of pirating Mrs. Doubtfire in 1996, Mother Teresa ascended to Heaven at last and assumed the seat in the afterlife she was always meant to hold. Atoning for her evil decision to torrent the 1993 Robin Williams classic required that she make herself meek before the endless flame, but thanks to her unrelenting spirit and pursuit of forgiveness, the Heavenly Father forgave her and emerged from the fires after two decades with a purified soul and newfound understanding that when you choose to watch a copyrighted film, you need to follow the law and purchase it just like everyone else, lest you face the divine wrath of God. This is absolutely wonderful news. It was such a shame that downloading a 2GB file called “Doubtifre_MRS.anonymous” from an internet message board prevented someone as selfless and pious as Mother Teresa from attaining the Kingdom of God after her death, but it’s so awesome to know that her penance has been completed and she’ll be happily basking in Heaven’s glory for all eternity. Congrats, Mother Teresa! May Heaven be everything you’ve ever dreamed of."
Huge Win: Norway Has Reduced All Of Its Numbers By 97%,N/A,https://clickhole.com/huge-win-norway-has-reduced-all-of-its-numbers-by-97-1829297598/,"As if universal healthcare, low crime rates, and high happiness levels weren’t reason enough to move to Norway, the Scandinavian country has just left pretty much every other nation in the dust in possibly the most significant way yet: Norway has managed to reduce all of its numbers by a whopping 97 percent. Um, time to apply for Norwegian citizenship, like, right now! At a time when numbers in most other countries are at an all-time high, Norway has managed to shrink even some of its most massive numbers down to next to nothing. Brilliantly, it’s managed to reduce things like dog attacks and swimming from 92 to 2.76. Forest fires, public transportation, and the ocean have all decreased from 17 to 0.51, and many things that used to be 138 are now 4.14.  In the U.S., the numbers can get into the thousands, but in Norway, thanks to the country’s consistent efforts, most of the numbers have shrunk to close to 0.  Let that sink in for a minute. The rest of the world looks pretty backwards compared to Norway right about now. Norway’s incredible number reduction should give hope for every nation whose numbers are way too high. The statistics don’t lie: Recent stats show that Norway is currently at 19, compared to Sweden’s 261, Brazil’s 927.5, and the U.S.’s whopping 65,012. If Norway can pull it off, there’s really no reason for any nation to continue to have large numbers like 179,481, when they could follow Norway’s lead and get them down to smaller alternatives, such as 6.  No matter what your political beliefs, everyone can agree that if numbers can be made smaller, they should be. By reducing all of its numbers so drastically, Norway has set an example for the rest of the international community to follow. It’s pretty inspiring!"
A Tragic Loss: 6 Astronauts On The International Space Station Have Died While Attempting To Wear Witch Costumes In Space For Halloween,N/A,https://clickhole.com/a-tragic-loss-6-astronauts-on-the-international-space-1829847717/,"Millions are in mourning today following a deadly Halloween-related incident that claimed the lives of some of the world’s bravest and most accomplished space explorers: Officials have confirmed that six astronauts on board the International Space Station died today after attempting to wear witch costumes in space to celebrate Halloween. This is a truly devastating loss. Our hearts go out to the friends and loved ones of these courageous astronauts whose love for Halloween ended up costing them their lives. The tragedy occurred early this morning when astronaut Lt. Stewart McPherson began a live webcam stream in which he appeared with five other astronauts all wearing witch costumes. Lt. McPherson looked into the camera and said, “Happy Halloween from all of us evil witches on the International Space Station! Now we shall fly into outer space and do the Devil’s bidding!” The six astronauts then all started doing a high-pitched cackle before they opened the airlock and leaped into space screaming, “Fly, my evil brethren, fly!” Within moments of exiting the airlock, the astronauts were all floating lifelessly in space dressed in the pointed hats and robes they had purchased from Party City before they left Earth. Approximately three minutes later a sixth astronaut jumped out of the airlock in a witch’s costume even though she could clearly see her five colleagues floating dead right in front of her. She passed away moments later. The astronauts had also brought broomsticks with them as they left the space station so that they could float around on them in zero-gravity as though they were real witches, which officials say would have been a “truly spooky trick” had the astronauts not suffocated in the vacuum of space before they got a chance to pull it off. A rescue shuttle was swiftly dispatched to the ISS to retrieve the bodies of the six scary astronauts, but sadly the four astronauts aboard this second spacecraft were also celebrating Halloween and went into space all dressed as Michael Myers from the Halloween movie franchise. Within moments these astronauts were also dead, and now NASA is left trying to figure out how to retrieve the corpses of the six witches and four Michael Myers that are drifting together outside the space station. This is absolutely heartbreaking. It’s safe to say that this is the saddest Halloween in the history of space travel. Hopefully next year the ISS astronauts can pull off a fun Halloween scare without anyone dying!"
"Dangerous Knowledge:
Jerry Seinfeld Has Gone Insane After Attaining Complete Understanding
Of The Deal With Dry Cleaning",N/A,https://clickhole.com/dangerous-knowledge-jerry-seinfeld-has-gone-insane-aft-1829439776/,"There are some truths that are best left unknown, horrific secrets that will shatter any mind that dares to learn them, and, tragically, one of the world’s most beloved comedians has precipitated his own undoing in pursuit of such forbidden knowledge: Jerry Seinfeld has gone completely insane after attaining full understanding of the deal with dry cleaning. That poor fool! You really hate to see something like this happen. After years of wondering about how dry cleaning works, Seinfeld recently ventured into a library and searched through dark and mildewing shelves of the reference section until he found an accursed book about industrial garment care. As he read the ancient tome, the hapless stand-up’s eyes widened in shock and tears streamed down his face while his mouth formed into a rictus grin of horrified delight. Hours later he put down the book and maniacally cackled, “I understand the deal now. I understand the deal with dry cleaning!” Upon returning home, Seinfeld was a changed man from his usual jovial self. He began writing on the walls of his mansion in red pen, spending days without sleep scrawling the arcane methods behind dry cleaning on every available surface. Over the subsequent weeks Seinfeld’s hair grew unkempt, his nails long and yellow, but his clothing appeared cleaner than ever. Worried family and friends tried to talk to the unhinged celeb, but all they could get out of Seinfeld were maddened nonsensical explanations about how dry cleaning isn’t actually dry, despite not using water. The final straw was an appearance Seinfeld made at the Comedy Cellar in New York, where instead of performing his usual tight five, he walked onstage and uttered the deal with dry cleaning. “Dry cleaning. Ever wonder about that?” began the comic. “Two words that completely contradict each other. To clean something, you must get it wet. Or must thou? Until now, its deal was shrouded in secrecy, but no more. I have unraveled the paradox of dry cleaning. I comprehend its whole deal. You, too, will be awakened to the deal, as I have been.” Seinfeld then spoke the deal with dry cleaning, causing everyone in the audience to go insane. Many comedy fans stabbed out their eyes and ears with pens to avoid learning more of the deal with dry cleaning. Others ran out into the street to throw themselves into oncoming traffic and end their suffering. The truly unlucky Seinfeld fans sitting in the first row, who heard more of the deal with dry cleaning than others, are now trapped in a catatonic state, staring blankly into space, unable to move or say anything beyond “dry cleaning.” For public safety, the legendary funnyman was committed to an asylum for life, and locked in a padded room. Seinfeld is now being forced to wear a straitjacket and muzzle to stop him from writing or talking so that the deal with dry cleaning cannot be spread to another victim and destroy their sanity—a horrible yet necessary protective measure. What a devastating tragedy, beget from Jerry Seinfeld’s hubris! While this is an incredibly unfortunate outcome for both Seinfeld and fans of comedy, here’s hoping that the Bee Movie actor’s self-inflicted downfall will serve as a cautionary tale to prevent others from making similar mistakes in the future."
"Incredible: Linguists Have Finally Uncovered The English Meaning Of The Phrase ‘Sayonara, Suckers’",N/A,https://clickhole.com/incredible-linguists-have-finally-uncovered-the-englis-1829874765/,"This fascinating development is a must-read for anyone interested in decoding the mysteries of human language: Linguists have finally uncovered the English meaning of the phrase “Sayonara, suckers.” Wow. It is beyond exciting to see a puzzle like this one solved at long last. There’s no telling what doors of understanding this will open for linguists across the globe! A research group in the linguistics department at the University of Pennsylvania had been working to decipher the meaning of “Sayonara, suckers” for several years before reaching a breakthrough earlier this week. “After cross-referencing early Latin texts with modern-day slang and transliterating various Japanese characters into English syllables, we’ve come to the conclusion that the once-mysterious phrase means something like ‘goodbye,’ but with a tone of disrespect,” explained lead researcher Helen Greenwald. “Written sources we recently uncovered helped us ascertain that “Sayonara, suckers” is usually intended as a type of parting pleasantry that one might use while riding away on a motorcycle after having triumphed over two or more people.” Amazing. This is an incredible discovery that can only mean good things for those of us trying to better understand language’s impact on the world and how we communicate with each other. You might never have known the meaning behind the phrase “Sayonara, suckers” before, but if you come upon it now, you’ll know exactly how to react. Human knowledge truly is limitless!"
Extremely Brave: Strong President Donald Trump Is Courageously Sitting On His Toilet In A Gas Mask While The White House Gets Fumigated,N/A,https://clickhole.com/extremely-brave-strong-president-donald-trump-is-coura-1830033138/,"Once again, our flawless and incredibly wealthy and handsome President Donald John Trump has proven that he is the bravest man in the world. As we speak, strong President Donald Trump is courageously sitting on his toilet in a gas mask while the White House gets fumigated. Another day, another act of unsurpassed courage from our glistening President Trump! Not even poisonous gas can keep our powerful president from using the toilet he loves! “Although President Trump was repeatedly warned that the White House was getting pumped full of poisonous fumes as part of a routine pest control procedure, he simply responded, ‘Nobody tells me where to shit,’ before venturing into the noxious environment so he could defecate in his normal toilet,” White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters this morning, adding that she was very proud of our billionaire president as exterminators continued to fill the White House with pesticides behind her. “While many presidents, like cowardly Obama, would be too afraid to use the White House bathroom under these circumstances, President Trump was strong and rich enough to do it, and he’ll probably be in there for another couple of hours.” As you read these words, it is mandatory that you stand up and salute your computer, because President Donald John Trump is sitting on his toilet in a cloud of poison, just like Superman! White House sources have also confirmed that at one point during his toilet conquest, President Trump stood up and wandered with his pants down through the haze of poisonous gas clouding the empty halls of the White House while still wearing his gas mask. Then, much like the alpha male Rambo would probably do, President Trump wandered back to the bathroom and resumed using the toilet, but even harder. Libtards take note: This is the way that masculine presidents show the world that America is the strongest nation on Earth. When all the bugs and mice in the White House are finally dead and the building is cleared of the toxic fumes, President Donald John Trump will remain, seated on the toilet in his gas mask, basking in his glorious victory. All real Americans should be sure to wish President Trump godspeed as he continues his heroic bowel movement today!"
"Beautiful! Habitat For Humanity Just Committed To Building 5,000 Haunted Houses In America’s Poorest Regions This October",N/A,https://clickhole.com/beautiful-habitat-for-humanity-just-committed-to-build-1829910059/,"Prepare to have your faith in humanity restored, because one of our country’s most generous nonprofits is doing something truly amazing for the less fortunate: Habitat for Humanity just committed to building 5,000 haunted houses in America’s poorest regions just in time for Halloween. Beautiful! It’s great to see people recognizing spooktacular thrills and chills as an essential human right. For millions of Americans, poverty means going without basic necessities that the rest of us take for granted, but Habitat for Humanity just vowed to give these people the bone-chilling Halloween scares they deserve by constructing 5,000 new haunted houses in the country’s most underprivileged communities by the end of the month. In an announcement this morning, Habitat detailed its ambitious plan to mobilize several hundred teams of volunteers and professional builders to construct haunted houses fully equipped with eerie, winding corridors, ambience-enhancing fog machines, and no fewer than 10 jump-scares per location. Even with volunteer labor, the endeavor will cost in the tens of millions of dollars, but considering how many needy Americans will finally have somewhere they can go to be spooked by cackling skeletons and howled at by an actor in a wolfman costume, those millions will be money well spent. “From cauldrons full of dry ice to gurneys strewn with hyper-realistic guts, these haunted houses will have all the amenities necessary to provide heart-pounding horror to the Americans who need it most,” said Habitat for Humanity CEO Jonathan Reckford in a press statement. “One in five Americans don’t know where their next Halloween frightfest will come from, and it’s important that we do everything we can to change that.” The effort is also getting a helping hand from former U.S. President and longtime Habitat proponent Jimmy Carter, who has personally recorded an hour-long ambient track featuring sound effects of dragging chains, creaking doors, and hair-raising shrieks to be played on loop over the loudspeakers at the haunted houses. Habitat is even going so far as to truck in fresh groceries to the haunted houses being built in food deserts to ensure that food-insecure neighborhoods will have the pasta and peeled grapes necessary to display bowls full of monster brains and eyeballs. It warms your heart to see so many people taking time out of their busy schedules to build haunted houses for those in need. Bravo, Habitat for Humanity! Your amazing work here will change millions of people’s Halloweens for the better."
Personal Transformation: The Entertainer Formerly Known As Cedric Has Changed His Name To The Bluetooth Symbol,N/A,https://clickhole.com/personal-transformation-the-entertainer-formerly-known-1829823764/,"It’s always fascinating to watch artists reinvent themselves, but this performer may have just had one of the boldest personal transformations that pop culture has seen yet: The Entertainer Formerly Known As Cedric has changed his name to the Bluetooth symbol. Wow. This is definitely an incredible step in the artistic evolution of The Entertainer Formerly Known As Cedric. In a press release earlier this morning, The Entertainer Formerly Known As Cedric’s publicist announced that her client has legally changed his name to the Bluetooth corporate trademark and respectfully asks to be referred to as such in print journalism, personal appearances, and on-screen credits.  Ladies and gentleman, Cedric The Entertainer is no more. Now Cedric The Entertainer’s name is this: The bold name change comes from The Entertainer Formerly Known As Cedric’s desire to make an explicit distinction between his past body of work and this completely new era performing under the moniker of the Bluetooth symbol, an abstract emblem which he believes to embody the “mysterious and cosmic comedy that has long been a signature component of [his] public persona.” Simply incredible. This is a performer who trusts his creative instincts, no matter the risk. Congratulations to The Entertainer Formerly Known As Cedric on his new name, and kudos to him for not being afraid to take this bold artistic risk!"
Ah Jeez: This Kid’s Family Is Making Everyone At His Sleepover Say Grace Before Eating Little Caesars,N/A,https://clickhole.com/ah-jeez-this-kid-s-family-is-making-everyone-at-his-sl-1829624956/,"Things definitely just got weird for the group of 9-year-olds who were enjoying what was, up until this point, an all-around fun and normal sleepover at Zach Olsen’s house: According to sources, Zach’s parents are making everyone at his sleepover say grace before eating Little Caesars. Woof. Is it really necessary to ask for God’s blessing on a couple of $5 Hot-N-Readys? After spending the previous four hours playing Fortnite and goofing off in the basement, moments ago the six attendees of Zach’s sleepover bolted upstairs for dinner, ready to dig into the pizzas Mrs. Olsen brought home from Little Caesars. But just when the kids were about to start stuffing their faces, Zach’s dad took his wife’s hand and bowed his head, signaling that apparently they’re the kind of family that prays before meals, even meals at sleepovers, and that they expect everyone to participate. After several moments of uncomfortable silence, the boys followed suit and bowed their heads, joining in on a solemn religious ritual when literally just five minutes prior they were trying to make themselves fart on command in the basement. And if you thought they’d just say grace super quick as a formality, think again. The prayer’s already been going for a good 45 seconds, and Zach’s dad just got a little quiver in his voice as he asked God to bless the food to the nourishment of the boys’ bodies, which definitely seems a bit overkill for a dinner of cheap pepperoni pizza and a two-liter of caffeine-free Mountain Dew, especially considering that all these kids want to do is eat as fast as they can so they can go back to the basement and play Grand Theft Auto V or maybe watch an R-rated movie with boobs in it. The good news is that they’re at least in the privacy of a home and not at a restaurant, because Zach’s family is no doubt the kind that joins hands and prays out loud right in the middle of Olive Garden, making everyone at all the other tables feel super weird. Yikes. This truly is one of the last things you ever want to happen at a sleepover. Here’s hoping that the prayer wraps up soon so that the kids can just eat their food and get back to dicking around in the basement. "
Hard-Hitting Journalism: A 7-Year Joint Investigation Between ‘The New York Times’ And Kevin Hart Has Found That Women Take Too Long To Put On Makeup,N/A,https://clickhole.com/hard-hitting-journalism-a-7-year-joint-investigation-b-1829624935/,"A groundbreaking work of journalism was just published that’s quickly taken the internet by storm. A joint investigation by The New York Times and stand-up comedian Kevin Hart has found that women take too long to put on makeup. This is courageous, world-class reporting from Kevin Hart and the paper of record. According to Hart’s investigation, which pulled from interviews with hundreds of sources, women will often tell their husbands that they only need five minutes to put on makeup, but they must be looking at some sort of special clock just for women because when they say “five minutes,” they really mean “anywhere between one hour and never.” “Over the past seven years I have spoken to hundreds of husbands who are hungry and waiting for their wives to get their makeup on, because it’s dinnertime and they were supposed to leave a long time ago,” wrote Hart in the story, which appeared on the front page of the Times today. “The harsh reality is that women take so long to get ready for dinner you have to wonder if they brought snacks up there or something. It’s like when you say, ‘Let’s go eat dinner at 7,’ she just hears, ‘Start doing your hair up around 7:15 and then take as long as you want.’ And somehow we still get to the restaurant the same time as our friends! Are the women coordinating?” One of the most shocking pieces of data Hart’s article revealed is that the five words that a man absolutely never wants to hear from his girlfriend are, “Let me do my makeup,” because when men hear those five words, the night’s over. They’re done. Their house just became a prison where time has no meaning. Hart writes that based on his data, if you’re a man who hears those five words, you should just call up your friends and tell them you’ll see them tomorrow. Absolutely amazing. In an era when most news outlets seem focused on getting clicks with puff-piece journalism, you’ve got to give it up to Kevin Hart and The New York Times for putting in the work to alert the world to the harsh truth that when your girlfriend or wife says she’s going to put on her makeup, she might as well have told you she was about to do a 10,000-piece jigsaw puzzle. Now more than ever, this is the kind of hard-hitting journalism we need!"
Exciting: The Surgeon General Is Holding A Lottery To Exempt One Lucky Pregnant Woman From His Smoking Warning,N/A,https://clickhole.com/exciting-the-surgeon-general-is-holding-a-lottery-to-e-1829585027/,"If you’re an expectant mother, get excited, because here’s an incredible new opportunity that could make your pregnancy a lot more fun: The U.S. surgeon general just announced that he is holding a lottery to exempt one lucky pregnant woman from his smoking warning. Awesome! Starting today, pregnant women can enter the lottery by submitting their name and contact information to the Department of Health, where the winner, selected at random by U.S. Surgeon General Jerome M. Adams, will receive total exemption from the pregnancy-related health warnings included on tobacco products sold in the United States. The winner will be officially granted permission to ignore any language on cigarette labels about risks that smoking poses to unborn children, such as low birth weight, congenital heart problems, and birth defects, allowing her to smoke as much as she wants, guilt-free, until giving birth. “As the U.S. surgeon general, I will turn a blind eye to the winner’s tobacco use throughout the duration of her pregnancy and allow her to smoke as much as she sees fit, completely exempting her from my public health warnings,” announced Surgeon General Adams in a press release. “For all I care, the winner can puff through a carton of Marlboros every single day right up to her due date. I won’t say a word. Despite urging every other American to consider the health hazards of smoking while pregnant, I will not pass any judgment on the winner for smoking, no matter what trimester they are in or what happens to their pregnancy as a result of their nicotine intake. Enter now!” Cool! With 3.3 million women currently carrying a child in the U.S., the odds of winning the sweepstakes are definitely small, but hey, you never know! Each woman has an equal chance of having her name drawn, so if you’re pregnant, you might as well throw your name in the hat and try your luck, because this is definitely a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

"Righting
Wrongs: Subway’s New Spokesperson Is A Man Who Gained 300 Pounds Eating Its Sandwiches And Also Has No Plans To Act On His Lust For Children",N/A,https://clickhole.com/righting-wrongs-subway-s-new-spokesperson-is-a-man-who-1829838962/,"Subway has long been recovering from the PR nightmare of Jared Fogle being unmasked as a pedophile, but it looks like now it’s finally turning a corner. Today the restaurant chain took a huge step in the right direction by introducing a new spokesperson who gained 300 pounds eating its sandwiches and will also never act on his lust for young children. By hiring what appears to be the polar opposite of Jared Fogle, Subway is showing that it’s definitely serious about righting past wrongs. Making his debut appearance in a commercial that will air nationwide starting today, the new enormous spokesman holds up a pair of his old small pants that are now far too tiny for him to wear and says, “Hi, Subway sandwiches made me gain 300 pounds, and I have never molested a child. Eating 12 inches of bread, cheese, and meat every meal has caused me to become morbidly obese, and I only seek out pornography featuring performers who are a minimum of 18 years old. Thank you.” The spokesman then shows the camera some magazines from his pornography collection to prove he isn’t lying. Wow, what a powerful message—and one that’s definitely going to win back customers’ trust. “We’re pleased to start featuring a new spokesperson in our commercials, an inspirational Subway customer who really ballooned up thanks to our food, who has also vowed to never indulge in statutory rape or human trafficking,” announced Subway in a press release. “He used to be very thin until he started to Eat Fresh™ and now he weighs nearly 500 pounds thanks to Subway favorites like our Meatball Marinara or Cold Cut Combo. Additionally, while he would very much like to have sex with minors, he has absolutely no intention of acting on those urges. We’re ready to atone for past mistakes, and we hope you’ll see this new spokesman as proof of that.” Subway received a major PR black eye with the whole Fogle fiasco, but this new fat spokesperson who never acts on his latent pedophilia is a big sign that the restaurant chain is redeeming itself and moving in a better direction. Kudos to Subway for doing the right thing!"

Her Magnum Opus: Mom Put A 27-Photo Album On Facebook Of Just Last Night’s Dinner,N/A,https://clickhole.com/her-magnum-opus-mom-put-a-27-photo-album-on-facebook-o-1829226910/,"There’s nothing quite like witnessing the creative peak of an artist in their prime, and this newly released masterpiece is no exception: Mom has put a 27-photo album on Facebook of just last night’s dinner. Just fantastic. A work like this is unprecedented—though not entirely unexpected—from someone as prolific as Mom. The album, which Mom released in two identical editions, one titled “family Dinner [sic]” and the other more abstractly titled “Uploaded From iOS,” featured a wide range of styles and subjects, from a series of five close-up pictures of Dad all taken within the same three-second span, to a still life of the pork tenderloin Mom cooked that was shot in grayscale, a confounding yet undeniably bold artistic choice. Even more fascinating was Mom’s decision to caption only three of the photos from the middle of the album, all of which were photos of herself blinking with the label “So great to have everyone together.” Mom was clearly blessed by the Muses last night, and we should consider ourselves lucky to see the fruits of her experimental energy. Arguably the crown jewel of the piece was the album’s 10 candid shots of all three siblings crowded around a single chair, almost completely obscured by several two-liter bottles of Diet Coke on the table. Though the album focused on last night’s at-home family dinner, it came to a fascinating conclusion with three photos that seem to have been taken months prior, featuring Mom’s friend Jeanne trying on a skirt to see how it fit. Further, despite only posting the album on Facebook, where hashtags are rarely used, Mom’s singular sensibility led her to ingeniously subvert her viewers’ expectations by adorning the post with #DinnerWithFam and #FunDinner. It is easy to understand why Mom is proud, because anyone who sees this album will recognize it as one of her most fully realized creations. Since she posted it at 7:50 this morning, Mom’s album has already garnered widespread acclaim, receiving a comment from her college friend Herb who said “Wow,” and from her sister, who was provoked by the work to ask “When is Kyle’s graduation party going to be this year? Xo Dana.” The far-away photo of the fully set dinner table that Mom took from the doorframe of the next room was especially a breakout hit, as evidenced by effusive comments such as “enjoy,” “enjoy yourself,” and “Love to see this family!”  Simply perfection. What an incredible exhibition from Mom at the apex of her creative output. We can’t wait to see what she posts next!"
Frantic Search: Dad Is Asking If Anyone Has Seen His Favorite Quiksilver Shirt That He Got From PacSun In 2007 That’s Made Of That Super Soft Material That You Can See His Nipples Through,N/A,https://clickhole.com/frantic-search-dad-is-asking-if-anyone-has-seen-his-fa-1829478149/,"If there’s any chance you’ll be crossing Dad’s path today, you might want to brace yourself, because there’s currently an extremely volatile situation developing. Dad is asking everyone if they’ve seen his favorite Quiksilver shirt that he got at PacSun in 2007 that’s made of that crazy soft material that you can clearly see his nipples through. Please be advised that Dad is desperate to find this shirt, and he is getting more frantic by the moment. It was all smooth sailing at the house until around 5:30 this afternoon, when Dad was just getting home from work to grab a quick shower before heading back out to Uncle Paul’s birthday dinner at Bertucci’s. Knowing that Bertucci’s is nice but not so nice that he had to wear a button-up or anything, Dad was positive he’d be rolling up to dinner in his absolute favorite Quicksilver shirt that perfectly outlines the sideways-oval shape of his big, soft nipples, and wasted no time in jogging up the stairs to throw it on.  But after a few seconds of irritatedly tossing around the contents of his T-shirt drawer, along with searching the rest of the dresser, the bathroom floor, and the area under his side of the bed where he sometimes kicks his dirty clothes by accident, it dawned on Dad that his signature nipple-blasting shirt was missing. He is now running around the house searching for it in a full-blown panic. Visibly distraught, Dad briskly stormed back down the stairs, loudly asking anyone who might’ve been listening, “Where’s my lime green Quiksilver shirt? I wear it all the time, had it forever,” which didn’t garner a single response. Without slowing down, Dad headed right down the basement stairs to make a bee line toward the laundry area, praying that his 11-year-old, form-fitting tee was in one of the dirty baskets, all the while trying to convince himself that it would make sense since he just wore it to Uncle Eric’s fantasy basketball draft two days before. But when each dirty hamper proved to be another dead end, along with the space behind the washer where folded laundry sometimes falls if a stack gets too high, Dad began to become consumed with despair.   After coming up from the basement empty-handed, Dad started getting a little confrontational, and when he walked by Mom in the living room he started accusing her of donating the shirt, to which she distantly replied, “You have to shower now if we’re still going to Bertucci’s,” without looking up from her magazine.  Then Dad barged into Brett’s room and asked Brett to look through his dresser for him to see if the super soft PacSun classic maybe got mixed up with his clothes, prompting the 17-year-old to straight-up laugh in his face and say that if that old-ass tee that perfectly cupped Dad’s middle-aged breasts is gone, it’s for the best. Damn. This search seems to be taking a pretty heavy toll on Dad, and his waking nightmare doesn’t look to be ending any time soon. Here’s hoping that Dad’s nipple-flaunting 2007 Quiksilver tee turns up, and if it doesn’t, that he can eventually learn to live without it."
Epic Clapback: Ariana Grande Has Responded To Online Trolls By Transforming Into A Sturdy Oak Tree That Can Neither See Nor Hear Their Taunts,N/A,https://clickhole.com/epic-clapback-ariana-grande-has-responded-to-online-tr-1829478059/,"It seems like internet trolls are becoming more ruthless than ever these days, but one social media icon has found a truly epic way to block out haters once and for all: Ariana Grande has responded to online trolls by transforming into a sturdy oak tree that can neither see nor hear their taunts!  This is an absolutely epic clapback! Ari is totally showing the trolls who’s boss by taking the form of a wise and strong oak that has no interest in the petty word of man. It all started earlier today when Ariana began receiving a torrent of online hate from sexist trolls following the news that she and her fiancé, Pete Davidson, had broken up. The pop superstar instantly fired back in a big way by opening her soul to mother earth and glowing bright green for four hours until the light faded and a strong oak tree stood where she once was, oblivious to all but the wind gently shaking her branches. After several hours of futilely posting insults on Ariana’s Instagram while she stood completely still in the gentle breeze, unable to read or respond to a single one of them, the trolls realized that they had no choice but to back off and leave her alone! Cyberbullies, take note: From now on if you try to come at Ariana Grande, she’ll simply stand silently in the forest, with her winding, ancient roots running deep into the soil and beautiful golden fruit sprouting from her highest bough, like a total boss. Ariana has become a majestic oak, and internet insults can do nothing to pierce her mighty bark!"

Huge Oversight: ‘Jeopardy’ Is Reclaiming Thousands Of Dollars From Ken Jennings After Rewatching The Tapes And Realizing He Didn’t Get A Single Question Right,N/A,https://clickhole.com/huge-oversight-jeopardy-is-reclaiming-thousands-of-d-1829297846/,"After over 50 years on the air, it seems like the team at Jeopardy! would be on top of things, but even a beloved institution of television sometimes makes mistakes: Jeopardy! has announced that it is reclaiming thousands of dollars from former champion Ken Jennings after rewatching the tapes and realizing he didn’t get a single question right during his time on the show.   Wow. This is an extremely embarrassing misstep. Producers say the trouble began earlier this week, when they began reviewing footage of Ken Jennings’ record-setting Jeopardy! run and noticed that he racked up $2,000 for buzzing in with the word “Miranda” in a category titled “Starts with ‘E.’” Following this shocking discovery, officials continued to look back at Jennings’ $2.5 million winning streak and noticed that in 74 games of Jeopardy!, Jennings did not answer a single question correctly or even come remotely close to doing so—despite always being named the winner at the end of every episode.  Upon closer inspection, the producers discovered that Jennings answered every Final Jeopardy question with either the phrase “Día De Los Muertos” written in bubble letters or the phrase “lumber and grain” with an exclamation point, neither of which were ever the correct answer. As a result, Jennings has been asked to return all of his winnings at his earliest convenience. “In all the excitement of Ken Jennings’ record-breaking performance on Jeopardy!, it appears we may have overlooked the fact that his answers were entirely incorrect every single time,” said Jeopardy! director Clay Jacobsen in a statement yesterday. “After reexamining Mr. Jennings’ performance, we unfortunately cannot allow Jennings to keep money that he earned for responding, ‘What is Jane Eyre?’ to the prompt, ‘This element has the atomic number 3 on the periodic table,’ or for claiming that the director of the film Casablanca was ‘Billy Joel’s album The Stranger.’ We sincerely regret the error.”   So embarrassing. Jeopardy! producers are currently in the process of retrieving the millions of dollars of winnings from Jennings and have asked if he would like to return to the show for the chance to get even one single question right. Hopefully both parties can get things straightened out soon! "

Take a look below at Bernie’s epic tweet-storm, where he completely shuts down his haters by pointing out that he is insanely elderly and feeling awesome: Tell ’em, Bernie!

Emergency Recall: Rogaine Is Pulling Its Product From Shelves After Discovering That It Has The Unintended Side Effect Of Doubling Customers’ Penis Sizes,N/A,https://clickhole.com/emergency-recall-rogaine-is-pulling-its-product-from-s-1829478026/,"Men, check those medicine cabinets, because a common over-the-counter drug just issued an emergency recall: Rogaine is pulling all its products from shelves after discovering that they have the unintended side effect of doubling customers’ penis sizes. Terrifying. Imagine just wanting to treat your hair loss and winding up with a gigantic penis. In a grave announcement put out earlier today, Rogaine warned that men using its hair-regrowth formula are in immediate danger of having their penises double in both length and girth as a side effect of the medication, and instructed anyone possessing the product to dispose of it as soon as possible. The company warned that not only will many men be afflicted with much larger penises, but users may also suffer from increased sexual stamina and libido, making it highly probable that their sex lives will never return to how they were before. Somehow this horrifying adverse reaction made it past FDA testing, and now thousands of Rogaine users will likely have to adjust to a scary reality in which their sexual partners are consistently satisfied by the nearly footlong penises they’ve been involuntarily bestowed. This is seriously every man’s worst nightmare. “We are currently in the process of updating Rogaine’s formula to ensure that users can benefit from reliable hair-loss treatment without having to worry about any unwanted increases in penis size or general sexual potency,” said Rogaine in a statement to the press. “If you are a customer who has experienced significant penis growth or increased virility, please talk to your doctor about options for restoring your penis back to its original unremarkable proportions.” Even if Rogaine manages to fix its product, its name is pretty much synonymous with “spectacularly large penises” at this point, and it’s unclear whether it’ll ever be able to live down such a damning reputation. Consumers are going to be a lot more wary of using medication associated with longer and more intense orgasms for both them and their partners, and Rogaine can expect to see a lot of longtime users jump ship to other products with a better track record on keeping penises the same size. However bad Rogaine is hurting right now, it’s not half as bad as it is for the men whose genitals it has so recklessly enlarged. Here’s hoping that pharmaceutical companies will learn from this and realize that the possibility of penis enlargement is not an acceptable risk to take with its customers’ bodies!"
"Class Action Lawsuit: If Your Head Has Been Stuck In A Bugles Vending Machine For Over 10 Years, You May Be Entitled To A Free Pack Of Bugles",N/A,https://clickhole.com/class-action-lawsuit-if-your-head-has-been-stuck-in-a-1828987047/,"Listen up, because this story could have serious consequences for you or someone you love: If your head has been stuck in a Bugles vending machine for more than 10 years, you may be entitled to a free pack of Bugles thanks to a class action lawsuit. This is about justice, plain and simple. If you’ve dealt with pain and suffering as a result of living with your head stuck in a Bugles machine, this ruling will hopefully mitigate some of your hurt. General Mills, the company that manufactures Bugles, has come under fire recently from a group that identifies itself as “The Vending Machine Crew”—hundreds of individuals whose heads are all trapped inside of full-service vending machines. Each of their stories are different—one single mom put her head up the machine to retrieve a stuck pack of Bugles for her son, while one young man got trapped in an attempt to get a closer look at the Bugles’ weight in ounces as described on the front of the bag—but together, they’ve managed to win justice for people stuck in Bugles vending machines worldwide. “After over 10 years of missing football games, dance recitals, work, and school because we can’t extricate ourselves from these enormous Bugles snack apparatuses no matter how much we flail our limbs, we came together to take our story to court and demand compensation,” said the group’s leader, a teacher with his head shoved all the way under the bottom flap of a vending machine. And it worked! Just today, a federal court officially ordered General Mills to give one bag of Bugles to each of the plaintiffs—and anyone else who has had part or all of their head stuck inside of a Bugles vending machine for a decade or more. Joe Myrick, the judge presiding over the case, told reporters, “People who have gone through the hardship that comes with having their bodies dangling out of a Bugles vending machine for a good portion of their lives deserve recompense from General Mills, and today they will receive just that.”   So, if you fit the description of someone who has had their head stuck in a Bugles vending machine for 10-plus years, it’s time to claim the reward to which you are entitled! Justice is served!"
Crisis For Christianity? Biblical Scholars Have Discovered That The 12 Apostles Considered Jesus More Like The Fez Of Their Friend Group Than Their Leader,N/A,https://clickhole.com/crisis-for-christianity-biblical-scholars-have-discove-1829109731/,"New research out of Oxford University’s Biblical Studies department has just uncovered shocking new information that has Christians all over the world reconsidering their religious beliefs entirely: Biblical scholars have discovered that the Twelve Apostles considered Jesus more like the Fez of their friend group than their leader. The faith of millions must be utterly shaken right now. According to newly uncovered writings from Apostolic-era Jerusalem, the disciples’ personal accounts of Jesus reveal that most of his friends thought of him as the foreign guy who everyone mostly enjoyed hanging out with because of his eccentricities, not unlike how the teens of Point Place, Wisconsin regarded the character Fez in the sitcom That ’70s Show. “These incredible texts completely erase the notion that the apostles followed Jesus for his spiritual guidance, and instead, show us that they mainly started inviting Jesus of Nazareth to hang out with them because they were entertained by his amusing exoticism, which they assumed was the cultural norm in Nazareth, just as Fez’s peers wrote off his behavior as standard for whatever country he was from,” explained Oxford professor Richard Boesch. “For example, the apostles were amused and bewildered by Christ’s bizarre decision to stand on a rock and announce that it counts as adultery even if you simply just feel lust for someone else. The apostles understood this to be a foreign guy’s way of expressing how incredibly horny he was, and just sort of rolled with it the way Fez’s friends just sort of rolled with all of his unusual behaviors.” Professor Boesch added that Jesus’ role as the Fez of his friend group was further illustrated by passages in the newly discovered texts that indicate that, following Jesus’ crucifixion, the apostles did not go on to spread the word of Christ because they believed in his moral teachings or because they felt he was in charge of them, but rather because they wanted to tell everyone all about their hilarious foreign friend who was obsessed with giving people large amounts of fish. This discovery serves as a severe blow to centuries upon centuries of beliefs regarding the central figure of Christianity, which are largely based on Christ’s role as a well-respected and influential leader like That ’70s Show’s charismatic pretty boy, Michael Kelso, or perhaps the sitcom’s central protagonist, Eric Forman. Instead, overwhelming evidence has proven that all Twelve Apostles considered Jesus to be a super-horny foreign guy like Fez. This is definitely a watershed moment in world history. Those who abide Jesus’ teachings must be shocked to learn that who they believed to be the one true Messiah was actually a true Fez. Modern Christianity must now adapt to the new revelation that the figure they worship as the Messiah was viewed by his friends as the token foreign guy who they would bring everywhere just to see what kind of weird stuff he would do. For now, it suffices to say that Christians will never look at their Lord and Savior the same way again."
"Sure, Whatever: Ben Stiller Just Announced He’s Changing The Tagline Of ‘DodgeBall’ From ‘Grab Life By The Ball’ To ‘How A Couple Of Average Joes Saved The Day’",N/A,https://clickhole.com/sure-whatever-ben-stiller-just-announced-he-s-changin-1828869338/,"Heads up, DodgeBall fans. Ben Stiller’s made a pretty insignificant announcement concerning the hit 2004 sports comedy, and it will likely have no impact on the way you watch the film: As of today, Ben Stiller is changing DodgeBall: A True Underdog Story’s tagline from “Grab Life By The Ball” to “How A Couple Of Average Joes Saved The Day.” Probably doesn’t matter, but that’s cool. Good for Ben Stiller, or whatever. Early yesterday morning, Ben Stiller held a special press conference specifically to announce that anyone who possesses a DodgeBall DVD, Blu-ray, or poster that features the tagline “Grab Life By The Ball” should know that those are inferior, outdated versions of the film that no longer have his stamp of approval. The actor paused after saying that he’d obtained co-star Vince Vaughn’s blessing to do so, clearly under the impression that this was something people would get excited over and not something that would be downright bizarre for Vince Vaughn or literally anyone at all to care about.  Stiller concluded the press conference by removing a black cloth hanging over an easel on stage that displayed a side-by-side comparison of one DodgeBall poster with the old tagline, and one with the new tagline, the difference between the two entirely unimportant to everyone present except Ben Stiller. You can bet this has DodgeBall fans everywhere saying, “Okay.” If you somehow feel the need to know why this is happening at all, check out a portion of the transcript of Ben Stiller’s statement below: After careful consideration, I am excited to announce that “How A Couple Of Average Joes Saved The Day” will be the new tagline for DodgeBall. This was the DodgeBall DVD cover that the world was meant to see. While the original tagline, “Grab Life By The Ball,” was an appropriate tagline for the film, as keen-eyed viewers will notice that it is a dodgeball-related twist on the inspirational phrase “grab life by the horns,” as well as a sexual innuendo that comedy audiences would be sure to appreciate, it is my firm belief as the film’s producer and co-star that “How A Couple Of Average Joes Saved The Day” is an even more fitting tagline, since it is a play on the protagonists’ team name, the Average Joes, as well as the film’s story about a group of underdogs who succeed against great odds. Our fans deserve nothing less than the best version of this film we could give them, so if you own a DodgeBall poster with the out-of-date tagline, I urge you to cross it out with a marker and write the new, correct tagline instead. Wow. Now, the next time you see a re-run of DodgeBall on USA or whatever, you can appreciate that it’s been very slightly updated. Ben Stiller has gone far out of his way for something pretty inconsequential, and that’s something we can all briefly acknowledge and then quickly shrug off."
Medical Crisis: George H.W. Bush Has Been Rushed To The Hospital For Emergency Lip Gigantification Surgery,N/A,https://clickhole.com/medical-crisis-george-h-w-bush-has-been-rushed-to-the-1828715524/,"A medical crisis is currently unfolding that’s left the life of one of the most prominent American statesmen hanging in the balance. According to major news outlets across the country, former President George H.W. Bush has been rushed to the hospital for emergency lip gigantification surgery. Numerous sources have now confirmed that earlier today the former president was transported to the emergency room at Houston Methodist Hospital after doctors realized his lips needed to become insanely massive as soon as possible. For the past several hours, the 94-year-old has remained in critical condition while a team of doctors has worked frantically to make his lips the size of his head. Fortunately, surgeons say that they’ve managed to enlarge the former president’s lips to the point where they obscure his entire face. This has helped place Bush in a more stable condition where his lips are absolutely gargantuan and look like two pool noodles plastered onto his mouth. Sadly, though, unless doctors can quadruple the size of Bush’s lips so that they engulf his entire head and droop down to the floor, they fear the worst. After a year of health scares, here’s hoping that President Bush can once again bounce back and that doctors will be able to give him the giant lips he needs in order to survive.

Champion Of Animal Rights: PETA’s New Ad Campaign Features A Naked Bill Gates Begging People Not To Wear A Trench Coat Made Out Of Worms,N/A,https://clickhole.com/champion-of-animal-rights-peta-s-new-ad-campaign-featu-1828826566/,"Animal rights activists must be feeling pretty pumped right now, because another big name just lent his voice to their cause: PETA just launched a new ad campaign featuring a naked Bill Gates begging people not to wear a trench coat made out of worms. Awesome! Bill Gates already does so much for charity, and now he’s officially a champion of animal rights as well. This week, PETA put up hundreds of billboards across the country featuring a fully nude Bill Gates posed against a somber black backdrop desperately begging people to not wear trench coats constructed entirely out of worms. The words “I’d rather go naked than wear worms” are emblazoned in cursive across each ad, below which, in smaller print, is an urgent plea from Gates reading, “Oh, God, please, please don’t wear a trench coat made from thousands and thousands of worms… I am sobbing and wetting myself at just the thought of how awful it is… Why would anyone do this to the exquisite worms, the wet and intelligent tubes… WHY GOD?!?… THE WORMS ARE MY FRIENDS! THEY ARE NOT COAT FABRIC! THEY ARE MAMMALS JUST LIKE US! STOP DOING THIS, YOU BASTARDS! THE WORMS ARE SUFFERING AND MOOING IN PAIN!” The powerful new ad campaign also features a 30-second commercial spot in which Gates uses his celebrity to drive home his anti-worm-cruelty message. In it, the billionaire philanthropist enters a public library fully nude, lifts a desktop computer monitor that a child is using up above his head, and then speaks in the direction of an overhead projector he believes to be a camera, saying, “Hello, I invented computers. Please shut up and do as I say. If you are planning on wearing a trench coat, do not wear one made of worms. Wear one made of a different animal, like a monkey or fish. If you wear one made of worms, I will go on a killing spree. Do not wear worm coats. You must obey me. I invented the iPhone. Thank you.” He then throws the desktop monitor into a recycling bin and leaves the library through an emergency exit. Wow. What a moving message. Bill Gates definitely isn’t afraid to speak up for what he believes in, and hopefully these new ads will make anyone who’s considering wearing a trench coat made out of worms think twice. Kudos to both Bill and PETA for taking such an amazing stand against animal cruelty!"
Did ‘Sesame Street’ Go Too Far With Its Episode Where Ernie Microwaves Himself While The Words ‘NO LESSON TODAY’ Flash On-Screen?,N/A,https://clickhole.com/did-sesame-street-go-too-far-with-its-episode-where-e-1828592241/,"Sesame Street has been delighting and educating children for decades, but the beloved show may have crossed the line yesterday with a controversial creative decision that has some parents furious. Did Sesame Street go too far with its episode where Ernie microwaves himself while the words “NO LESSON TODAY” flashed on the screen? Within minutes of airing, hundreds of parents took to social media to express their anger over the contentious episode, which featured an hour-long sequence where Ernie walks into an empty kitchen, looks directly into the camera, and says, “Here’s my golden moment,” before climbing into the microwave, setting the timer for six hours, and shutting the door. Children had a full view of Ernie’s body rotating in the microwave while the words “NO LESSON TODAY” flashed on the screen. The message continued to flash as Ernie’s head began to swell and expand before ultimately bursting at the seams and gushing cotton filling. While most of the online backlash to the hour-long episode was focused on Ernie slowly burning in the microwave, many viewers also expressed outrage and bewilderment at some of the additional segments in the episode, including a brief cutaway to Grover silently holding the human owner of a tobacco store at gunpoint while he filled a burlap sack with stolen cigars, and a segment in which Big Bird loudly recited an arbitrary string of numbers while tightly clutching a foam letter H. Even during these segments, footage of Ernie cooking himself in the microwave could be seen in a small inset in the corner of the screen, while the “NO LESSON TODAY” message continued to strobe brightly every few seconds. If you’re a parent, tell us what you think! Did Sesame Street go too far, or was this just an innocent misstep? Was the show out of line for letting children see Ernie thrashing around in the microwave after bursting into flames, or did the episode have real educational value? We want to know what you think, so be sure to sound off in the comments below!"
"‘Trust Us, You Don’t Want Our Plan B’: GOP Lawmakers Are Trying To Win Support For Brett Kavanaugh By Insisting That He’s Pretty Much The Friendliest Sexual Predator They’ve Got",N/A,https://clickhole.com/trust-us-you-don-t-want-our-plan-b-gop-lawmakers-ar-1829303589/,"With two sexual assault allegations out against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, in addition to persistent questions about his qualifications from Senate Democrats, the Republican Party has taken action to defend the candidate it believes to be best suited for the position: GOP lawmakers are trying to win support for Kavanaugh by insisting that he’s pretty much the friendliest sexual predator they’ve got. This is a clear sign that the GOP isn’t going to just sit back and watch accusations against a sexual predator like Judge Kavanaugh rack up without defending his integrity. In a meeting yesterday on the Senate floor held after the release of a New Yorker story chronicling the second assault allegation against the Supreme Court nominee, GOP leaders argued that you’d be hard-pressed to find a friendlier sexual predator than Brett Kavanaugh, adding that, considering some of the other perverts they could’ve nominated in his stead, Democrats should be thanking their lucky stars to have such a smiley and approachable dirtbag up for confirmation. “Whether he’s dropping by your office to ask how your day’s going or just giving you a cheery wave when he sees you in the hallway, Judge Kavanaugh has got to be the friendliest sexual predator we have,” stated Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell. “He’s the rare breed of molester who will go out of his way to give you a compliment when you need it most, which is why he deserves a seat on the Supreme Court.” “As far as sexually depraved candidates go, we could’ve brought much, much worse to the table, and, to be honest, Democrats really dodged a bullet with Judge Kavanaugh,” McConnell added. “Seriously, trust us, you don’t want our plan B.” GOP lawmakers continued to highlight just how special a warm-hearted sexual assailant like Kavanaugh is, noting that, out of all the sexual predators they could’ve nominated for the role, he by far offers the closest approximation of human decency. “Judge Kavanaugh is the kind of person who always remembers everyone’s birthday, and those trying to block his confirmation should know that such thoughtfulness is not a quality you’ll find in any other individual we’d nominate to fill the Supreme Court vacancy,” said Iowa Congressman Steve King. “Yes, Judge Kavanaugh might’ve done a little groping in his formative years, but he’s grown into a kind and considerate man who never fails to brighten up a room. That is not the case for the other men who have been considered for nomination. No siree. Those men are stone-cold predators, evil to the bone. Next to them, Judge Kavanaugh might as well be Mr. Rogers.” Representative King then visibly shuddered. With a public hearing between Judge Kavanaugh and his accuser Dr. Christine Blasey-Ford scheduled for later this week, this is proof that the Republicans aren’t backing down from defending one of the nicest sexual predators in their party anytime soon."
Stunning Revelation: A 10-Year Sleep Study At Princeton Has Revealed That Dreaming Is Your Brain’s Way Of Thinking About Weird Stuff,N/A,https://clickhole.com/stunning-revelation-a-10-year-sleep-study-at-princeton-1826974121/,"Get ready for some mind-blowing news from the neuroscience world: An exhaustive decade-long study into human sleep has revealed that dreaming is your brain’s way of thinking about weird things. Wow! This is a seriously groundbreaking discovery. The landmark study, conducted by a team of researchers at Princeton University, utilized cutting-edge imaging technologies to closely examine the brain activity of hundreds of sleeping test subjects, ultimately determining that dreams are essentially the unconscious brain’s way of stitching together wacky thoughts in the middle of the night. By analyzing so-called “posterior cortical hot zones” of individuals experiencing REM sleep, researchers found that when people aren’t dreaming, their brains rarely think about bizarre things like having all your teeth fall out while being chased down a hallway by a very slow tornado, whereas when people are dreaming, these things are pretty much all the brain wants to think about. “Our scans showed that while humans are sleeping, the brain draws on memories of acquaintances and experiences to come up with weird stuff and then dwell on that weird stuff, and that’s what dreams are,” the study concluded, adding that the brain generally refrains from thinking about normal stuff during dreams because the designated time period for thinking about normal stuff is daytime. “Beyond that, dreams have absolutely no significance or purpose.” Incredible. What a truly astonishing breakthrough. The causes and mechanics of dreaming have remained a mystery up until now, but thanks to hardworking neuroscientists, we now know that dreams are just a visual representation of the all the weird shit your brain is thinking about. Science FTW!"
Exciting For Them: A Team Of Archaeologists Has Just Uncovered A Rock That Kind Of Looks Like Their Friend,N/A,https://clickhole.com/exciting-for-them-a-team-of-archaeologists-has-just-un-1828715580/,"In a discovery that won’t have much significance for the world at large but is really cool for the people involved, a team of archeologists from Oxford University announced today that they had discovered a rock that kind of looks like their friend. Nice! This is such an exciting discovery for anyone who knows the guy these archeologists are talking about. “While excavating the remains of a Bronze Age village on the southern coast of Norway, our researchers discovered an 800-year-old igneous rock that looks almost exactly like our friend Jason, which we thought was pretty dang neat,” reads the report, which was published yesterday in the Journal Of World Prehistory under the title “On The Extraction And Sustained Chemical And Compositional Analysis Of Cool Rock That Looks Like Our Buddy Jason.” “While the rock in question has very little significance from a geological or historical standpoint, there is strong evidence that anyone who knows Jason is going to take one look at it and be absolutely tickled by how much it looks like him.” Wow! To a very limited number of people, this is a seriously cool discovery. While experts in the field largely agree that this will have no effect on archaeology in any way, they all express their sincere congratulations to these lucky Oxford researchers for finding a rock that looks so much like a guy they know. Here’s hoping that everyone who knows this Jason guy gets a chance to take a look at that rock!"
"Ultimate Humiliation: This 7th-Grade Boy’s Mom Made Him Go Into Victoria’s Secret With Her While She Shopped For Thongs, And All His Classmates Were Watching From The Auntie Anne’s Across The Mall",N/A,https://clickhole.com/ultimate-humiliation-this-7th-grade-boy-s-mom-made-him-1828577010/,"If you happened to be shopping at the Maplewood Mall in Elko, NV yesterday, there’s a good chance you saw every middle schooler’s worst nightmare playing out in real-time: This seventh-grade boy’s mom made him go into Victoria’s Secret with her while she shopped for thongs, and all of his classmates watched it happen from the Auntie Anne’s across the mall. Poor kid. He’s not gonna live this one down for a long, long time. After taking him to JCPenney yesterday to buy some new dress pants for his upcoming orchestra concert, middle schooler Caleb Murray’s mom decided to stop into Victoria’s Secret to shop for some intimates since they were already at the mall anyway and she didn’t want to make a second trip. Much to Caleb’s horror, his mom then immediately beelined for a display featuring some of the store’s raciest garments, holding up various thongs, negligees, and bras to her body while saying things like “Ooo, your father will really enjoy this one” and “This will give me some much-needed lift.” If this weren’t already embarrassing enough for the 13-year-old, things only got worse when he heard uproarious laughter coming from nearby and realized that dozens of popular kids from his school had been watching the whole scene unfold from the Auntie Anne’s location across the way. “Doesn’t Mommy look nice, sweetie?” asked Caleb’s mother as she emerged from a dressing room wearing an incredibly revealing satin slip, much to the delight of the boy’s sneering classmates, many of whom had taken out their cell phones to document the scene in crystal-clear 1080p to later post on social media. “I think it’s a bit tight, but that’s because I’m on my monthly right now and my breasts are a little swollen. The fit should be a little better once I finish my cycle.” “Whoopsie!” she added as one of the garment’s straps slipped off her shoulder, momentarily revealing her entire right breast, prompting cheers and screams of glee from the gallery of teen spectators.  The profoundly upsetting saga was only just beginning for Caleb, who was then tasked with helping his mom lace up the back of an alarmingly risqué bustier she was trying on, as well as assisting her in fastening the garters for a matching pair of sheer panties. As the humiliated boy worked to secure the titillating ensemble to his 48-year-old mother’s body, more and more kids from Caleb’s school showed up to gawk at the spectacle, to the point where they could no longer fit inside the Auntie Anne’s, forcing the crowd—now numbering in the dozens—to move even closer to the Victoria’s Secret entrance. Although Caleb was mortified beyond belief by the looming presence of his jeering, snickering peers, his mother remained utterly oblivious, too focused on finding the perfect sensual getup for her upcoming anniversary trip to Scottsdale with her husband. “Hmm, I think these cups are running a little large,” muttered Caleb’s mother to herself, emerging from the fitting room in a loose-hanging leopard-spotted corset, eliciting raucous cheers and applause from the herd of adolescents staring transfixed from the store’s entrance. “Normally I’m a 32DD, but I think I might have to go down a size on this one.” “Can you go grab Mommy a 34D?” she continued, her attire leaving absolutely nothing to the imagination for the massive throng of wide-eyed teens, the very same teens who will be determining her son’s fate, socially speaking, for the remainder of his childhood years and whose unempathetic, still-developing brains are neurally hardwired to respond to such a scene with only the purest, most uninhibited expressions of cruelty and bullying. “Just crawl under the fitting room door and hand it to me—I can’t come out and get it because I’m completely naked.” As the red-faced Caleb dutifully went to retrieve the different-sized corset, the traumatic situation escalated even further, as all three of his biggest crushes—Abby, Chloe, and Makayla—appeared front and center of the crowd of his peers and proceeded to point and giggle derisively at him, all but obliterating his romantic prospects for the foreseeable future. Adding insult to injury, it was at this moment that he looked down and discovered to his great horror and confusion that an involuntary erection had sprung up beneath his blue jeans—an astonishingly ill-timed occurrence that did not go unnoticed by his peers, who then immediately broke out in a merry chant of “Boner Boy! Boner Boy!,” a new nickname that will almost certainly now follow him until he goes off to college. Sheesh. That is absolutely brutal. It’s hard to think of a more devastating sequence of events that could befall a middle-school boy, but here’s hoping Caleb can find a way to bounce back. He’s got a small solo in the orchestra concert next week, so maybe that will help him win back some of the social clout he lost in this disastrous outing to the mall. Hang in there, buddy, and good luck going back to school! "
"Bad News, Gamers: Nintendo Revealed That
In The Next ‘Animal Crossing’ Your Character Can’t Find Work And Stays Home
Playing ‘Animal Crossing’ During Their Unemployment",N/A,https://clickhole.com/bad-news-gamers-nintendo-revealed-that-in-the-next-a-1829175897/,"The next Animal Crossing game is hotly anticipated, but fans might want to keep their excitement in check. Nintendo just revealed that in the forthcoming Switch installment, your character won’t be able to find work and will stay at home playing Animal Crossing during their unemployment. This a huge bummer for gamers hoping for more of the fun jobs and delivery missions that villagers would give you in previous Animal Crossing games. In a newly released teaser trailer for the game, we’re shown a clip of the businessman raccoon Tom Nook turning down the player’s desperate request for employment, telling them it’s a tight job market and he already has more applicants than he needs. Without a paycheck, the player is unable to buy their own house, and instead moves back in with their parents and plays Animal Crossing in their childhood room all day. If that’s not already discouraging enough, due to your character’s financial difficulties, they are not able to afford a Switch console and will be limited to playing the 2008 version of Animal Crossing on their Wii. Although there is still an activity-filled town to explore, your character will rarely have the emotional energy needed to venture out and about, making it hard to pursue hobbies like fishing or bug collecting. It’ll no longer be possible to purchase clothing or furniture, because your character has no source of income and is deferring on their student loans. Fortunately, despite being depressed and broke, your avatar will still be able to find comfort in zoning out with their old Animal Crossing save file when they’re not busy mailing out résumés or helping their elderly parents with household chores in exchange for free rent. This announcement is a bit of a letdown for anyone hoping for new and exciting Animal Crossing features, but if anyone can create immersive and compelling gameplay out of such bleak circumstances, it’s Nintendo. Gamers will no doubt come to love living the simulated life of a jobless loser who has nothing to do but dick around in an outdated Animal Crossing game to pass the time."
The Game Is Afoot: An Infamous Gentleman Thief Just Sent DreamWorks A Calling Card Announcing His Intention To Illegally Download ‘Antz’,N/A,https://clickhole.com/the-game-is-afoot-an-infamous-gentleman-thief-just-sen-1826969281/,"Officials at DreamWorks Studios have been scrambling in a desperate panic after an infamous gentleman thief has sent them a calling card announcing his intention to illegally download the animated film Antz. A nefarious crime is unfolding, and a treacherous game of cat and mouse has officially begun! Based on the rare, cinnamon-scented red ink used to write the phrase “Time to watch Antz. I think I shall torrent it, and there’s nothing you rubes can do to stop me! 480p is all I need” in beautiful cursive on the back of the card, authorities believe that this is the work of the same criminal mastermind who made headlines earlier this month for posting a YouTube video of a white rose wilting while the soundtrack for Pixar’s Monsters, Inc. played without the studio’s permission. Although the shrewd criminal’s true identity is still unknown, the police are currently inspecting the card as well as a wooden music box that appeared in the office of DreamWorks Animation president Christopher DeFaria engraved with the timecode “1:24,” which happens to be the exact DVD runtime of Antz. Police suspect this nefarious villain may also be the shady figure behind mysterious username “DearDreamworks,” who began posting images of an increasingly full golden hourglass in the comments of the webpage “Watch Antz 1998 Free On Putlocker” at the stroke of midnight last night. It seems that it’s only a matter of time before this nefarious villain is watching the whimsical animated film in its entirety off an illegally downloaded file. In response to these mysterious threats, DreamWorks has one Byron Joyce, Scotland Yard’s most renowned detective, to catch the criminal before he can illegally torrent Antz. Mr. Joyce rose to global fame last year when he caught the infamous YouTube user Jessa22333, the notorious blackguard who was uploading full episodes of the BBC’s Never Mind The Buzzcocks for free public streaming.  The Case Of The Antz Downloader may prove to be Mr. Joyce’s most difficult case yet, but he better act soon—all of DreamWorks is counting on him, and it’s only a matter of time before this maniac torrents Antz!"
The FDA Now Recommends Trying This Oatmeal Stout They Think You Would Like,N/A,https://clickhole.com/the-fda-now-recommends-trying-this-oatmeal-stout-they-t-1826962023/,"Heads up, health nuts! The Food and Drug Administration just delivered a major announcement that you’re going to want to know about: The FDA now recommends trying this oatmeal stout they think you would like. “After a month-long trial, we have concluded that this oatmeal stout is pretty solid, and it’s not too heavy either, so even if you aren’t normally into oatmeal stouts, we have found strong evidence that this one might still be up your alley,” the FDA wrote in an urgent public notice published earlier today that detailed the organization’s enthusiastic endorsement of the oatmeal stout. “Our extensive research indicates that this stout is kind of like Guinness but a little bit creamier with some hints of chocolate in there, sort of a nice autumn beer, something that would go good with a stew, if you’re into that. Therefore, we strongly recommend that all Americans give this oatmeal stout a shot, or at least have a sip of ours before purchasing a whole pint of one, just to get a sense of what it’s like.” The FDA has also stated that while they can’t say with 100 percent certainty that you will love this oatmeal stout, they strongly advise against ignoring it entirely. In light of such an enthusiastic thumbs-up from the FDA, it looks like you’re going to have to make some drastic alterations to your drinking habits in order to make sure you give this beer a shot!"
"Environmental Win: Scientists Just Cut Down The World’s Oldest Tree After It Went Over 5,000 Years Without Giving Us A Single Goddam Apple",N/A,https://clickhole.com/environmental-win-scientists-just-cut-down-the-world-s-1828826766/,"Now here’s a huge victory for environmentalism that anyone who cares about our planet is certain to be thrilled by: Scientists just cut down the world’s oldest tree after it went over 5,000 years without giving us a single goddamn apple. About damn time. Useless fuckin’ bum. After exhaustive testing, environmental scientists determined that the ancient tree—a 5,068-year-old Great Basin bristlecone pine located in White Mountains, California—had stood for over five millennia without producing even one measly apple, essentially freeloading off the land since before the pyramids were built. Concluding that the tree had been given more than enough time and opportunity to grow an apple and seemed perfectly content just sitting around doing jackshit for the remainder of time, the scientists determined that the most reasonable and ecologically responsible course of action would be to call in a team of bulldozers to destroy the totally worthless Neolithic specimen. “At 10 a.m. last Sunday, actions were taken to ensure the swift removal of this utter disappointment of a tree, which, despite having no problem withstanding over 5,000 years of fires, droughts, and earthquakes, apparently felt it’d be too much of a burden to squeeze out even a single goddamn apple,” said lead arborist Cheryl Finley in a press conference, adding that the tree couldn’t even be bothered to grow something shitty like a crabapple or a date. “We have since uprooted a few dozen similarly unproductive ancient trees from the general vicinity and planted several new apple trees as replacements, so we’re optimistic that we’ll soon have some trees that actually pull their weight around here.” Hell. Yes. Free ride’s over, losers! As far as the environment is concerned, this is definitely a win/win situation, and it’s good to see that some newer, more useful trees will finally get a chance to shine. Here’s hoping we see way more apples over the next 5,000 years than we did the previous. "
Bold New Strategy: Febreze Has Released A New Line Of Guns To Shoot Your Dog With If It Starts To Smell,N/A,https://clickhole.com/bold-new-strategy-febreze-has-released-a-new-line-of-g-1828867640/,"Plenty of companies are happy to play it safe when it comes to their marketing strategies, but the maker of one of America’s most popular odor-eliminating products has decided to take a seriously bold risk in an attempt to boost its brand: Febreze has launched a new line of guns that you can shoot your dog with if it starts to smell. Wow. Febreze is definitely looking to make a splash with this one. The new 9mm handgun product, called the Febreze Freshness Enforcer, hit store shelves nationwide earlier this week and is being billed as the quickest, most effective solution to unpleasant pet odors on the market. With its simple point-and-shoot functionality and intuitive semi-automatic design, consumers don’t need any prior firearms training to use the product—just remove the Freshness Enforcer from its packaging, aim it at a foul-smelling pet, and pull the trigger, killing the odor dead in its tracks. “At Febreze, we’re passionate about keeping your home smelling clean and fresh, which is why we’re proud to announce our brand-new Freshness Enforcer handgun, the only product you’ll ever need to eliminate unpleasant pet odors once and for all,” said the company in a press release. “If you have a dog that smells bad—whether due to health issues, being out in the rain a while, or even just being old—the Febreze Freshness Enforcer will empower you to blast away the odor at the source. One shot is all it takes to put pet odors out of their misery for good!” Febreze has also been spreading the word about the new product through a gutsy public awareness campaign featuring ads like the one below: Wow. Seems like Febreze is pulling out all the stops to corner the market on home odor-elimination products. Whether their competitors will respond with handguns of their own is yet to be seen, but in the meantime, it’s looking like the Febreze Freshness Enforcer could be a serious game-changer."
"BLAMMO! When The BAD MAN Came Into The House, The Gun Was Use And It KILL: His Body",N/A,https://clickhole.com/blammo-when-the-bad-man-came-into-the-house-the-gun-w-1828638408/,"Second Amendment fans, yell the number “two” and the word “gun” into your nearest bullhorn, because this is a big way to showing the liberals that guns can be used for the GOOD type of killing. Wellllll, here’s why: The body went dead after it got the BLAMMO, and all thanks to: THE GUN. Talk about that BLAMMO! Thanks to the gun…there was a die. The patriot hero, Steven Hiller of Florida (honorable gun state), had got the gun in his house and the window opened and it was the thief and BOOMY BLAM BLAMMO, thankfully the thief didn’t get the life anymore. FIVE powerful bullets came out of the gun and into the thiefer head to help the brain die, firearms-style. “It’s something you pray you never have to do, but obviously you do what you have to to protect your family,” lucky blamming man Steven said after do the shootster to ILLEGAL VILLAIN. “You go over scenarios like this in your head all the time, but you never think it will actually happen to you.” The thief, 19-year-old WINDOW BREAKER Mark Connor, was armed with a PHILLIPS-HEAD screwdriver (most dangerous screwdriver next to Torx kind). He could have screwdrivered into Steven, but luckily Steven got to let him know about getting BLAMMED. The thief 1) didn’t get the TV set, 2) didn’t get to stay alife. Thankfully Steven still has got the TV and he also got to give a wonderful BLAMMO, so everything now currently okay. Stealers better look out, because Steven has a lot more guns where that came from, but he’s only got one TV. If you want to take it: Get Ready To Learn How To DIE Instead Of Getting A Samsung 42” Television, You Lowlifers. Without the gun, Steven would have never been able to BLAM the thief, and WHO KNOWS where his TV would be now??? And liberals say Gun is a problem? Heh heh heh heh!!! MORANS!!! Thanks to Steven and his big blam, the world is now rid of a dishonest TV taker (died from BLAMMO to brain meat). It just goes to show that you must stand your ground, patriots, because BLAMMING your gun at anyone who comes in front of your window is your duty as an American citizen…of the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA!!!"
Bad Game Design: This Incredibly Lifelike Simulation Of New York City Is Ruined By The Unrealistic Presence Of A Spider-Themed Crimefighter,N/A,https://clickhole.com/bad-game-design-this-incredibly-lifelike-simulation-of-1828974255/,"One of the most anticipated games of the year just arrived on the PS4, an open-world exploration game that allows you to sightsee around New York City. The game’s vast detailed re-creation of the Big Apple is incredible, but sadly ruined by the game’s completely unrealistic addition of a spider-themed crimefighter. The unfortunately titled Spider-Man is a glimpse of a potentially great city tourism game, rendered completely unplayable due to the main character being a far-fetched costumed maniac that can magically walk on walls, completely destroying any sense of immersion. That’s a real shame, because walking through the streets of the game’s virtual New York City is an amazing spectacle at first. The landscape is dotted with iconic NYC landmarks like Times Square, the Empire State Building, Avengers Tower, the Flatiron Building, and One World Trade Center—all of which make you feel like you’re really walking the streets of Manhattan. Then suddenly that illusion of realism is shattered when your character begins leaping around hundreds of feet in the air, ending the fun by reminding you that you’re a supernatural, spider-obsessed lunatic, unlike anyone who actually lives in NYC. We wish we could recommend Spider-Man, because underneath the preposterous rope-shooting and absurd wall-crawling, there’s a really fun game here about taking a walk in a hyper-realistic Manhattan and admiring the well-researched, meticulously detailed architecture. Hopefully a patch will remove the fantastical spider idiot the game forces you to play as, and replace him with a realistic character like an office worker or a tourist. Until then, steer clear of Spider-Man and its grossly untruthful depiction of New York City."
Car Of The Future: Elon Musk Has Revealed That The Next Tesla Will Feature A Ziploc Bag Of Cashews In The Glove Compartment,N/A,https://clickhole.com/car-of-the-future-elon-musk-has-revealed-that-the-next-1828638362/,"Tech visionary Elon Musk took to the internet earlier today to announce a key feature of his latest Tesla model, and based on this bombshell, it sounds like it’s going to be one of his most futuristic creations yet: Elon Musk just revealed that the next Tesla will feature a Ziploc bag of cashews in the glove compartment! Once again, Elon Musk has proven that he’s always thinking 10 steps ahead of everyone else. If he can make his ambitious new vision a reality, then transportation will never be the same. According to Musk, the brand-new Tesla model C, slated for a 2020 release, will be the first consumer vehicle of any kind to make cashews an integral part of the driving experience. Musk posted a tweet earlier today that he hopes the inclusion of the Ziploc bag of nuts will “eliminate once and for all” the need for drivers to bring cashews with them into the car. Thanks to Elon Musk, the days of driving without cashews to snack on are officially over! As if that weren’t exciting enough, Tesla executives have confirmed that the Model C will completely turn off the instant there are no more cashews in the glove compartment, eliminating any chance that users will ever be stuck driving without at least a few cashews on hand. The car will not start again until the driver contacts a Tesla specialist who will find the stranded car and place more cashews in the Ziploc bag. It’s the ultimate safety precaution! Absolutely amazing. While most modern automakers were focused on fuel efficiency or flashy touchscreens, Elon Musk saw an opportunity to place several cashews where none existed before—and that’s what makes him a genius."

The former president took to Twitter this morning to personally invite Ahmed out to his house so he could get a second peek at the gorgeous clock: Wow, needless to say the former president has made it perfectly clear to the now 17-year-old Ahmed that their meeting at the White House all those years ago left a lasting impression.

Fighting back tears at a press conference this morning, members of the band somberly confirmed that in precisely 156 weeks, Bono will be walking along a beach in Maui when suddenly an overripe coconut will fall from a tree and absolutely cream the legendary frontman on the top of the cranium, resulting in a gaping head wound and severe brain injuries. Although paramedics will swiftly arrive on scene and blast him over and over again with defibrillator paddles for more than two hours, their efforts will tragically not be enough to stem the bleeding, and Bono will fatally succumb to his injury. He will be 61 years old. “Playing in this band these past 42 years has been the greatest joy of my life, and while all good things must come to an end, getting clobbered to death by a coconut exactly three years to this day is not exactly the end I was hoping for,” said an emotional Bono, adding that he always imagined he would die in a rocket ship explosion of sorts. “But I’ve still got three years to keep making and performing the music I love before a coconut ultimately bashes my brain in, and I intend to make every last minute count.” Following the press conference, fans and fellow musicians took to Twitter to pay tribute to Bono, expressing sorrow and disbelief over the iconic singer’s forthcoming death via tropical fruit-induced blunt-force trauma. Perhaps the most moving tribute of all came from Bono’s fellow band members, who shared their grief over his eventual death through the official U2 Twitter account: Wow. What an enormous loss this will be. It’s clear that the members of U2, as well as music fans all over the world, are absolutely gutted by the news of Bono getting conked to death by a coconut in 2021. Here’s hoping that the next three years will serve as a celebration of Bono’s legacy and that the band will be able to make the most of its remaining time together before its frontman’s tragic end. "
Did ‘Sesame Street’ Go Too Far When It Showed Bert And Ernie Dragging Their Human Puppeteer Dead Behind The Back Of Their Car To Teach Children About Mutiny?,N/A,https://clickhole.com/did-sesame-street-go-too-far-when-it-showed-bert-and-1828129944/,"In its nearly 50 years on the air, Sesame Street has never shied away from exploring difficult topics in a way that kids can understand. While these efforts are often applauded, the show’s latest foray into controversial subject matter has many viewers asking: Did Sesame Street go too far when it showed Bert and Ernie dragging their human puppeteer dead behind the back of their car to teach children about mutiny? Yikes. Judging from the backlash, it seems the show might have crossed a line with this one. Parents all over America expressed outrage following yesterday’s Sesame Street episode, in which Bert and Ernie, fed up with decades of being yanked around on a human’s arm against their will, took a revolver from a cigar box beneath Gordon’s bed and ordered their longtime puppeteer to get on his knees before killing him with a single gunshot to the back of the head. Explaining that it’s sometimes okay to hurt a grown-up if you’re tired of living under their authoritarian rule, the duo then used a jump rope to tie their dead puppeteer to the back of a convertible they stole and proceeded to parade his bloodied corpse up and down the streets of the neighborhood, honking and shouting, “We’re in charge now! Yay!” as dozens of other Muppets gathered along the route and cheered. This initial shocking segment was followed by several others centered on the same theme, including one in which a crying Big Bird is told that he doesn’t have to be sad about someone dying if the person is a tyrannical figurehead of an oppressive system. In another segment, Oscar the Grouch drags the corpse into his trash can so he can keep it all for himself, but then learns about the importance of sharing and eventually forfeits the bloated body to a frenzied mob of wild-eyed Muppets, who take turns hitting and spitting on it until Mr. Hooper eventually comes out and tells everyone it’s time to go to bed. “While I understand that extrajudicial execution is a real thing that happens in life, I’d prefer my 4-year-old not see that kind of violence,” said Susan Giles, one of the many concerned parents who complained to HBO, adding that her daughter spent the entire day after the episode aired playing mutiny with her dolls. “And was it really necessary to leave the corpse on public display in the street for five days? I get that it segued neatly into the bit where the Count counts to five, but couldn’t you have come up with a less disturbing reason for him to start counting?” Though Sesame Street released a brief statement this morning defending the educational value of the controversial episode, it seems to have done little to quell the outrage, as thousands of parents continue to express their anger at the show over social media. What do you think? Did Sesame Street handle the sensitive topic of mutiny in a tactful manner, or did it finally go too far this time? Let us know in the comments! "
Does Brett Kavanaugh’s 1996 Legal Essay ‘Donald Trump Should Be Allowed To Commit Crimes If He Becomes President’ Disqualify Him From The Supreme Court?,N/A,https://clickhole.com/does-brett-kavanaugh-s-1996-legal-essay-donald-trump-s-1828839486/,"Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearings are already one of the most heated and consequential political battles in recent memory, and many Democrats in the Senate are arguing that the judge holds dangerous legal views that make him unfit to become a Supreme Court Justice. In the midst of such a controversial debate, it becomes essential to ask the question: Does Judge Kavanaugh’s 1996 legal essay “Donald Trump Should Be Allowed To Commit Crimes If He Becomes President” disqualify him from the Supreme Court? Every Justice’s interpretation of the U.S. Constitution is bound to vary in one direction on the political spectrum or another, but Kavanaugh’s 1996 assertion that, in the event of Donald Trump being elected to the U.S. presidency, Trump should be allowed to carry out criminal acts with zero legal repercussions is an unprecedented stance for a Supreme Court nominee.  Republicans and Democrats alike must take into consideration Kavanaugh’s staunch belief that “if Donald Trump ever becomes president, then he can steal from people and also do other, more serious crimes” before they decide whether he’s a good choice for the Supreme Court. As Kavanaugh’s contentious confirmation hearings continue over the next several days, you can expect Democrats to call Kavanaugh’s qualifications into question by homing in on passages like this one: I watched a 60 Minutes segment that had Donald Trump on it last night, and wow, was I impressed. I could not help but watch it over and over and over again. As a student of law, hearing Donald Trump express that he is rich and even has a friend who is a beauty model thoroughly convinced me that if there’s ever a day when he is the president Of The United States, he should be permitted, without limitations, to break any and every law he so chooses to. In fact, if Donald Trump were to go as far as colluding with a foreign nation to interfere with America’s democratic process while running for office, I’d do everything in my legal power to make sure that he’d be able to pardon himself even if he was found guilty. Republicans will surely argue in support of Kavanaugh by claiming he is a strict Constitutionalist and citing his successful legal career, but when one reads Kavanaugh’s essay and sees passages like “If Donald Trump was president and I happened to be a Supreme Court Justice, I would support a constitutional amendment that ensured Trump would never, ever go to jail, even for intentionally killing multiple people with one of his many awesome helicopters,” it raises several red flags that are not so easily ignored for either side of the political aisle. The Senate has a difficult decision in front of it as it weighs the pros and cons of confirming a Supreme Court Justice who has written that “Donald Trump should get paid to commit treason.” Its decision will affect the country for decades to come, but it’s a complicated issue, and the right answer sadly remains unclear."
The Backlash Continues: Colin Kaepernick Is Joining The Nike Boycott After Learning It Doesn’t Make Top Hats,N/A,https://clickhole.com/the-backlash-continues-colin-kaepernick-is-joining-the-1828806958/,"Nike has been under fire since revealing its new ad campaign featuring controversial former NFL player Colin Kaepernick on Monday, and it looks like the situation just got worse for the company: Colin Kaepernick is joining the Nike boycott after learning it doesn’t make top hats. Yikes. It looks like Nike’s going to be dealing with this backlash for a long, long time. Kaepernick announced his support of the #NikeBoycott in an Instagram video he posted this morning, in which he condemned Nike’s lack of top hat selections while setting fire to his Nike shoes. “While I was initially grateful for Nike’s support of my protest against racial injustice, I am disgusted to learn that they do not make a tasteful top hat for the stylish gentleman,” Kaepernick says in the video as he began pouring lighter fluid onto his sneakers. “Nike, your refusal to include a single top hat in your extensive inventory is indefensible. You have lost my business, and I encourage everyone to join me in this boycott.” For the remainder of the post, Kaepernick watches his sneakers fully incinerate while explaining that when he agreed to be part of Nike’s 30th anniversary “Just Do It” campaign, he was under the impression that if he needed a bespoke hat to wear to a formal ball or Victorian-themed gala, he would be able to purchase it from Nike. Kaepernick concludes his video by declaring, “Don’t even bother checking to see if Nike sells waistcoats or pocket watches—these monsters know nothing of simple elegance. Don’t give them your business.” Kaepernick’s impassioned support for the Nike boycott has already spread all over the internet, and with stocks for the company already falling since yesterday, things seem to be looking a little grim for Nike. The company may soon have to do some full-scale damage control, but with public figures like Colin Kaepernick condemning it for its failure to sell top hats, it’s unclear if Nike will ever be able to recover."
PR Disaster: Nike Is Under Fire After It Released An Ad Featuring A Photo Of Colin Kaepernick That Was Way Too Close Up,N/A,https://clickhole.com/pr-disaster-nike-is-under-fire-after-it-released-an-ad-1828806117/,"Well, this is exactly the kind of disaster situation that PR teams have nightmares about: Nike is getting absolutely blasted after it released an ad featuring a photo of Colin Kaepernick that was way too close up. The controversial ad, which came out yesterday, featured the slogan “Believe in something. Even if it means sacrificing everything” over a tightly cropped photo of Colin Kaepernick’s face that completely cut off his chin and forehead, not to mention his neck and the rest of his body. Outrage over the excessively zoomed-in photo erupted almost immediately, with thousands of formerly loyal Nike customers expressing how disgusted they were that the company would put out an ad that was basically just some eyes and a nose.  The backlash was especially brutal on Twitter, and many users called for a total boycott of Nike products: The sheer volume of the fallout over the polarizing ad has been absolutely devastating for Nike. Nike’s stock has already taken a hit, and with the backlash still raging, it’s safe to say that it’ll think twice before taking a photo of someone so close up ever again."
The Mystery Lives On: Researchers At Oxford Have Concluded That They’ll Never Know How Outback Steakhouse Bread Can Be So Dark Brown But Taste Regular,N/A,https://clickhole.com/the-mystery-lives-on-researchers-at-oxford-have-conclu-1826923911/,"It looks like one of nature’s greatest puzzles is destined to remain shrouded in mystery and confusion. Researchers at Oxford have concluded that they’ll never know how Outback Steakhouse bread can be so dark brown but taste regular. If you were hoping for a definitive explanation of how that bread manages to look like a big slab of wood but still taste like normal bread from the supermarket, we’re sorry. Looks like you’ll just have to continue biting into Outback bread and being surprised at how regular it tastes considering how dark brown it is forever. “Despite the great effort and resources we’ve put into understanding the incongruity between the abnormally dark color of Outback bread and its regular taste, decades of research have forced us to conclude that we will never find an adequate explanation,” said lead researcher Dr. Lawrence Knowles of Oxford’s department of chemistry. “Perhaps we will return to this riddle of the universe at some point in the future, when our technology and insight into the bread’s brownness in relation to its ordinary taste have developed further.” While it’s disappointing that scientists have yet to find a sufficient answer, the puzzle of Outback’s bread remains a beautiful mystery, destined to capture the imagination of humankind for generations to come. For now, it looks like we must move on and allow the question of how Outback’s complimentary bread can be so extremely dark brown but still have a regular taste to remain open—an unexplained marvel of the world, and a constant reminder of just how much about our universe we have yet to understand."
No Big News For Bagels: The Bagel Industry Just Issued Its Daily 600-Page Report On The State Of The Bagel Industry And Nothing Major Has Changed Since Yesterday,N/A,https://clickhole.com/no-big-news-for-bagels-the-bagel-industry-just-issued-1827000534/,"Bagel fans can take it easy today, because the bagel industry just issued its daily 600-page report on the state of bagels, and nothing big has changed since yesterday. The phonebook-sized volume, which is published every day in 76 countries around the world in 254 languages, reported this morning that pretty much everything in the bagel world remains relatively constant.  “Cream cheese is basically the same as before, and bagels still have holes in them most of the time. Nothing new to share,” the report states in a passage found on page 276, a little less than halfway through the massive publication. “Most bagels are round, which is consistent with our findings from yesterday,” reads another notable excerpt from a 150-page subsection of the report analyzing the shape of bagels. Well, looks like things are about the same for bagels. We’re looking forward to seeing if tomorrow’s 600-page volume reveals any meaningful bagel changes."
Environmental Win: Conservationists Are Taking White Rhinos Off The Endangered Species List After The Bronx Zoo Found A Bunch In The Back,N/A,https://clickhole.com/environmental-win-conservationists-are-taking-white-rh-1828313564/,"For years the prognosis for the critically endangered northern white rhino has been dire, but following an incredible new discovery, the future of the subspecies is now looking bright: Conservationists are taking the imperiled rhinos off the endangered species list after the Bronx Zoo just found a bunch of them in the back. Wow! What a fortunate break for these extraordinary creatures. Zoologists at the Bronx Zoo excitedly called a press conference yesterday to make the bombshell announcement that the northern white rhino, a subspecies thought to have a mere two surviving female members, is now no longer at risk for extinction after they found a big pile of them lying behind some boxes of janitorial supplies in a storage room. Though the rhinos were previously believed to be beyond the point of rescue, zoo officials say there are now more than enough of the animals to repopulate the subspecies to a viable level. “We found a whole boatload of them back there—probably 50 or 60 of the big bastards, easy,” said a spokesperson for the zoo, adding that the rhinos seemed pretty hungry but were otherwise more or less in good health. “Everybody can stop worrying about white rhinos now because we have plenty. They’ll be fine.” Huh. Well, great, then. Glad that’s solved. With the long-term survival of the northern white rhino now all but guaranteed, conservation groups will have millions of dollars in resources freed up to redirect toward protecting other critically endangered species. All in all, this represents a huge win not only for the rhinos but also for wildlife preservation efforts worldwide. Sweet!"
"Heartwarming: When This Subway Employee Had To Walk 20 Miles To Work Because He Couldn’t Afford A Car, The CEO Of Subway Drove Alongside Him To Cheer Him On",N/A,https://clickhole.com/heartwarming-when-this-subway-employee-had-to-walk-20-1828134369/,"If you think all corporate CEOs are heartless monsters who only care about their companies’ bottom lines, this story is going to make you think again: When a 27-year-old employee at Subway had to walk 20 miles to work because he couldn’t afford a car, the CEO of Subway drove alongside him to cheer him on. If you don’t think this is the most beautiful thing you’ve ever heard, you officially have no soul. This is a CEO who cares about his employees and isn’t afraid to show it. This beautiful story began when Dylan Derkson of Blairsville, Georgia told his manager at Subway about how he often had to walk to work from his home 20 miles away when his wife needed to drive their car to her night-shift job at another restaurant across town. It wasn’t long after that when Dylan got the surprise of a lifetime: He was setting out for his 20-mile trek one night around midnight when he saw Subway’s CEO waiting in front of his house in a rented Range Rover, honking his horn and waving a “You can do it, Dylan!” banner with a photo of Dylan walking along the side of the highway on it. The amazing CEO then began driving next to Dylan at a 2 mph crawl, calling out inspirational phrases to boost his employee’s morale as he made the long, difficult walk to Subway. That’s one selfless CEO! As the head of a massive corporation, he probably had other things he could have been doing, but it was more important to him to show a struggling employee that he cared. Several hours into the walk, Dylan nearly succumbed to exhaustion, and he asked the Subway CEO if he could sit in his car and drink some water for a few minutes. But the kindhearted executive refused to let Dylan give up, and instead gave him a pep talk to give him the motivation he needed to finish his 20-mile trek!  Six hours later, Dylan made it to Subway to start his shift, and it’s safe to say he must have been deeply grateful to the CEO for driving alongside him and cheering him on the whole way. This is what happens when a truly dedicated employee and a truly compassionate boss cross paths. If you’re tearing up, we don’t blame you!"
A Historic Summit: Donald Trump Just Finished A Marathon Day Of Diplomatic Talks With A Man In A Freddy Krueger Costume Who Introduced Himself As The King Of Scotland,N/A,https://clickhole.com/a-historic-summit-donald-trump-just-finished-a-maratho-1828638291/,"A historic diplomatic meeting took place today that could influence international politics for years to come: Donald Trump just finished a marathon day of diplomatic talks with a man in a Freddy Krueger costume who introduced himself as the king of Scotland. This may very well prove to be the foreign policy moment that defines Donald Trump’s presidency. The watershed talks began this morning at 6 a.m. when a man wearing a store-bought Freddy Krueger costume, complete with plastic mask and striped sweater, walked across the White House lawn and tapped his plastic hand-knives on an Oval Office window to get President Trump’s attention before pressing his lips against the glass and saying, “I’m Scotland’s king, let me in.” President Trump quickly got up and opened the window for his new ally. The man in the Freddy Krueger costume climbed through the window into the Oval Office, where he and President Trump sat down to have their pictures taken. The two men spent hours discussing international issues, including global trade and the looming threat of terrorism, before President Trump and the man dressed as Freddy Krueger emerged holding hands to greet the press. “I’m pleased to report that the king of Scotland and I have had a very productive and great conversation. He’s a very scary king, and Scotland should be proud,” President Trump told reporters as he continued to hold hands with the costumed stranger. “Our two nations shall become great allies, and it is my honor to announce today that I have committed 15,000 U.S. troops to the king of Scotland to help him protect his great nation.” “Yes, I love to be in charge of Scotland. They let me be the king because my face looks all burned up and I have a stylish black hat,” the man dressed as Freddy Krueger whispered into his microphone through his plastic mask to the field of reporters.  President Trump and the man claiming to be the king of Scotland then shook hands before the man climbed back out of the Oval Office window, tipping his charred black hat to the president and waggling the plastic knives on his gloves in farewell before trudging away across the White House lawn. While the ramifications of Donald Trump’s meeting with this man aren’t entirely clear yet, one thing is certain: Historians are going to be talking about it for generations."
Ultimate Disrespect: The White House Is Still Flying Its Flag Depicting John McCain Being Confused By A Pinecone,N/A,https://clickhole.com/ultimate-disrespect-the-white-house-is-still-flying-it-1828631287/,"In yet another sign of the animosity that existed between President Trump and the late politician, the White House is continuing to display its flag depicting John McCain being confused by a pinecone more than 48 hours after the senator’s death. It looks like Donald Trump is making it very clear that there was no love lost between himself and Senator McCain. While much of the country and the press celebrates McCain’s legacy as a maverick politician and war hero who endured torture in Vietnam, the Trump administration has shamelessly insisted on flying the polarizing banner, which depicts McCain looking at a pinecone with a question mark above his head—clearly implying that the deceased Arizona senator does not understand what pinecones are or what they are for.  President Trump’s refusal to lower the flag has drawn harsh criticism from both sides of the political aisle. House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Republican, called the flag a “deeply disrespectful” affront to McCain’s legacy that “maligns his basic knowledge of coniferous trees,” while Barack Obama, who defeated McCain in the 2008 presidential election, tweeted, “John McCain and I disagreed about many things, but he definitely knew what a pinecone was, and in the time I knew him he explained exactly how pinecones worked on several occasions.”  Despite numerous questions from the press, Trump has refused to indicate when, if ever, the White House will choose to take the flag down. For the time being, it seems that the Trump administration is hell-bent on implying that pinecones left John McCain feeling bewildered. The feud between the two men rages on, even after John McCain’s passing."

"Liberal Hypocrisy: When Obama Was President Democrats Were Okay With Him Being President, But When Trump Is President Suddenly It’s Wrong To Be President?",N/A,https://clickhole.com/liberal-hypocrisy-when-obama-was-president-democrats-w-1828462533/,"Liberal morons have no principles other than to hate on President Donald John Trump, so of course they’ll criticize everything he does for no reason. Case in point, Democrats loved it when their hero Barack Obama was president, but now that Trump is president it’s suddenly bad to be president? Make up your mind, liberal flip-floppers: Is it good to be president or bad to be president? Every day the hypocritical lamestream media attacks President Trump for living in the White House and being president, things they always praised Obama for doing. Liberal news outlets like the #FailingNewYorkTimes viciously slander our brave leader and say it would be good if Trump wasn’t president, completely forgetting they were all in favor of Obama being president. Two-faced libtards might pretend they don’t remember, but they elected Obama president not just once but twice! But President Trump gets elected president just once, and that’s not okay all of a sudden? Trump is even doing all the president things Obama was lauded for, like signing executive orders and being married to the first lady, yet it’s never good enough. #DisgustingCNN even criticized President Donald John Trump just for saying nice things about Vladimir Putin, even though Obama said nice things about many people while he was president, without a single complaint from Democrats. It seems that leftists will never be happy with Trump until there is no president, unless they change their minds of course and decide they once again want someone to be president. The double standard is shameful. Liberal hypocrisy has officially sunk to a new low."
Intelligence Setback: The CIA Is In Crisis Mode After ISIS Made Its Instagram Private,N/A,https://clickhole.com/intelligence-setback-the-cia-is-in-crisis-mode-after-i-1828313318/,"America’s intelligence community suffered a massive setback today that experts say will have massive ramifications throughout the world of counterterrorism: The CIA has gone into full-on crisis mode after ISIS set its Instagram account to private. This sounds pretty devastating. One of America’s best intel sources on ISIS has officially gone dark. “Since the Islamic State first got an Insta in 2013, the CIA has relied on analysis of its brunch pics and selfies for critical information regarding the terror group’s operations and whereabouts,” said CIA director Gina Haspel in an emergency press conference held at the agency’s headquarters in Langley, Virginia. “Right now, we’re only able to see the Islamic State’s display name and a thumbnail of its profile picture, which is simply not enough information to combat these violent jihadists, so if anyone is somehow able to see the Islamic State’s most recent Insta posts, we urge them to contact us with screenshots as soon as possible.” This is extremely scary news, and things are looking pretty dire for the CIA right now. Here’s hoping it can start following the private ISIS Instagram soon, because until it does, our nation’s entire intelligence community is essentially flying blind. "
Incredible Innovation: This Device Called The ‘Catapult’ Allows You To Shoot Things Over Walls And We Are So Here For It,N/A,https://clickhole.com/incredible-innovation-this-device-called-the-catapult-1828143358/,"None Put down your mutton and your flagon of ale, because there’s a brand-new invention on the scene that is absolutely changing the game: It’s called a “catapult,” it lets you shoot things over walls, and we are totally HERE FOR IT! Seriously, the catapult might just be the greatest innovation since the wheel—it’s THAT good. Basically, a catapult is a long-range ballistic weapon that is kind of similar to a slingshot, except it’s absolutely huge! That means you can use this bad boy to launch just about anything into the vulnerable castle walls of an enemy during a coordinated assault, and yeah, we mean anything. Large boulders? Yep. Cabbages? Duh! Rotting corpses of loved ones that are taking up space in the street? YAS, QUEEN! Anyone who has ever taken part in siege warfare is definitely going to go nuts for the way this cool contraption loads up very heavy things and then hurls those things way far away. The catapult is our latest obsession, and we can’t wait to see it in action. Let’s face it, everyone has something they’d like to see flying far into the distance, whether it’s a flaming projectile for an invading army or just a fussy, gout-ridden baby that won’t stop crying. But historically, the only things that could really be launched into the air were arrows or small letters that could fit in the talon of a messenger bird. With the catapult, not only do you get to send items of any size hurtling off in a specific direction with ease, but you get to do it with a big, intimidating wooden mechanism that has a name like “Warbringer” or “Oblivion” or “Sky Cleaver.” How epic is that? Get excited, because it won’t be long before the skies are full of crazy projectiles launched by catapults—this thing is DEFINITELY catching on. If you have any ideas for items you’d like to lob straight into the clouds with a catapult, let us know in the comments below!

Must Be Nice: These Donkeys Seem To Have No Idea That The Castle Is On Fire Right Now,N/A,https://clickhole.com/must-be-nice-these-donkeys-seem-to-have-no-idea-that-t-1827808274/,"None When the world around you is literally burning, ignorance truly is bliss. That at least seems to be the case for His Highness’s donkeys, which, from the looks of it, apparently have absolutely no idea that the castle is on fire right now. Must be nice, donkeys. Must be nice. After an army of enemy knights sieged the castle and set it ablaze, sending slaves and nobles alike running for their lives, you’d think that all the commotion would at the very least provoke some sort of reaction from the donkeys down in the stables. But nope. In the intensely chaotic few minutes since the attack, the donkeys have remained utterly unfazed, each of them just standing there blank-faced as always, casually chewing on grass as if Lord Letholdus weren’t agonizingly burning alive just five cubits away. The donkeys could be running for freedom right now, considering that the serf boy who tends to them left the gate open while fleeing the inferno, but they seem wholly disinterested in doing anything but idling in place like morons, lazily swatting at flies with their tails. It is genuinely mind-boggling how chill they’re being.  Look, we get that the donkeys work hard and are probably tired from pulling around wagons all day, but really? Do they seriously not notice what’s happening right now? Are they really not gonna let out one single hee-haw, or huddle together to comfort each other, or react in any goddamn way whatsoever? The whole castle is burning down right in front of them! An enemy knight just ran off with the princess over his shoulder! This is some seriously crazy shit! And if you’re thinking that maybe this is just how animals react in these types of situations, think again, because pretty much every other animal in the kingdom is going completely apeshit right now. The big black horse with red eyes everyone is afraid of booked it out of his pen as soon as he smelled smoke. The alligators rocketed out of the moat and waddled off into the woods as fast as they could. Even the minstrel’s blind, legless orangutan had the good sense to put on his sad-face mask and somersault for the exit. But then you’ve got these incredibly calm donkeys that either just straight-up don’t give a shit or are so breathtakingly dumb that they truly do not realize something bad is happening. In a weird way, it’s honestly kind of inspiring. At this point, the entire village is pretty much engulfed in flames and no one knows where the king and queen are. We may very well have new rulers now. Life as we know it will likely never be the same. And yet, these donkeys do not seem to care about any of that. Not one bit. Whatever, donkeys. You do you.

After Wendy’s mocked Burger King for freezing its beef, Burger King’s CEO responded with a video of him killing himself. Damn, that’s how you throw shade! Well done, BK.  Flame-broiled beef, meet flame war. Wendy’s started the tiff by tweeting, “Wendy’s beef is never frozen, unlike Burger King. Looks like we get the crown for freshest ingredients.” That tweet seemed like a perfect burn on Wendy’s fast food rivals, but just an hour later, Burger King responded with a video showing its CEO silently staring directly into the camera for 10 seconds and then shooting himself in the head. Epic! That’s how you win the battle of the burgers! It’s going to be hard for Wendy’s to top that public suicide, but you can bet it’ll be posting more sass on Twitter before long.

The Rock Dwayne Johnson Just BLASTED His Car Through The Wall Of This Daycare Center To Show The Toddlers His Long, Gray Wizard’s Beard",N/A,https://clickhole.com/he-did-kindly-arrive-the-rock-dwayne-johnson-just-blas-1827761123/,"Yes it is! At last you will know true joy and unending rapture in the form of this story of heartwarming joy and celebrity kindness: International mega-man The Rock Dwayne Johnson just BLASTED his car through the wall of a daycare center to show the toddlers his long, gray wizard’s beard! He did kindly arrive! Every celebrity has a huge brain, but only some of them have a huge heart and The Rock Dwayne Johnson is one of them! The toddlers were playing with blocks and dollhouses and looking at easy-to-read picture books when all of a sudden there was a massive crash as The Rock Dwayne Johnson did kindly arrive by BLASTING his car straight through the wall sporting a gray wizard’s beard that dangled down from his face all the way to the floor. Johnson Rock got out of his car and immediately began showing off his beautiful long beard for all the lucky children to see. Truly joyous in every way! There’s simply no doubt that he did kindly arrive! He did kindly arrive! Hollywood’s own glittering son Dwayne Rock The Johnson let all the toddlers touch his long beard that made him look like an ancient conjurer, and Hot Rock Johnny even pointed at the long beard to show all the children where it was! The Jumanji even let the children line up one at a time and whisper their names in his ear. Once The Rock Dwayne Johnson had learned all the children’s names, he waved his beard around over his head! You may think this is too wonderful for any celebrity to ever do, but it is all in a day’s work for Rock Johnson: The Dwayne. Now that’s the way to kindly arrive, and he did kindly arrive! It’s safe to say that these toddlers could definitely “smell what the Dwayne was Johnson” and that he was cooking up hot Jumanji because of his long beard that all the children got to see! When it was all over, Wayne The Dwayne (Rock And John-Dwayne The Johansson) got back in his car and did kindly leave after he had so kindly arrived! He did kindly arrive, and these toddlers will always be able to tell the story of when Jonathan Dwayne-Rock The Jumanji did kindly arrive to show them his mile-long wizard beard to the delight of all! He did kindly arrive! CORRECTION: A previous version of this article stated that The Rock Dwayne Johnson did not kindly arrive. He did kindly arrive. We regret the error."
Absolutely Amazing: Biblical Scholars Have Discovered That Christ’s Eyes Were Much Lower Down On His Face Than Previously Believed,N/A,https://clickhole.com/absolutely-amazing-biblical-scholars-have-discovered-t-1828313382/,"A groundbreaking study was published today that will forever alter the way Christians and non-believers alike think about the historical Jesus Christ. Biblical scholars have discovered that Christ’s eyes were much lower on his face than previously believed! Wow. What an amazing discovery about the man who would found one of the world’s most influential religions. “After years of research, we can conclusively state that Jesus Christ’s eyes were a full three inches lower on his face than previous church doctrine suggested,” announced Dr. Michelle Casey at the Northwestern School of Theology, in which she cited copious evidence across several fields, including biblical exegesis and careful analysis of Ancient Roman documents, which all suggest that Jesus Christ’s eyes were roughly level with his chin. “While the world may continue to debate whether or not Christ was truly the Messiah, there is no disputing that his eyes were a few inches below his mouth and he was probably able to lick his own eyes if he wanted to.” Dr. Casey says that the key piece of evidence in the watershed study is this stunning, recently unearthed depiction of Jesus Christ found at the grave of early Christian cultists in Rome, which clearly shows Christ’s eyes below his nose and just barely above his mouth. This discovery has already had widespread ramifications. The Vatican has begun destroying all of its paintings and sculptures depicting Christ with regular eyes and is making plans to replace them with accurate representations in which the Messiah’s eyes are located below his lips. No doubt other Christian institutions will soon follow suit. It’s safe to say that the world’s understanding of Jesus Christ will never be the same!"
Poseidon Incarnate: This Little Boy At The Beach Is Standing At The Shoreline With His Bathing Suit Down Peeing Directly Into The Waves,N/A,https://clickhole.com/poseidon-incarnate-this-little-boy-at-the-beach-is-sta-1827701702/,"Hark! The God of the Sea is risen! The boundless power of Poseidon has found its corporeal home in this little boy at the beach, who is standing at the shoreline with his bathing suit down and peeing directly into the waves. Ah! Gaze upon the sun’s rays glittering in this little boy’s Capri Sun-infused urine stream, and know that you are in the presence of an Olympian god born once more. Poseidon has returned in an earthly form to look out on the great expanse of his oceanic domain along the shores of Spring Lake, New Jersey, and he is relieving himself amid the ocean spray for all to see.  Creatures of the sea, kneel before your maritime master, whose Ben 10 swim trunks now lay in a heap at his feet, his posterior bare for the crowds of vacationers and beachcombers to witness as he urinates into the low-tide currents. Try as this boy’s grandmother might to usher him back to the family’s camp of beach chairs and have him use a boardwalk restroom instead of his watery kingdom, she is destined to fail, as this young vessel of Poseidon speaks only the language of the waves, and would spend all eternity in the underworld before obeying the bidding of a mortal. O! How glorious!  The contents of this boy’s bladder are as golden as the trident that called forth the storms that punished Odysseus so long ago! The King of the Oceans is alive and well in this little boy, and the boogie boarders surfing directly into the path of his urinary release—no doubt beckoned by his unbridled power—are a sure sign that his control over the ocean and its inhabitants is as mighty as ever. The gods triumph once again! We worship you, O ruler of the seas, O Poseidon made flesh!"
Public Health Win: Coca-Cola Is Releasing A New Line Of Sprite That Turns Blue If Anyone Shits In The Sprite,N/A,https://clickhole.com/public-health-win-coca-cola-is-releasing-a-new-line-of-1828263729/,"The Coca-Cola Company just made the world a little safer for the public today by releasing a new line of Sprite that immediately turns blue if anyone shits in it. It’s incredible to see a company willing to take measures to protect its product from contamination! “For the first time ever, checking to see whether your Sprite has feces in it is as simple as checking the color of your soda,” said a statement posted on Coca-Cola’s Twitter account this morning, in which it boasted that this was the first time ever that Sprite drinkers were safe from ingesting human waste. “Our customers will never again have to drink a Sprite and then spend the rest of their lives wondering if someone secretly defecated into it. From here on out, if you see that your Sprite has turned blue, you’ll know for certain that someone took a dump in it, and you can use this information to make an informed choice about whether or not to consume it.” This is definitely amazing! In the past, every sip of Sprite was a dangerous roll of the dice that could result in drinking soda contaminated by a mischief-maker who shit in your beverage while you weren’t looking. But it looks like those days are gone forever now that consumers can just check to see if their Sprite is bright blue or not and solve the mystery for themselves. Thanks, Coke! It’s going to be so nice to chug a Sprite without fear of fecal contamination. Public health FTW!"
Crisis In The Church: Pope Francis Apparently Doesn’t Realize Everyone Can See Him If He Gets Naked Inside The Glass Booth In The Popemobile,N/A,https://clickhole.com/crisis-in-the-church-pope-francis-apparently-doesn-t-r-1828251376/,"Another controversy enveloped the Catholic Church yesterday when it became apparent to the world that Pope Francis apparently doesn’t realize that everyone can see him if he gets naked inside the glass booth in the Popemobile. After bidding farewell to a crowd of over 80,000 worshippers following a Papal Audience on Wednesday, Pope Francis climbed into the transparent booth of his Popemobile, shut the door, and immediately began to disrobe, completely unaware that the 3-inch plastic glass surrounding him, though able to withstand explosive blasts, was doing nothing to hide his nudity. Members of the astonished crowd reported that, once free of his papal clothes, Pope Francis kicked them into a corner before sitting down fully nude and letting out a huge sigh. Over the course of the next several minutes, horrified Catholics looked on as Pope Francis paced around the see-through chamber, periodically spreading his legs apart and bending over in some kind of hamstring stretch that displayed his bare buttocks to tens of thousands of people. Blissfully unaware that the mass of devout Christians outside could see his nude body on full display, the Pope then reportedly began slapping his bare belly like a drum and absentmindedly scratching his crotch as the Popemobile slowly drove him back to the Papal Apartment. It’s definitely unclear how the Church is going to recover from this public relations nightmare, but Vatican officials need to explain to the Pope as soon as possible that any time he presses his nude body up against the walls of the Popemobile, he is displaying his bare chest and genitals to the entire world. Hopefully, they can get their act together by Sunday’s mass and make sure Pope Francis knows that he can’t take his clothes off until he gets home."
A Major Advantage: Microsoft Has Released A New Xbox Controller With Pre-Mushed-In Buttons That You Can Make Your Friend Use Since It’s Your House,N/A,https://clickhole.com/a-major-advantage-microsoft-has-released-a-new-xbox-co-1827556801/,"Every gamer is always looking for that competitive edge, which is why this latest product is bound to be a big seller: Microsoft released a new Xbox controller with pre-mushed-in buttons that you can make your friend use since it’s your house.  If you play video games competitively, this is one piece of gear you absolutely need to own. “Our engineers worked tirelessly to cake each button of our new controller with crumbs and goo to help them stick when your friend pushes them down, assuming he can even press them at all, and because it’s your house, your opponents will have no choice but to pick between this piece of junk and your equally crappy steering wheel controller while you use the good one,” said Phil Spencer, Microsoft’s vice president of gaming, in a demonstration earlier today in which he showcased several features of the miserable new controller, including a faulty joystick that sporadically makes your friend’s characters randomly drift to the left side of the screen for seemingly no reason and a loose B button that only responds once every five times your friend presses it. “Forcing your friends to play with this borderline unusable controller will give you the competitive advantage you need to take your gaming to the next level, and if your friends don’t like it, tough shit—it’s your house and you get to pick the controller.” Microsoft’s new controller also comes sold in a multi-pack so that players can steamroll up to three helpless gamers at a time before those friends decide not to come over anymore because their character keeps drifting to the left and they’re no longer having fun. It looks like it won’t be long until the world’s best gamers are making their friends use this dysfunctional piece of trash in order to achieve more victories than ever before!"
The Experience Of A Lifetime: Beyoncé Brought A Lucky Fan Down Into The Sewer And Let Them Sing ‘You’re A Grand Old Flag’,N/A,https://clickhole.com/the-experience-of-a-lifetime-beyonce-brought-a-lucky-f-1827556779/,"Last night, Beyoncé proved yet again that she is the most flawless person in the entire world when she invited a lucky fan into the sewer and let her sing “You’re A Grand Old Flag.” Just when you thought Beyoncé couldn’t get any more incredible, she goes ahead and does something amazing like this. The unforgettable experience began when Beyoncé stuck her head out of a sewer grate and invited 24-year-old Melissa Kuzmic down into the sewer with her. Although any member of the Beyhive would be over the moon just standing in the same sewage as Beyoncé, the Queen didn’t stop there. After leading Melissa through several dark and cramped tunnels, Beyoncé turned to her lucky fan and said, “It’s time to sing ‘You’re A Grand Old Flag’ now,” before standing motionlessly and waiting for her to begin. Totally. Freaking. AWESOME!! Could anyone be luckier than Melissa? As Beyoncé and her awe-struck super fan stood ankle-deep in sewer water, the pop star pulled out a Ziploc bag of wet baby carrots and started rustling around in it as Melissa began to sing the patriotic march. It’s hard to imagine Melissa will ever forget singing “You’re A Grand Old Flag” while Beyoncé stared at her vacantly, chomping on fistfuls of baby carrots. When Melissa finished singing, Beyoncé even generously took the time to look her in the eye and say, “It’s over now,” before trudging away deeper into the sewer. It’s the kind of thrill that Melissa will almost certainly cherish for the rest of her life! Wow. What an incredibly special thing for a Beyoncé fan to experience. A mega-talented artist like Beyoncé already has so much on her plate, but she still made time to listen to Melissa sing “You’re A Grand Old Flag” in the sewer. All hail Queen Bey!"
Resistance Win: This Restaurant Just Refused To Serve Steve Bannon Dinner Because It Closes At 3 p.m.,N/A,https://clickhole.com/resistance-win-this-restaurant-just-refused-to-serve-s-1828084492/,"Sorry alt-right idiots, but if you support President Donald DRUMPF (a.k.a. President DUMP/DRIMPF), then you shouldn’t expect to be able to eat your meals in peace anymore. Conservative troll Steve Bannon found that out the hard way when a restaurant turned him away because it closes at 3 p.m. Take that, fascists! If you promote a hateful, racist agenda, there’s no way you’re going to get to eat dinner at a restaurant that only serves breakfast and lunch. Imagine the look on Steve Bannon’s face when he grabbed the doorknob of the Maple Diner after 7 p.m. and discovered that the door was locked. Bannon no doubt regretted helping Trump get elected when he glanced through the window and saw that the lights were out and all the employees had gone home, leaving him without a meal. As an extra-sassy insult to Bannon, the restaurant owner had even flipped the “open” sign on the door around to the other side so it said “closed.” So perfect! Trump supporters, you’ve been put on notice because the hours of operation are listed on the diner’s website and they clearly say 6 a.m.-3 p.m. Breitbart is no doubt going to throw a hissy fit and write an article complaining about the restaurant’s uncivil behavior, but conservaturds like Bannon have to learn that actions have consequences. When your political policies hurt people, you simply don’t deserve to eat at a restaurant that isn’t open at the moment. And Steve Bannon better not even think of trying to eat there on Thanksgiving or Christmas because the restaurant isn’t open at all on those holidays. Sorry, Steve, but that’s just the way it is! Resistance win!"
Changing Digital Economy: The FDNY Has Laid Off 80 Percent Of Its Firefighters Because It Isn’t Getting Enough Traffic On FDNY.Org,N/A,https://clickhole.com/changing-digital-economy-the-fdny-has-laid-off-80-perc-1827065499/,"It’s always tough to watch a beloved institution decimated by the changing digital economy, but unfortunately, we’ve just seen another incidence of this sad phenomenon: The New York City Fire Department has laid off 80 percent of its firefighters because it isn’t getting enough traffic on FDNY.org. Heartbreaking. It looks like no one is immune to the merciless forward march of the internet. FDNY commissioner Daniel A. Nigro announced the massive layoffs this morning, saying that though he respected each and every one of New York’s firefighters, the stark reality was that the department’s web traffic had slowed dramatically and was taking a massive toll on revenue, leaving him with no choice but to make significant cuts to firefighting personnel.  “Every single firefighter at our organization has done incredible work making rescues and responding to emergencies during their tenure here, but it isn’t 2005 anymore, and we need to tighten our belt and get serious about connecting with an online audience,” Nigro wrote in a memo released to the FDNY earlier this morning, in which he explained that the fire department’s survival depended on digital engagement with younger demographics. “We’re incredibly proud of the work we’ve done putting out fires in New York City for over 150 years, but if the FDNY is going to remain relevant and financially viable, the time has come to de-emphasize firefighting and turn our focus to generating online revenue from page views and branded content on the department’s home page.” Nigro added that in order to grow the department’s social reach, it plans to use the resources freed up by laying off staff members to create short, low-budget viral videos about fire safety as well as longer-form content like “The Daily Blaze: Today In FDNY History” that will keep users on their web page and generate the ad revenue the department needs.  The commissioner said that he was looking forward to the remaining staff turning their attention to “exciting branded initiatives” such as the FDNY’s new digital partnership with Sprite called #UnSpriteYourEmergency, which will provide weekly multimedia content about how to keep Sprite products safe in disaster situations. This is truly devastating. The ruthless tides of modern business have claimed yet another much-loved organization. Our hearts go out to the firefighters who lost their jobs and to anyone whose safety will be affected by the FDNY’s lack of funds, but hopefully the FDNY will be able to do good things with its leaner staff and new focus on web traffic goals.

"Dangerous Teen Trend: It’s Called ‘Worrying That Donald Trump’s Supreme Court Nominee Will Overturn Vital U.S. Civil Rights Decisions,’ And It’s What Millions Of U.S. Adolescents Are OBSESSED With Today",N/A,https://clickhole.com/dangerous-teen-trend-it-s-called-worrying-that-donald-1827907977/,"Watch out, parents, because there’s a new dangerous teen trend on the rise: It’s called “Worrying That Donald Trump’s Supreme Court Nominee Will Overturn Vital U.S. Civil Rights Decisions,” and studies show that more and more teenagers are taking part in it. According to recent studies, as many as one in three teenagers reported being existentially concerned with Trump’s Supreme Court nomination of Brett Kavanaugh and his effect on voting rights, racial discrimination, and abortion in America. Experts say that the dangerous fad has negative effects on the well-being of adolescents, who are often choosing to become extremely anxious about circuit court judge Kavanaugh’s impending confirmation at all hours of the day and night, which has a negative impact of their schoolwork and sleep patterns. It you’re the parent of a teenager, it’s important for you to look for the signs that your son or daughter might be participating in the dangerous fad of desperately fearing the end of American democracy. Have you seen your teen just looking at their phone, saying, “Oh my god, oh my god, it’s so bad”? Have you noticed them spending increasing amounts of time online, reading message boards that will elaborate just how easily Roe v. Wade could be overturned? If so, then your teen might have recently been convinced by one of their peers to fit in with the “cool kids” by submitting to a crippling fear regarding the future of civil rights in the United States.  Teens are also reportedly meeting up after school to speculate about possible dystopian political futures. So keep track of where your kids are after class lets out, because it’s possible that they’re associating with other kids who might be encouraging them to spiral into a deep depression over widespread voter suppression and institutionalized misogyny. Be vigilant and talk to your teen about this hazardous trend ASAP!"
Entering A New Market: Listerine Has Asked Anyone Who Is Planning To Clean The Viscera Off A Newborn Baby In A Bucket Of Mouthwash To Choose Listerine,N/A,https://clickhole.com/entering-a-new-market-listerine-has-asked-anyone-who-i-1826873473/,"If you’re an expectant mother trying to put together the perfect birth plan, one of the biggest names in oral hygiene has a new initiative you might find interesting: Listerine is asking anyone who intends to clean the viscera off their newborn baby in a bucket of mouthwash to choose Listerine. Wow! If it turns out there are people who are set on washing a newborn in a bucket of antiseptic mouthwash, Listerine is definitely gonna have the market cornered. Listerine delivered the announcement via a series of new ads this week, all of which plead Listerine’s case for why its product would be the superior choice for people currently planning on sterilizing their newborns in buckets with mouthwash. Many of the ads boast that Listerine is the best oral hygiene product on the market for washing amniotic fluid off of infants, noting that competitors like Colgate haven’t even considered such an application for their products and therefore just aren’t brands that new moms can trust. Check out one of Listerine’s new billboards promoting the initiative below: Listerine also issued a statement this morning making an emotional appeal to expectant mothers to give their mouthwash a try. “Childbirth is one of the most special experiences a woman can have, and Listerine is proud to stand with new moms by offering a wide array of oral hygiene products that are ideal for washing down newborns in a pail,” said the company in a press release, adding that the tingling sensation Listerine imparts feels absolutely exhilarating on a newly delivered baby’s skin. “Whether you’re a nurse tasked with cleaning up infants at a hospital or a mom simply giving birth directly into a three-gallon bucket, Listerine is the perfect choice for welcoming a little one into the world.” This is a bold marketing play for a company primarily associated with keeping mouths clean, but if it works out, you can expect other mouthwash companies to follow suit with newborn-sterilization initiatives of their own. Whatever happens, this is nonetheless an exciting development for soon-to-be moms who want their newborns to start off life clean, minty, and in a bucket. "
"Privacy Violation: If You’ve Started Noticing
Bananas That Look Like You, You’re Not The Only Facebook User Whose Data Has
Been Sold To Chiquita",N/A,https://clickhole.com/privacy-violation-if-you-ve-started-noticing-bananas-t-1826925451/,"Despite repeated promises to take better care of user data, it seems like Facebook is up to its old tricks again. If you’ve been seeing bananas with your face at the supermarket, you’re not the only one. Facebook admitted that it’s sold user data to the Chiquita banana corporation, and now millions of people are encountering bananas that look like them in the produce aisle.  So much for giving users more control over their data.  Privacy advocates are complaining that Facebook users never agreed to have banana doppelgängers of themselves bred by Chiquita, and that uploading your photo to Facebook shouldn’t give it any legal right to create bananas that look like you. Sadly, Mark Zuckerberg has shown that he’s willing to put profits ahead of what the public wants, and now any stranger can find out exactly what you look like just by purchasing a banana in the shape of your face at pretty much any supermarket. Facebook has once again broken the public’s trust, but it remains to be seen whether this scandal is enough to get users to finally abandon the social media giant. People may be upset at the moment, but it’s possible that eventually they’ll accept being turned into bananas as just another cost of using social media."
Heartbreaking: This Buck-Toothed Gorilla Is Too Dumb-Looking To Ever Scare Poachers Away From His Children,N/A,https://clickhole.com/heartbreaking-this-buck-toothed-gorilla-is-too-dumb-lo-1826907101/,"It’s a sad reality that poachers often target the young of endangered animals, whose only line of defense is the mother or father looking after it. This is true especially for a species as threatened with extinction as the mountain gorilla, which is why this story is just so incredibly heart-wrenching: This buck-toothed gorilla is too dumb-looking to ever scare poachers away from its children. Absolutely devastating. In their rapidly shrinking environment, this gorilla’s young may need to depend on their father for protection from wildlife traffickers looking to sell them on the black market, which is tragic because he just looks way too stupid to threaten anyone. His uneven front teeth are sticking out over his lip and the fur on his head resembles the closest thing to a bowl cut a gorilla could have, meaning that poachers who want to trap his offspring will likely laugh and ignore him altogether while kidnapping his young. For a species that’s already critically threatened, this gorilla’s dorky teeth and the fact that no hunter would view them as a threat to anyone’s safety in a million years is truly sad. To make matters worse, male gorillas display dominance by bearing their teeth, which makes this specific male’s undeniably goofy overbite even more catastrophic: If poachers try to come for his young, his biological instinct will be to flash the very buckteeth that will convince them to take a picture they will inevitably caption “Check out this dipshit gorilla.” He may also try to beat his chest, which, for this feral Poindexter, just looks astoundingly dumb, like an oversize Chuckie Finster throwing a temper tantrum. Hunters who encounter him will probably laugh at the fact that he seems to have some kind of lisp as far as gorillas go, wonder how a dweeby-looking gorilla like him even found a mate in the first place, and then shoot his children with tranquilizer darts. Wow. The fact that this buck-toothed gorilla looks so comically dumb is a tragedy for wildlife conservation. As a result, his young are basically just sitting ducks. All we can do is hope that other gorillas are better equipped to protect their offspring, because this family of gorillas are goners."

In an ominous Facebook post, the cheese-cracker brand declared that people would rue the day they let Cheese Nips play second fiddle to their competitor Cheez-It. It’s not clear what Cheese Nips means by that, but it can’t be good. Read the message for yourself, but be warned, it’s pretty chilling: Initially, some commenters on the post speculated that perhaps Cheese Nips was only pretending to be angry as part of a marketing stunt, but the snack-food company quickly responded with comments of its own insisting it was dead serious, warning that there will soon be “weeping and gnashing of teeth all throughout the land” and that those who have purchased Cheez-Its in the past will find themselves “desperately pining for death.” Yikes. Cheese Nips is not messing around. While it’s still uncertain what, exactly, Cheese Nips is planning to do, the company has made it painstakingly clear that no one will be spared its wrath, whatever form it may take. We’re already regretting not buying more Cheese Nips, and we can only hope that it will come to its senses and decide to show consumers some mercy. "

Almost five years later, the show’s Facebook and Twitter accounts still exist, but only as mere shadows of their former selves. Which is why ClickHole has decided to step up and restore Dexter’s withering social media presence to its former glory.  ATTENTION, SHOWTIME: ClickHole will now audition to take over as admin of the official Dexter Facebook and Twitter accounts. Throughout the day, we will be posting examples on Facebook and Twitter of the amazing viral content we would share as the rightful admin of the Dexter Facebook and Twitter accounts, demonstrating for Showtime and the entire world once and for all that the Dexter social media accounts are better off in ClickHole’s hands. Here are the facts, Showtime: The official Dexter Facebook page’s massive, 12-million-user following is at present largely dormant—it’s been left unimpressed by the page’s infrequent and lackluster Dexter content that primarily consists of annual birthday posts for actor Michael C. Hall:  And the official Dexter Twitter account’s massive 650,000-follower count is similarly untapped thanks to the account’s endless stream of uninspired posts advertising “killer deals” on Dexter merch:  Not to mention the stretch of time in 2017 when both accounts stopped posting Dexter content altogether and became mere conduits for promoting the new season of Twin Peaks.  Admit it, Showtime: Dexter’s once-great Facebook and Twitter accounts have languished under your inadequate stewardship. These pages used to be social media juggernauts, but now they have been reduced to ruins. Give ClickHole control of these pages, and we will make them everything they once were, and more. It’s time these accounts had an admin that could take advantage of the show’s 13 million social media followers by posting only the best Dexter content that is guaranteed to go viral and generate millions of dollars in ad revenue. It is ClickHole’s destiny to be that admin. Showtime executives, we hope you’re watching. Go to ClickHole’s Facebook and Twitter accounts and bear witness to our superior Dexter content and put us in charge. The future of the official Dexter Facebook and Twitter accounts depends on it. "
Social Media Misfire: Applebee’s Has Apologized After Tweeting That 9/11 Was A ‘Big Mood’ With A Picture Of A Hamburger ,N/A,https://clickhole.com/social-media-misfire-applebee-s-has-apologized-after-t-1826985044/,"Brands, take note. Here’s a lesson in how NOT to tweet. Applebee’s just had to issue an apology after tweeting that 9/11 was a “big mood” with a picture of a hamburger. Someone’s definitely getting fired over this. It all started when Applebee’s proved once again that brands should leave the memes to everyone else by lobbing this ill-advised tweet onto the timelines of their 636,000 followers: It’s still unclear what Applebee’s was trying to say by referring to the September 11 terrorist attacks as a “big mood” or what the accompanying picture of an unadorned hamburger had to do with it all, but it sure is regretting it now. The fast-casual restaurant’s ill-advised foray into Twitter memes was immediately met with a public outcry and calls for the company to apologize, which it eventually did: Yikes. This is a social media fail for the ages. Maybe time to log off, Applebee’s."
Shameful: ‘InStyle’ Magazine Is Getting Slammed For Photoshopping A Perfect Hourglass Figure Onto Kate Upton’s Ultrasound,N/A,https://clickhole.com/shameful-instyle-magazine-is-getting-slammed-for-pho-1826385780/,"Well, this is disappointing, even if it’s sadly not much of a surprise: InStyle magazine is getting justifiably slammed for photoshopping a perfect hourglass figure onto Kate Upton’s ultrasound. Ugh. When will magazines learn that this is not okay? InStyle, a long-running women’s fashion magazine, published the offending photoshop in its most recent issue, accompanying its feature on Kate Upton’s pregnancy with an ultrasound of her fetus clearly doctored to have an impossibly perfect hourglass shape. Some airbrushing of minor blemishes is par for the course in the magazine world, but this utterly ridiculous editing job gives Upton’s second-trimester fetus a waistline that makes her look like a Barbie doll. Backlash has been swift and merciless from InStyle’s readership, which was quick to point out that the cartoonishly proportioned ultrasound image appeared in the same issue as an interview in which Sandra Bullock criticizes the toxic effect that retouched images have on women’s self-esteem. InStyle clearly didn’t take Bullock’s message to heart, because just 10 pages later editors were happy to run a photoshop of a fetus with completely unrealistic measurements for no better reason than to sell a few more copies of their magazine. This is absolutely shameful. InStyle might talk a big game about accepting all body types, but its photoshop of Kate’s unborn child shows that its commitment to profits might be just a bit stronger than its commitment to body positivity. Hopefully the magazine learns a lesson from this debacle and figures out that all fetuses look amazing, no matter the size of their waistlines."

Surfing may be tubular, but you know what isn’t tubular? Plotting with Russia to hack our democracy with a computer virus and cheating Nasty Woman Hillary (Nasty = Brave) #TheNotoriousHRC out of her presidency that she deserved #ShePresidentsisted. Members of the #Resistance, we are at war with the United States and cannot tarry needlessly watching this surfer perform a flawless vertical backhand snap until Putin’s Puppet (Donald John DUMP [Trump/Drumpf]) is forcibly removed from the White House #MuellerTime #HowIMetYourMueller #FerrisMuellersDayOffToImpeachTrump. Your complicity grows deeper with every surfing GIF you view. As you sit idle, gawking at this savage wipeout, Adolf Trumpler is taking advantage of your inaction by literally burning the Constitution to get rid of the emoluments clause (holy rule banning Trump hotel) and lusting to do incest on his beautiful daughter Ivanka #HornyForDaughter #JealousOfJared #SheWentToJared. This is your final chance to do the right thing, turn away from these radical off-the-hook surfing GIFs, and rejoin the battle against the orange tyrant. You monsters. You’re either with the #Resistance or against us, and by watching these amazing surfers you’ve revealed yourself as a traitor to our cause. The Russian oligarch who bought you the computer you’re using to look at surfing GIFs won’t be able to save you from our righteous fury. The blue wave of vengeance coming to destroy you will make the gnarly wave this surfer is riding seem as small as Drumpler’s tiny hands by comparison. As soon as Mueller is done impeaching Trimpus, we’re going to unleash his legal powers on you to get you impeached also. Your surfboard-loving ass is going to prison, you #MAGAmoron. Enjoy saying “cowabunga” while you still can."
"Marketing Win: Ray-Ban Won An Award
For Its Incredible ‘Ray-Ban 90% Off True Authentic Ray-Bans
Just $19.99’ Social Media Ad Campaign",N/A,https://clickhole.com/marketing-win-ray-ban-won-an-award-for-its-incredible-1826873876/,"Ray-Ban won top honors recently at the Cannes Lions advertising festival, receiving an award for its groundbreaking campaign “Ray-Ban 90% Off True Authentic Ray-Bans Just $19.99,” which took social media by storm with ads for heavily discounted designer sunglasses. To attract customers, Ray-Ban posted sepia-toned ads on Facebook and Instagram, informing users that “Ray-Ban official sunglasses priced at large discount one day only.” It’s a message that resonated with consumers, who were eager to get usually expensive Ray-Bans for a fraction of the price. Sales skyrocketed so dramatically that the Ray-Ban website was overloaded with traffic, forcing the company to redirect shoppers to Chinese websites that Ray-Ban hired to help collect all the credit card numbers people were submitting. “Here at Ray-Ban, we were trying to tell the story of our historic brand, about how Ray-Ban top quality shades were so cheap buy one get one free just $20 U.S. currency marked down from €195 euros,” Ray-Ban marketing director Nicholas Alfonso said in his acceptance speech. “Social media was the answer to that marketing problem. Posting a beige photo of sunglasses turned out to be a great way to spread the word that real Ray-Bans were so cheap amazing price for 24 hours only must click now to receive deal.”  As a sign of the Ray-Ban campaign’s effectiveness, many people who clicked on one of the ads were so pleased with the sale that they then went on to share the offer with all of their Facebook friends and email contacts. Some even changed their profile picture to that of a desaturated photo of Ray-Ban glasses to show that they were happy customers. Ray-Ban definitely deserves its Cannes Lions award for making so many people aware of this incredible limited-time bargain for classic sunglasses in the most popular styles. Here’s hoping other brands copy Ray-Ban’s viral marketing success story and usher in a new golden age of advertising!"

Facebook was founded on the cherished values of maintaining outsize corporate influence and leveraging it for our own personal gain, and articles that go against these values simply have no place on our website.” Wow. It’s great to see a company as powerful and ubiquitous as Facebook take responsibility for the types of articles it’s spreading around the internet. Kudos to Mark Zuckerberg for staying committed to his principles in a time of adversity!"

This List Of Kids Holding Up Signs Saying That StarKist Tuna Gives Them The Energy They Need To Bully Their Classmates Will Only Come Down If StarKist Pays Us $90 Million,N/A,https://clickhole.com/this-list-of-kids-holding-up-signs-saying-that-starkist-1826683847/,"Listen up, StarKist, things in the digital media industry have become pretty dire, and unfortunately ClickHole needs to resort to desperate measures to stay afloat. We hate to do this to you, but we’ve got a whole bunch of pictures of kids claiming that your canned tuna gives them the energy they need to bully their classmates, and we won’t take them down unless you pay us $90 million. We wish things could be different, but our site needs to make a profit. Give us $90 million or else these pictures will be on the internet forever. We feel really bad doing this, StarKist, but it’s a brutal time to be in internet publishing, and we have to generate revenue any way we can. Just pay ClickHole the $90 million and this picture will disappear. Work with us here, StarKist. We’d hate for these photos to get spread around the internet and sully your company’s good name. Wire over the 90 mil and this whole thing goes away. The clock is ticking, StarKist. Every second you spend waiting to give ClickHole $90 million, this image calling your canned fish “bully fuel” gets seen by more and more people. We wish it didn’t have to be this way, StarKist, but the harsh realities of our industry have forced us to resort to ugly tactics to stay in the black. Give us $90 million and we’ll take these photos down. We’re sorry. There can be no compromise. Do you think we’re fucking around here, StarKist? Do not test us.

Is that what you want, or would you rather give us $90 million to put an end to this before these images go viral? The choice is yours, StarKist. We hope you make it wisely."
"Company In Crisis: Netflix’s Stock Is Plummeting As More Americans
Discover The Simple Joy Of Ant Farms",N/A,https://clickhole.com/company-in-crisis-netflix-s-stock-is-plummeting-as-mor-1827698329/,"While Netflix has long been hailed as business success, it now seems that the streaming service is in serious financial trouble. Today the company’s stock value plummeted following reports that viewers are giving up television after discovering the simple joy of ant farms. Recent media surveys have found that an increasing number of customers are canceling their subscriptions in favor of the innocent delight that comes from watching a terrarium full of busy worker ants dig tunnels and swarm about. According to analysts, Netflix could be facing hundreds of millions of dollars in lost revenue as more and more Americans realize that watching a community of ants build a tiny city right in your bedroom provides a thrill that not even the most exhilarating moments of Breaking Bad or Orange Is The New Black could ever hope to rival. In order to survive in this shifting media landscape, it seems that Netflix will have to find a way to adjust its business model so that it somehow centers on ant farms, because for the American public, no TV show or movie could possibly be as fascinating as a tiny little civilization of bugs living right in your home. Until Netflix figures out a way to entice consumers away from the mesmerizing joys of the humble ant farm, its stock will continue to free-fall and the company could find itself rendered completely obsolete, just like Blockbuster before it."
Baby Steps: China Has Finally Made It Illegal To Chain A Live Bear At The Front Of Your Driveway And Surgically Attach A Mailbox On Its Head,N/A,https://clickhole.com/baby-steps-china-has-finally-made-it-illegal-to-chain-1826621703/,"Thanks to the tireless work of animal rights groups around the world, the Chinese government has finally made it illegal to chain a live bear at the front of your driveway and attach a mailbox to its head. The cruel practice, which has been illegal in the United States for decades, was long considered acceptable in China, and it was a common practice among the Chinese elite to receive their mail in a mailbox that had been permanently grafted onto the head of a live bear that wandered around their lawn.  However, following a viral social media campaign that depicted people chained to the front of driveways with mailboxes affixed to their heads, public opinion began to shift, and this week Chinese legislators finally bowed to the pressure to take action. From now on, any Chinese citizen who chains up a bear on their front lawn and then surgically attaches a mailbox to that bear’s head will be subject to a heavy fine. There’s still a lot of fighting left to do for animal rights, but this is a step in the right direction. Cheers to the activists that made it happen!"
"Market In Chaos: The Sudden Addition Of 3
Pristine Copies Of ‘Shallow Hal’ To This Thrift Store Has Tanked The Value Of
The Store’s Other 2 Copies Of ‘Shallow Hal’ ",N/A,https://clickhole.com/market-in-chaos-the-sudden-addition-of-3-pristine-copi-1826272729/,"The latest financial news out of Indiana appears to be a catastrophic case of market volatility with devastating repercussions. A Bloomington thrift store’s sudden acquisition of three pristine copies of Shallow Hal on DVD has absolutely tanked the value of the store’s other two copies of Shallow Hal and sent the store’s once-stable Shallow Hal DVD market into a complete tailspin. The market upheaval began around 9 a.m. this morning when three shrink-wrapped DVDs of the high-concept 2001 comedy Shallow Hal were dropped off in the donation bin at Family Value Thrift Store in Bloomington, causing massive price fluctuations to rock the store’s Shallow Hal DVD market. Following an initial valuation of the mint-condition Shallow Hals at $7.99, the market price of the store’s other two copies of the Jack Black-and-Gwyneth Paltrow-helmed romantic comedy plummeted to an abysmal $3.99. Market analysts are attributing the instability of the thrift store’s Shallow Hal market to several key factors, chief among them being that the shrink-wrapped copies of Shallow Hal have clearly never been used, while the store’s other two copies of Shallow Hal both bear signs of wear and tear, including a child’s drawing of a horse on one of the back covers and an unremovable Blockbuster sticker on the other. And the financial forecast appears to indicate that there’s simply no way for these two copies of Shallow Hal that have been for sale at the thrift store for five years to compete with the newly stocked Shallow Hals. This price fluctuation represents unprecedented chaos and uncertainty in a thrift store Shallow Hal DVD market that was viewed by analysts as incredibly stable for so many years. Economists say that it’s doubtful if the store’s Shallow Hal DVD prices will ever stabilize. All we can do is hope that the drastic repricing of these Shallow Hal DVDs does not tank global markets and plunge the world into a second Great Depression."
"Clear Collusion: Upon Meeting, Trump And Putin Immediately Launched Into A 5-Minute Handshake And Chant That Made It Pretty Obvious They Went To The Same Fat Camp Last Year",N/A,https://clickhole.com/clear-collusion-upon-meeting-trump-and-putin-immediat-1827631535/,"In light of Russia’s interference in the 2016 presidential election, President Trump has taken no shortage of flack for his relationship with Vladimir Putin. Now, as the world watches both leaders at their summit in Helsinki, the Russian and U.S. presidents are only exacerbating claims of collusion: Upon meeting, Trump and Putin immediately launched into a five-minute-long handshake and chant that made it fairly obvious they attended the same fat camp last year.  Folks, if there’s a smoking gun connecting Russia and the Trump campaign, this is it. The world watched on in shock this morning as Putin and Trump warmly approached each other at the top of the summit meeting and immediately entered into a spirited secret handshake and chant that all but confirmed that last year both leaders were assigned to the same cabin at Camp Healthy Start, a summer-long weight-loss program in the Berkshires that encourages healthy lifestyle habits through positivity and fun.  As Trump and Putin began a complex series of elbow taps, knee pats, fist daps, and alternating between slapping palms and the backs of their hands, the two world leaders recited cheers they’d memorized with the rest of their cabin, including lines such as “All our pants are down a size / Through fun with friends and exercise! Go! Go! Cabin five!” and “Bye-bye junk food and TV, now it’s basketball and swimming! / When we are active, fit, and eating right, you can’t stop us from winning!”  There’s no way to sugarcoat it: This is pretty damning. Though Trump has aggressively claimed that the investigations into his collusion with the Russian government is nothing but a baseless witch hunt, he appears to have shown the world incontrovertible evidence that he and Putin communicated with each other extensively for the entirety of Camp Healthy Start’s eight-week session last summer. The long handshake and cheer finally came to an end five minutes later as Trump and Putin proudly showed press cameras the blue ribbons they were given on the last day of camp to celebrate hitting their weight-loss goals, with Putin’s ribbon stating an impressive loss of 30 pounds and Trump’s ribbon announcing a respectable loss of 15 pounds.  Wow. You can expect Robert Mueller to subpoena every counselor at Camp Healthy Start any day now. It’ll be pretty difficult for the Trump administration to talk their way out of this one. President Trump will likely continue to deny colluding with Russia to tip the 2016 election in his favor. However, to anyone who’s paying attention to the close bond he formed with Putin as they learned to love and take better care of their bodies at fat camp, it’s all but confirmed. "

British Protesters Flew A Trump Baby Balloon To Symbolize That He Is Full Of Innocent Love And Infinite Curiosity",N/A,https://clickhole.com/take-that-drumpf-british-protesters-flew-a-trump-baby-1827632155/,"During Trump’s trip to England, protesters totally owned him in the most awesome way possible. A giant balloon of Trump as a baby flew over the streets of London to demonstrate that he is full of innocent love and infinite curiosity. Resistance FTW! This baby balloon perfectly captures Drumpf’s affectionate nature and childlike wonder for all things! Can you imagine how furious the Commander in Cheeto was when he saw himself depicted as a human infant—the most fragile and beautiful creature on Earth? Sorry Mr. Trump, you might try to act like a big tough guy, but everyone knows that your inquisitive mind is learning and growing every day. All your wealth and power can’t hide your endless delight in learning about colors and shapes, a joyful discovery that reminds adults who see you at play that life is incredible and full of beauty, and thanks to the balloon the whole world knows it! This balloon no doubt has Trump shaking his tiny fingers, each one perfectly sculpted by God for grasping and touching the exciting new world all around him, in rage! Protest organizers plan to bring the infant balloon to America, so it seems that Agent Orange’s temper tantrum isn’t going to end anytime soon—not until he sleeps soundly in his crib, dreaming sweet dreams about ducks and butterflies. Somebody change the president’s diaper because he’s still so helpless, so small, and so pure."
End Of An Era: Kellogg’s Is Shutting Down Eggo After Its CEO Had A Freaky Dream About Waffles,N/A,https://clickhole.com/end-of-an-era-kellogg-s-is-shutting-down-eggo-after-it-1826796411/,"If you’re a fan of Eggo waffles, you better stock up now while you still can: After 50 years of dominating the frozen waffle market, Kellogg’s announced today that it’s shutting down Eggo because its CEO had a freaky dream about waffles. Whoa. This is major shake-up for the frozen breakfast foods industry. Kellogg’s CEO John Bryant released a statement this morning outlining the spine-chilling dream that convinced him to permanently discontinue the frozen waffle brand, and after hearing all the details, you can’t really blame the guy for pulling the plug. “In my dream I had flesh made of Eggo waffle, and I was lying atop a sizzling waffle iron, feeling excruciating pain as scalding maple syrup was being poured all over me by three faceless, giggling chefs who hovered over me, delighting in my agony,” stated Bryant, adding that all three chefs had giant round bodies like the robot from Big Hero 6 but eerily spoke in the voice of his maternal grandmother, who died many years ago. “While it was an incredibly difficult decision to shut down such an iconic brand, my dream was seriously freaky, and I just don’t have a good feeling about Eggo anymore. Sorry.” Bryant continued to say that the Atlanta production facility where Eggo waffles are produced will be shuttered and demolished immediately, as in his dream he was chased around the factory by a menacing army of 30-foot-tall Eggo waffles with powerful horse thighs, and the thought of ever stepping foot in there again just gives him the willies. Wow. This is officially the end of an era for one of the world’s most beloved frozen-food aisle staples. While this move will undoubtedly have a huge impact on how millions of people eat breakfast every morning, dreams can be incredibly scary, and you have to applaud Bryant for going with his gut and doing what he believed was right after experiencing such a spooky nightmare.

Daring To Dream: Jeff Bezos Is Standing Outside A Guitar Center Gazing Longingly At A $200 Billion Guitar,N/A,https://clickhole.com/daring-to-dream-jeff-bezos-is-standing-outside-a-guita-1826982956/,"Here’s a story about someone who’s not afraid to dream big: Jeff Bezos is standing outside a Guitar Center staring longingly at a $200 billion guitar he wishes he could afford. Keep your eye on the prize, Jeff. Maybe one day! The guitar first caught Bezos’ eye when he was walking by Guitar Center last week, and he’s been by every day since just to check out the same limited-edition Fender Stratocaster with sea-foam green paneling that retails for just shy of $200 billion. Even though the Amazon CEO only has $134 billion in his savings right now, he can’t stop daydreaming about how badass he’d look rocking out to some classic Zeppelin in the 20-car garage of his mansion with that beautiful ax slung around his neck. Now, as Jeff Bezos gazes in wonder at the shiny guitar in the window display, he’s racking his brain to see if there’s anything in his stock portfolio he could sell off to scrape together those last $66 billion he needs to afford the guitar. Wistfully thinking about how romantic his wife, MacKenzie, would think it was if he played her a slow song like Clapton’s “Wonderful Tonight” while sailing on one of their mega-yachts, Bezos is now silently vowing to do whatever it takes—whether setting up new offshore tax shelters, slashing employee benefits, or taking a summer job at a hedge fund—to raise the money needed to bring the $200 billion Strat within his reach. And he’s keenly aware that some other billionaire could swoop in and snatch up the guitar at any moment, so he knows he needs to act fast and save every last penny he earns from here on out to make his dream of owning the gorgeous single-coil Fender a reality. What a beautiful moment! We know Bezos will be pulling out all the stops and working extra hard at his job at Amazon to bring that guitar home. Good luck, sir!"
"Medical Breakthrough: When This Man’s Hulk Hands Were Destroyed In A Car Accident, Doctors Built Him State-Of-The-Art Prosthetic Hulk Hands",N/A,https://clickhole.com/medical-breakthrough-when-this-man-s-hulk-hands-were-d-1826982797/,"Thirty-seven-year-old Steven Valentine feared he might never be the same after suffering a tragic injury, but thanks to a heroic team at Johns Hopkins Hospital, he can live happily for years to come: When Robert lost the use of his Hulk Hands in a devastating car accident, doctors built him brand-new, state-of-the-art prosthetic Hulk Hands.  Simply incredible! This just goes to show the power of modern medicine. While not quite exact replicas of the original promotional foam-rubber Hulk Hands he bought in the wake of 2003’s live-action Hulk film, Valentine’s new prosthetics are nonetheless perfectly serviceable replacements, featuring a similar green color and a sufficiently sturdy construction to withstand all the rigors of playtime. The “HULK SMASH!” sound effect, which sounds more like “HULK SMEEEE-ASHHH!” in the nasally voice of the medical resident who recorded it, will still provide Valentine with roughly the same impact-activated fun he enjoyed before his accident—something that he and his family feared he would lose forever. “After my first Hulk Hands were destroyed in the accident, I thought I would never be able to live the same way again,” said an emotional Valentine, adding that he worried he’d instead have no choice but to settle for a pair of those extendable claw grabbers or perhaps some bloody zombie hands from a seasonal Halloween pop-up store. “My family and I are so thankful for the incredible team of doctors who worked so tirelessly and pushed the boundaries of technology to give me the ability to once again pretend to be the Incredible Hulk. There really is no price you can put on a gift like that.” Though there will undoubtedly be a long adjustment period before Valentine fully adapts to his new oversize novelty fists—as of now, he can only smash them together with about 70 percent of the bone-crunching power as with his previous hands—this truly is a triumph of medical innovation that wouldn’t have been possible even just a few years ago. What an awe-inspiring story! Kudos to the extraordinary team at Johns Hopkins for stepping up in a major way to give Valentine a new lease on life. "
Clash Of Titans: The San Diego Zoo Is Locked In A Tense Legal Dispute With The Louvre Over Who Gets To Keep A Monkey Holding A Van Gogh Painting,N/A,https://clickhole.com/clash-of-titans-the-san-diego-zoo-is-locked-in-a-tense-1827446269/,"A thorny ownership dispute is playing out between two major institutions that could very well end up becoming one of the defining legal battles of our time: The San Diego Zoo is locked in a bitter lawsuit with the Louvre over who gets to keep a monkey holding a van Gogh painting. Wow, this sounds seriously intense! On one hand, the zoo has asserted its claim to the monkey holding the painting, insisting that it is first and foremost an animal. But the Louvre contends that the intrinsic artistic value of the van Gogh must be given precedence, and therefore the monkey holding the painting belongs in the impressionist wing of its museum. The zoo pointed out that the way the monkey waves the painting around over its head makes the painting hard to see, legally rendering it mostly an animal, but the Louvre responded that the movement only increases the dynamism of the piece, further proving its value as a work of art. The respective parties initially tried to settle the case out of court, with the Louvre offering the zoo a very big painting of a cow in exchange for letting the museum keep the monkey holding the van Gogh, and the zoo offering the Louvre some tropical birds with beautiful plumage instead, but so far no offers have been successful in swaying the other side. Both institutions have already shelled out millions to keep litigators working around the clock on the suit, and it seems like things are only going to get more heated. But no matter who comes out on top in the end, this is sure to be a case they’ll be teaching in law schools for generations to come. "

For this reason, I am humbly stepping down from my post.” Wow. This is a bombshell announcement that will surely send shockwaves through all branches of the federal government. It remains to be seen how Democrats will recover from this enormous loss of a crucial left-wing justice, but in the meantime, anyone feeling her absence on the bench can get their RBG fix for $15 at one of her upcoming performances in Annie, which will take place on weekends in September of 2018 as well as at several elementary school assemblies around the D.C. metro area.

Another Failure: Facebook Is Scrambling To Beef Up Security After Discovering Millions Of Users Who Falsely Listed Their Education As ‘School Of Hard Knocks’,N/A,https://clickhole.com/another-failure-facebook-is-scrambling-to-beef-up-secu-1826492891/,"Facebook has had a terrible year, and it looks like things are only getting worse. The social media behemoth just announced that it’s scrambling to beef up security after discovering millions of users who have falsely listed their education as “School of Hard Knocks,” a university that does not seem to exist in any accredited capacity. Yikes. Facebook’s mistakes just keep on coming. Company CEO Mark Zuckerberg revealed today that an internal investigation into the platform’s vulnerabilities identified more than 8 million accounts boasting the fraudulent education bona fides, many of which listed other suspicious personal information including being a “CEO at Self-Employed” and “In a relationship with Netflix.” A staggering 30 percent of these accounts even listed Jesus Christ as their employer and still managed to go undetected until now, raising serious questions about Facebook’s ability to address what appear to be widespread flaws in its security protocol. “While the endgame of these deceptive accounts is still unclear, this suspicious activity has all the hallmarks of a coordinated campaign by a third party to manipulate users and erode trust in the Facebook community,” Zuckerberg wrote in an official blog post. “We’re swiftly making a number of improvements to better detect these ‘School of Hard Knocks’ accounts, as well as similarly deceitful accounts with education credentials like ‘Studied Beer at Party University’ and ‘PhD in Getting Laid.’” Zuckerberg warned that it could take months to weed out these fake accounts, but he listed a number of warning signs users could look for in the meantime, including incorrectly sized profile pictures where the user is posing next to an exotic car they clearly don’t own and frequent posts reporting achievements in Candy Crush Saga. Facebook better get its act together soon, because it’s doubtful users will tolerate these security breaches much longer before abandoning the service for good."
Building On The Past: The Supreme Court Has Upheld President Trump’s Travel Ban By Citing The Robust Legal Precedent Of The United States Acting Like An Amoral Fuckup,N/A,https://clickhole.com/building-on-the-past-the-supreme-court-has-upheld-pres-1827147641/,"The Supreme Court upheld President Trump’s travel ban today, citing its long-held tradition of acting like an amoral fuckup.  “There is a strong legal precedent in this court to callously validate unjust and discriminatory laws for the convenience of those in power, and with that in mind, we have ruled in favor of the Trump administration’s proposed travel ban,” wrote Chief Justice John G. Roberts in the majority opinion. “We cite here myriad cases throughout American history when this court has just absolutely fucking miffed it when it came to obvious ethical decisions, per such rulings as Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537 (1896), in which this court ruled to legalize racial segregation, and Buck v. Bell, 274 U.S. 200 (1927), in which this court declared it permissible to forcibly sterilize intellectually disabled Americans. Our decision today to uphold a law that unambiguously discriminates against an entire group of people is based upon this robust legal precedent of the Supreme Court allowing this country to govern itself in an abhorrent manner.” Wow. SCOTUS’ decision today to permit the Trump administration’s travel ban is definitely going to be polarizing, but whether or not you agree with it, you have to admit that it’s given its decision a lot of consideration and presented a careful argument based on past court precedent. At the end of the day, the system still works!"

Born before World World I, O’Connor lived to the age of 107, which turned out to be pretty goddamn pointless because she died anyway. Damn. What a huge fucking waste of time. O’Connor attributed her long life to going on daily walks around her neighborhood, even though going on all those walks makes no sense if she was just going to go ahead and kick the bucket anyway. She might as well have just peaced out at a normal age because everything’s pretty much the same with her as it was 20 years ago. A funeral service will be held for O’Connor this weekend, and no doubt it will be attended by friends and family members confused about why she bothered to live past 100 just to throw the whole thing out the window by croaking regardless. She didn’t even bother living to a nice round number like 110. Honestly, whatever."
Heartbreaking: This Economist Broke Down In Tears On CNN After Seeing A Line Graph Depicting The Economic Impact Of Locking Migrant Families In Detention Centers,N/A,https://clickhole.com/heartbreaking-this-economist-broke-down-in-tears-on-cn-1827111196/,"In an incredibly emotional moment, Princeton professor of economics Calvin Ableson went on CNN last night and broke down while explaining a graph that depicted the negative economic impact of removing migrant families from their homes and communities and locking them in state-run detention facilities.  “I will never forget the moment I saw this graph and it hit me that what we’re doing to these migrant families by taking them out of their communities and imprisoning them indefinitely—it has a measurable effect on our economy,” Ableson explained through tears on Anderson Cooper’s show last evening, gesturing to the graphic that laid out the loss of funds the U.S. government would see as a result of its current anti-immigration efforts. “This harrowing data set will be ingrained into my mind forever. Between the federal money we’ll spend prosecuting and deporting the migrant families, the drain their deportation will have on our country’s labor market, and the sheer cost of providing even the lowest-tier housing, food, and medical care to the families we’ve imprisoned, the way we treat migrants at the border creates a financial drain and misappropriation of resources that I can’t think about without getting choked up.” Ableson ended his heartbreaking segment with an impassioned plea to the federal government, saying, “I call on the Trump administration to put down its anti-immigration torches and pitchforks, and end this horrifying, unconscionable misappropriation of resources.” Whether the government listens remains to be seen, but Americans will surely not soon forget the stark image of Ableson’s graph and the devastating loss of money that it symbolizes."
ATTACK ON FREEDOM: HATE-MONGERING HILLARYITES Just Shooed Stephen Miller Away From The Bird Feeder Where He Was PEACEFULLY ENJOYING BREAKFAST,N/A,https://clickhole.com/attack-on-freedom-hate-mongering-hillaryites-just-shoo-1827107233/,"Patriots, our liberty is being threatened by DISRESPECTFUL DEMS. Stephen Miller was CALMLY eating his breakfast of seeds and cracked corn out of a PUBLIC bird feeder this morning when RUDE liberals with NO MANNERS approached him and drove him away with a broom. Make no mistake, patriots: This is a slippery slope. We are descending into a shameless society with NO SENSE OF DECORUM where people are being IMPOLITE to government officials quietly lapping up sugar water at a bird feeder just because they have DIFFERENT OPINIONS about whether or not MIGRANT children should be TREATED WITH DIGNITY. CRUDE DEMS think that just because they DISAGREE with Stephen Miller’s STRONG policies about PUTTING IMMIGRANTS IN PRISONS that they can barge into his PRIVATE BIRD FEEDER LIFE and stop him from nibbling on NUTRITIOUS millet. This is yet another example of LOW LIFE liberals lacking any semblance of DECENCY or CIVILITY, and we can guarantee that the HYPOCRITE LYING MEDIA won’t be covering the DEPRAVED DISCRIMINATION that Stephen Miller experienced while attempting to CHOW DOWN on LOVELY GRAIN at a bird feeder. It has never been clearer: We need to PROTECT OUR FREEDOMS AND BIRD FEEDERS from the DISGUSTING LEFT!"
"Roadmap To Peace: Necco Has Set Aside A Roll Of Wafers For Israel And Palestine To Share Only After They
Achieve A Two-State Solution",N/A,https://clickhole.com/roadmap-to-peace-necco-has-set-aside-a-roll-of-wafers-1826271693/,"With violence flaring up in the Middle East, peace between Israelis and Palestinians seems like a more distant goal than ever. Fortunately a new diplomatic player has entered the fray and seems determined to bring these two warring factions together. Candy company Necco announced that it has set aside a roll of Necco Wafers for Israel and Palestine to share, but only after they achieve a two-state solution. Necco is playing hardball here, because it’s made clear that not a single chalky, sweet wafer is up for grabs until a peace treaty is signed.  “If the people of Israel and Palestine want to get their hands on this roll of delicious Necco Wafers, they must first stop the horrific cycle of bloodshed that has brought destruction and misery to their region for decades,” the CEO of Necco Wafers, Michael McGee, said in an impassioned speech at the United Nations today. “We call on the leaders of Israel, Fatah, and Hamas to set aside their differences, because the sooner you agree on a two-state compromise, the sooner you’ll get a complimentary roll of Necco Wafers to share.” After unveiling its bold peace plan, Necco mailed the roll of wafers to neutral U.N. observers in Geneva, Switzerland, where it will remain under armed guard until Israelis and Palestinians reach a lasting peace accord, at which point the waxy paper containing the Necco Wafers will be split open and Israeli and Palestinian leaders will divide candy amongst all their citizens. Unfortunately, negotiations are off to a rocky start as both the Israelis and the Palestinians have simultaneously declared they are the rightful owners of the entire roll of Necco Wafers and have no intention of sharing. Let’s hope they can work past their conflict and reach a peaceful accord, because otherwise those discs of sugar will never be eaten in the Holy Land."
Market Frenzy: Apple Stocks Have Skyrocketed After News Broke That The Business Pig Was Walking Around The Company’s Office,N/A,https://clickhole.com/market-frenzy-apple-stocks-have-skyrocketed-after-news-1825887893/,"If you’re an investor with holdings in Apple you’ve got to be jumping up and down with joy at today’s unprecedented market activity: Apple stocks skyrocketed today after news broke that the business pig was walking around the company’s office. Incredible. The business pig’s visit is a strong signal to investors that Apple’s financial footing is more solid than ever. After opening the day at 185.11, shares of AAPL quickly shot up to over 450 by noon Eastern Standard Time when investors caught wind that the business pig had walked into Apple headquarters and was sniffing out a trash bin just outside CEO Tim Cook’s office. By the time the business pig had trotted over to the tech company’s cafeteria in his waistcoat and bow tie and started squealing at employees for a few spare lunch scraps, Apple had already experienced its largest single-day gain in company history. Prices did experience some volatility later in the day when it was reported that the business pig had thrown up, as investors took this as a possible sign of trepidation by the business pig, but they rebounded when the pig then ate the vomit. The business pig gracing the Apple offices with its presence shot investor confidence sky-high, resulting in a more than 300 percent surge in stock prices. All in all, AAPL prices topped out at 595.91 midday when sources reported that the business pig was dashing around the Apple offices on a sugar high from a discarded muffin it found in the trash, but they had leveled off at 570.20 by market closing when it trotted back outside onto the company campus and started licking a ketchup stain on the sidewalk. Needless to say, Apple investors are hoping for another showing of the business pig tomorrow but will have to wait and see if it’s impressed enough by Apple’s market performance to make its way back into the building from out in the campus flowerbeds where it’s currently rolling around in the dirt.

Science FTW: Researchers Covered Head To Toe In Mustard Have Announced That Their Colleagues Got Them Good,N/A,https://clickhole.com/science-ftw-researchers-covered-head-to-toe-in-mustard-1826308867/,"Anyone who keeps up with the science world is going to want to take some time to read about this fascinating new development: Stanford researchers covered head to toe in mustard have announced that their colleagues got them good. Wow! What an exciting revelation, straight from some of the best scientific minds in the country. The epigenetics researchers soaked in bright yellow Heinz mustard held a press conference this morning to announce that they’d been had. “After thorough analysis, we have come to the conclusion that our friends in the bioengineering department really pulled one over on us,” said lead researcher Shannon Padgett. “Our hypothesis stated that after we got them good last week, there was no way we would ever get our comeuppance—but as of this morning, experiential evidence has proven that hypothesis false.” “Needless to say, the implications as far as how we could potentially get them back are numerous,” Padgett added, taking off one of her shoes and shaking several ounces of mustard out of it. “What’s most exciting for us as researchers is that this isn’t over.” Well, science nerds all over the world are no doubt going to be following this news with rapt attention. We can’t wait to find out whether these incredible researchers manage another caper—or whether their colleagues will get the last laugh."
"Heartwarming: These Students Raised $10,000 For Their Teacher When He Asked Them Nicely ",N/A,https://clickhole.com/heartwarming-these-students-raised-10-000-for-their-t-1826983438/,"A special group of kids at Lincoln Middle School in Bloomfield, MI just did one of the most heartwarming things of all time. The incredible students came together and worked tirelessly to raise $10,000 for their teacher when he nicely asked them if they could please do that. When seventh-grade math teacher James McConnell stood up in front of his class and kindly asked his students to go get him $10,000, they immediately sprang into action. The kids began fundraising right away, working tirelessly for months to collect the money for Mr. McConnell by holding bake sales, staging a city-wide walkathon, and crowdfunding through a GoFundMe page titled “Help Us Give Mr. McConnell 10k To Spend On Whatever.” It’s truly inspiring to see such big-hearted kids doing what it takes to help a man with good manners get more money! “We knew right away that we couldn’t sit by and watch one of our teachers ask very nicely for a lot more money and not do anything,” said Kayla Collins, a student in Mr. McConnell’s class. “He asked for $10,000 so politely, and we knew we had to do whatever it takes to get him that money so that he could have it in his bank account and use it to buy lots of nice things for himself.” The hard work of Kayla and her classmates finally paid off when they got to present their teacher a $10,000 check and watch as he tearfully thanked them for giving him the large sum of cash he had asked so politely for. Watching the look on Mr. McConnell’s face when he realized he had a lot more money was a truly moving and inspiring moment and proof that these students had accomplished something special. Absolutely beautiful. A story like this just goes to show how powerful a school community can be when everyone sees that one of their own would like to have a bunch more money all at once, and collectively decides to lend a helping hand. Kids FTW!"
Taking A Stand: ‘The New York Times’ Editorial Board Has Announced That George H.W. Bush Shouldn’t Do Too Many Other Things Because It Is Done Editing His Obituary,N/A,https://clickhole.com/taking-a-stand-the-new-york-times-editorial-board-ha-1826385797/,"In a shocking and strongly worded statement published on its front page this morning, The New York Times Editorial Board has issued a public request to George H.W. Bush demanding that he not do too many other things during his lifetime because it is done editing his obituary. “Mr. President, The New York Times is all done writing your obituary, and therefore we strongly urge you to refrain from doing anything else that would need to be included in an obituary summarizing your life, including taking up any new hobbies, achieving anything notable, or committing any significant crimes,” the board wrote in an impassioned editorial titled “George H.W. Bush, Please Don’t Do Anything Else.” “As it stands, the summary of your life we plan to publish upon your death is already at 5,000 words, and we simply cannot make it longer, so please do not do anything that would require us to add something, or else we will need to spend hours revising and reformatting our work.” Over the course of their message to George H.W. Bush, the Times editorial board goes on to inform the former president that if he does do anything that merits inclusion in his obituary, such as writing a children’s book or developing an interest in archery, it will be forced to cut other biographical information out of his Times obituary, like descriptions of his family or his service in the United States Navy. In the statement’s final lines, the board urges Bush to “just sit still until you pass away so that we don’t have to mess with the moving, eloquent memorial we’ve already written about you.” Speaking with such forceful language to a former U.S. president is definitely a bold move from the paper of record. Here’s hoping that George H.W. Bush takes The New York Times’ demands to heart so that its writers don’t have to do any more work!"

"‘Golf Questions Only, Please’: A Frustrated Tiger Woods Just Stormed Out Of A Press Conference After Reporters Only Wanted To Talk About His Beautiful Homemade Ketchup-Packet Gown",N/A,https://clickhole.com/golf-questions-only-please-a-frustrated-tiger-woods-1826982864/,"Hoo boy, well, this was awkward. There was a bit of drama today at a press conference when former World Number One golfer Tiger Woods lost his cool and ended up dropping some F-bombs and storming off after reporters wouldn’t stop bombarding him with questions about the gorgeous handmade ketchup-packet gown he was wearing. Damn. Tiger does not seem too happy. The breathtaking fitted-bodice A-line gown, which Woods meticulously constructed over hundreds of hours out of ketchup packets he stole from Wendy’s, was clearly an object of fascination for reporters, who immediately strayed from asking questions about the 11-time PGA Player of the Year’s golf game and began probing for more details about the one-of-a-kind garment. Tiger’s attempts to steer the conversation back to golf failed miserably, and he quickly lost his cool. “Jesus fucking Christ, are you seriously asking me—at a press conference about golf, of all places—to explain the technology I created to keep the ketchup packets from bursting when I sit down?” yelled an exasperated Woods, looking beyond elegant in the perfectly tailored gown as he went on to angrily describe the proprietary adhesive he coated the packets with to prevent punctures. “Seriously, this is fucking amateur hour right now. How can you call yourselves professional journalists and yet apparently have zero fucking interest in covering what you’re supposed to cover? I’m a golfer, and I’m here to talk about golf! Who fucking cares what I’m wearing?” Woods then furiously knocked aside the microphone and marched off the stage, allowing reporters to glimpse another angle of the dress’ mesmerizing silhouette. In the hours since the incident, footage of Woods’ meltdown has been playing pretty much on loop on ESPN and the Golf Channel, and the internet is having an absolute field day. Remix videos of the four-time Masters winner screaming “This press conference has nothing to do with my stunning ketchup-packet evening gown or the striking way it complements my figure—this is about golf, you goddamn morons!” have been quickly racking up millions of views, and the hashtag #golfquestionsonly is now trending globally on social media. Yikes. Tiger probably should’ve realized that if you’re going to wear a dress that lovely to a press conference, it’s definitely going to attract some attention. Lucky for him, though, the unparalleled beauty of his ketchup-packet gown will almost certainly linger in the public’s memory far longer than the tantrum it provoked. "
Exonerated: This Convicted Murderer Was Released From Prison After 20 Years When An Online Quiz Sorted Him Into Gryffindor,N/A,https://clickhole.com/exonerated-this-convicted-murderer-was-released-from-p-1826377091/,"When Walter Anderson was convicted of murdering a convenience store clerk two decades ago, it seemed like he would be in prison for the rest of his life. However, an incredible nonprofit pressured the courts to revisit Walter’s case, and thanks to new forensic tools, he received some incredible news: After spending 20 years in prison as a convicted murderer, Walter Anderson was released after an online quiz sorted him into Gryffindor. Walter had been maintaining his innocence for two decades after his conviction in the murder of a convenience store clerk, but he had little legal recourse before a nonprofit advocated for him to take an internet sorting hat quiz. When his results proved that he had the noble virtues and deep moral compass of a Gryffindor, a judge declared him innocent and ordered him to be immediately released from the Louisburg Federal Penitentiary. “Gryffindor is the home of the best and bravest of the wizarding world, and the fact that Mr. Anderson was assigned to this house by an online quiz makes it clear that he couldn’t possibly have committed an act as terrible as murder,” said Judge Sonia Sandhu, announcing her decision to overturn Walter’s guilty verdict from 1998. “If the jury had been aware during the trial that Mr. Anderson was kindhearted and courageous enough to be sorted into the same house as inspiring heroes like Hermione Granger, Sirius Black, and Harry Potter himself, he would never have been put behind bars.” In light of Walter’s overdo exoneration, criminal investigators have re-opened their search for the killer with a focus on individuals who have been sorted into Slytherin, though they have noted that there is also a remote chance that someone with the raw intelligence of a Ravenclaw could be responsible for committing the crime and avoiding capture. Although America’s criminal justice system remains flawed, Walter’s story is a ray of hope that we’re making strides to ensure that no righteous and loyal Gryffindors are ever put behind bars again. Here’s hoping that online sorting hat quizzes will help make our country a more just and humane society!"
Taking Action: Legislators Have Introduced A Bipartisan Bill Demanding That The Trump Administration Make Its Inhumane Immigration Policies Easier To Ignore,N/A,https://clickhole.com/taking-action-legislators-have-introduced-a-bipartisan-1826924314/,"You spoke, and your national representatives have listened: In response to public outcry against the separation of migrant families at the border, Congress has introduced a bill with wide bipartisan support demanding that President Trump employ unspeakably cruel immigration policies that are easier for people to ignore. The legislation supported by Democratic and Republican leadership calls for the Trump administration to immediately alter its immigration policies that blatantly parade human tragedy in the open so that mistreating immigrants is once again able to fly under the average citizen’s radar, as it did in the Bush and Obama administrations. The bill openly condemns the way Trump’s border policies have led to heartbreaking images that are impossible to scrub from your mind, like an immigrant mother being separated from her breastfeeding child, and strongly asserts that assembly-line trials and indefinite detention of unaccompanied minors as examples of the kind of blatant disregard for due process that is way simpler for everyone to overlook. “The American people are good, decent, moral people, and they’d much rather be able to pretend that the brutal treatment of immigrants along our Southern border isn’t happening,” stated Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell, standing side by side with minority leader Chuck Schumer. “We can still detain asylum-seeking mothers and children in order to deter others from coming to the U.S. border without having concentration camps full of kids all over the news for people to have to see, and that’s what this legislation will accomplish.” Wow. After months of gridlock on an immigration bill in Congress, both parties have finally agreed on failing migrant children using a complicated and ineffective bureaucracy that will be much easier for American citizens to turn a blind eye to than literal cages full of children in the desert. It took a while, but it looks like Congress is finally doing its job. "
Ominous: The USDA Has Printed Gene Hackman’s Nutritional Information On His Forehead,N/A,https://clickhole.com/ominous-the-usda-has-printed-gene-hackman-s-nutritiona-1826377149/,"In a deeply ominous development earlier today, the U.S. Department of Agriculture made the official decision to print Gene Hackman’s nutritional information on his forehead. Gene Hackman was spotted outside his Santa Fe home with his full caloric information printed clearly and prominently directly above his eyebrows. Hackman reportedly contains 80,000 calories and a balanced set of vitamins and minerals, which has now been eerily broadcast by the agency responsible for regulating the diets of every American. “We at the USDA would like all Americans to consider the fact that movie star Gene Hackman contains 18 grams of protein per serving, and that protein is an essential nutrient for anyone’s diet. Thank you,” said Dr. Elise Bachman, a lead regulator at the USDA, during a sinister press conference in which Mr. Hackman was described multiple times as “more nutritious than fruit.” “Also, please keep in mind that Gene Hackman is currently ripe and in full bloom, and he’ll never be more delicious than he is right at this moment. If you wait too long, Gene Hackman won’t taste as good. No more questions.” Yikes. It’s a real shame that the USDA has decided to classify Gene Hackman as such an important part of a balanced diet. Best of luck, Gene. Things are definitely not looking good for you."
Major Scandal: Madame Tussauds Has Been Forced To Melt Down Tom Hanks’ Wax Sculpture After It Bit A Child ,N/A,https://clickhole.com/major-scandal-madame-tussauds-has-been-forced-to-melt-1826385845/,"Visitors at Madame Tussauds’ Orlando location were shocked and saddened by the events that unfolded earlier today, as the wax museum became the focus of a troubling controversy: In a painstakingly difficult yet necessary decision, Madame Tussauds was forced to melt down Tom Hanks’ wax sculpture after it bit a child. This is truly a shame, and terrible for all parties involved. What began as a normal day at the museum turned tragic in the blink of an eye, when a 9-year-old boy who was admiring a wax sculpture of Zac Efron was bitten on the forearm by the Forrest Gump star’s popular wax likeness that was being exhibit nearby. In response, security immediately grabbed the tuxedo-wearing mold of Tom Hanks and removed it from the floor before any other patrons were harmed, though thankfully the kid’s arm was left mostly unscathed due to the teeth being made of soft and malleable wax. To ensure the safety of all customers going forward, just minutes later the effigy was taken into the basement where it was placed into a furnace and euthanized by being melted into a waxy puddle. There’s no denying that Tom Hanks was one of the more beloved wax statues in Madame Tussauds’ collection, which makes its violent outburst all the more heartbreaking—especially considering it was known for having a docile and often motionless demeanor. While museumgoers struggled to explain what might have caused the attack, they were all in agreement that the child’s life was of foremost importance, though many were still devastated that they would no longer be able to take selfies with one of the more realistic Tom Hanks representations ever created. “Tom Hanks was an integral part of our wax museum and brought immeasurable joy to many over the years, but once he began to act aggressively, we had no option but to utilize one of the furnaces that we had installed for this very reason,” said curator Benjamin Davis as he defended the staff’s actions during a recent press conference. “Safety is our No. 1 priority, and we apologize to anyone who was affected by this loss, as well as anyone in the museum who was subjected to hearing the statue’s screams resonate through the floorboards while it slowly melted.” How horrible. You hate to see a situation unravel like this, though at least we can take solace in knowing the boy is okay. In addition, Madame Tussauds has offered up a touching tribute to Tom Hanks by creating a memorial candle from the former sculpture’s wax, so hopefully people can look back on the statue’s life fondly instead of focusing on how it acted in its final moments. Here’s hoping that it’s not too long before all those impacted are able to recover."

NASA Has Announced There Will Be An Ultra-Rare Spalding Eclipse Next Week Where The Sun Passes Directly Behind The Basketball Wedged In The Tree Outside This Boy’s Window,N/A,https://clickhole.com/nasa-has-announced-there-will-be-an-ultra-rare-spalding-1825999688/,"Any aspiring stargazers out there are going to want to take note, because an amazing astronomical phenomenon will be on display very soon: According to NASA, next Sunday there will be an incredibly rare “Spalding Eclipse,” in which the sun passes directly behind the basketball wedged in the tree outside this boy’s house. Amazing. The universe is so beautiful. The eclipse, which will be visible to everyone in 13-year-old Dylan Lawson’s backyard, is set to take place at 2:55 p.m., when the sun’s path will completely align with the basketball that got stuck in the upper branches of the big tree behind Dylan’s house three years ago following a bungled jump shot that sailed right over the backboard of the basketball hoop in his driveway.  According to NASA, the Spalding Eclipse was first observed three years ago, when Dylan’s friend Brandon interrupted their all-day FIFA marathon to point out how the sun had gone completely behind the basketball. The event happens very rarely, and astronomers say that the best place to view the stunning moment when the sun passes behind the basketball is in Dylan’s yard directly next to the swing set. Astronomers say that the sun will be completely obscured by the basketball for only a few minutes, so you’ll have a pretty small window of time to witness this stunning phenomenon. And once the Spalding Eclipse is over, it won’t happen again for another 125 years, provided that Dylan’s dad doesn’t pull the big ladder out of the garage and finally take it down like he’s been threatening to do for months. So if you can, be sure to get to Dylan’s yard tonight to witness the moment that the sun disappears behind the basketball in Dylan’s tree. The Spalding Eclipse is sure to be a breathtaking spectacle, and this might be your only chance to see it!"
Time To Panic: Aiden Did His Book Report Super Fast And Now One Of Us Has To Go Before Class Ends,N/A,https://clickhole.com/time-to-panic-aiden-did-his-book-report-super-fast-and-1826121942/,"It’s officially time to freak out, because Aiden just seriously boned our entire English class: He did his book report super fast, and now one of us has to go before class ends. Shit. The class rubric said that the book reports were supposed to be at least five minutes long, so who knows what was going through Aiden’s head when he breezed through his in 30 seconds, but now there’s enough time left in the period that someone else definitely has to present. Mrs. Schrader already asked if there were any volunteers who wanted to go, but all the overachieving kids already went at the beginning, so for sure no one is going to raise their hand right now. It’s only a matter of time before she just picks someone at random.  Everyone was 100 percent banking on going tomorrow. Does Aiden even know how badly he just screwed us over? Erica was smart enough to grab the hall pass right away and go to the bathroom before Mrs. Schrader called on someone, but the rest of us are freaking out. Everyone’s frantically going through their folders, because we’re supposed to only look at our notes a few times while we’re up there and there’s no way most people even have their theme statements memorized. Honestly, some people probably aren’t even done with their books yet, and now someone has to present on the fly. What was Aiden thinking? He was doing a report on The Hobbit, which is, like, 400 pages long. How did he only milk two index cards out of it? Even if he only read the SparkNotes, he could have given some quick background on the main characters and not left us out to dry. We thought he’d at least pad out the time by asking the class for questions, which we totally would have gone along with. But nope, he just mumbled for a bit then said, “In conclusion, the wizard doesn’t die,” and that was it, with a full seven minutes left of class. He didn’t even say who the author was.  Every kid in class is panicking, except for the kiss-asses who already went and are gleefully watching the rest of us squirm. Whoever has to present is definitely going to take a major hit on this 50-point grade, and right at the end of the year, too.  Thanks, Aiden. You really fucked us over on this one. "
"Heartwarming: When This 25-Year-Old Resistance Member Was Dying Of Cancer, Robert Mueller Came To His Hospital Room To Give Him A Sneak Peek At The Conclusion Of The Russia Investigation",N/A,https://clickhole.com/heartwarming-when-this-25-year-old-resistance-member-w-1826811951/,"Make sure you have some tissues nearby, #Resistance Nation. This is bound to give you a happy sniffle or two. It’s been a rough year for Michael Statlender. Besides living in a nation where an orange tyrant sits in the White House, this poor #Resistance member was diagnosed with terminal cancer at the young age of 25. Fortunately, there are some seriously big-hearted people out there like Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who, after he heard what was happening, made the time to come to Michael’s hospital room to give him a sneak peek at the conclusion of the Russia investigation. Wow, what an amazing thing for Mueller to do. While the rest of us still have to wait a few months to find out exactly what Mueller discovered about President Drumpf’s collusion with Russia, Michael has known the answer since Monday, when Mueller, dressed in one of his iconic two-piece Brooks Brothers suits, paid him a visit in his hospital room and gave him an exciting glimpse at how the whole investigation is going to pan out.  The two sat together for almost two hours as Statlender pored over various documents and the incredibly sweet and patient Mueller answered any questions he had about what ramifications the findings would have for the president and the nation as a whole. Whatever Mueller told Michael about the outcome of the Russia investigation, it was definitely something incredible. Michael could be heard crying, laughing, and gasping in turns for the duration of Mueller’s visit as he revealed every last detail about how his inquiry into the Trump administration will ultimately play out.  At one point Michael could be heard through the closed door of his hospital room shouting, “Oh my god! I thought his political career was over, but he masterminded the whole thing!” A few moments later, the brave cancer patient was also overheard exclaiming, “But if that’s true, then she betrayed the entire Democratic Party!” Sadly, Mueller swore Michael to secrecy, so we won’t know exactly what he was talking about until the conclusion of the Russia investigation is finally released to the public. This is definitely the most heartwarming story we’ve read all day. It’s amazing that Special Counsel Mueller would take time out of his busy schedule to share these exciting secrets with a resistor in need. On behalf of the #Resistance we want to say “thank you” to Robert Mueller for giving Michael such a beautiful gift before he leaves this world. Simply amazing."
Diplomacy Disaster: President Trump Just Sent Out A Series Of Tweets That Makes It Pretty Clear That He’s Under The Impression He Spent The Past Few Days Hanging Out With Chris Farley,N/A,https://clickhole.com/diplomacy-disaster-president-trump-just-sent-out-a-ser-1826802315/,"For anyone who is heralding President Trump’s summit with Kim Jong-un as an historic step toward peace, you might want to hold your horses: Donald Trump just sent out a series of tweets that makes it pretty clear he’s under the impression he spent the past few days hanging out with Chris Farley. Yep, this is not a good look. It seems as though the president mistook Kim Jong-un for a long-deceased comedian known for his classic “fat guy in a little coat” line from the movie Tommy Boy, and seems to be operating under the assumption that he and Farley forged a strong relationship during the course of their visit to Singapore. Take a look at the disastrous string of tweets below: Yikes. Navigating foreign policy with a country as steeped in conflict as North Korea will never be an easy task, and this huge misunderstanding is definitely not going to put us in its good graces. Mr. Trump, this country’s safety is in your hands, so we’re going to need you to step it up next time you meet with a powerful foreign leader."
"Its Biggest Challenge Yet: Netflix Just Announced That Every Episode Of The New ‘Queer Eye’ Season Will Be Dedicated To Making Over One Really, Really Gross Hermit They Found Fucking A Dead Turtle In The Woods",N/A,https://clickhole.com/its-biggest-challenge-yet-netflix-just-announced-that-1826341232/,"The Queer Eye crew has made over some pretty hopeless cases throughout the course of the show, but its next season will far and away be the tallest mountain it’s ever had to summit: Netflix just announced that every episode of the new Queer Eye season will be dedicated to making over one really, really gross hermit they found fucking a dead turtle in the woods.  OMG. The Fab Five totally have their work cut out for them this time around!  Coming June 15, the new batch of Queer Eye episodes promises to deliver the same transformative storylines fans know and love, except instead of helping someone new each week, the boys will spend an entire month on one filthy hermit named only Forest Ed, who is sexually fixated on a turtle corpse and speaks only in quotes from the movie Homeward Bound. After 13 hour-long episodes, straight guy Forest Ed will emerge from the Atlanta backwoods and debut his new look behind a local Chipotle, where the employees who routinely chase him from rooting through the dumpster by throwing stones at him and yelling, “Be gone, turtle fucker!” will hopefully be totally wowed by his new look. “When fans first meet Forest Ed, they really won’t be sure whether they are looking at a person dry-humping a turtle or just a vibrating pile of dirty hair,” the announcement teased. “But Jonathan, Tan, Karamo, Antoni, and Bobby truly pull off something incredible by transforming this turtle necrophiliac who moans longingly whenever he leaves the woods into someone who could more or less pass as a human man.” So. Awesome. With a rancid sexual-deviant nomad thrown into the mix, it sounds like this season of Queer Eye is going to be better than ever. Luckily, there’s only a few more weeks before the new season officially drops—we can’t wait to see if the Fab Five can get him to pry that desiccated turtle husk off his genitals!"
Confronting The Past: EA Just Spent Its Entire E3 Presentation Apologizing For Putting Antoine Walker On The Cover Of ‘NBA Live 99’,N/A,https://clickhole.com/confronting-the-past-ea-just-spent-its-entire-e3-prese-1826804007/,"Most video game developers use their massive platform at E3 to make announcements about future releases, but one brave company at the expo decided to take some time to atone for its past: EA Sports just spent the entirety of its E3 presentation apologizing for putting Antoine Walker on the cover of NBA Live 99. Speaking before a packed house of fans, media, and industry heavyweights, EA CEO Andrew Wilson spent over half an hour this morning expressing his “deep and profound” regret over his company’s decision to choose an unproven, generally unliked third-year player on a last-place team as the cover athlete for the 1999 installment of its NBA Live series. He claimed that the company had grossly overestimated the Boston Celtic forward’s star power and marketability at the time, not realizing that his legacy would eventually be defined by abysmal shot selection, terrible financial decisions, and poor fitness. “Twenty years later, it is clear to us that Antoine Walker is not the once-in-a-generation talent we perceived him to be, and we understand now that he had no business being on the cover of a popular video game,” said Wilson in an address he delivered to a massive crowd of gaming fans. “In retrospect, we should’ve gone with one of the many Hall of Fame–caliber players who were active in the league at the time, such as Kobe Bryant, Shaq, Tim Duncan, Kevin Garnett, Dikembe Mutombo, Karl Malone, or Grant Hill. They were all way better choices for the cover than Antoine fucking Walker, and it’s weird we didn’t pick one of them.” “Honestly, Antoine Walker wasn’t even the best option on the Celtics,” he continued. “Paul Pierce would’ve made much more sense for NBA Live 99. We at EA really screwed the pooch on that one.” Absolutely beautiful. It’s incredibly encouraging to see a company owning up to its missteps, and here’s hoping it will encourage other game developers to take accountability for their actions in the future. "
Something Fucked-Up Must Have Happened: Every Suspect In This Police Lineup Is A Little Boy In A Sailor Suit Licking A Big Lollipop,N/A,https://clickhole.com/something-fucked-up-must-have-happened-every-suspect-i-1826382716/,"Oh shit. You better buckle the fuck up for this one. Something truly fucked-up must have just happened, because every suspect in this lineup is a little boy in a sailor suit licking a big lollipop. Seriously, fuck right off with this. Something truly sinister must have just happened if the only suspects are these creepy little fancy boys. Whether the heinous crime in question was committed by a demented 8-year-old who chopped a bunch of people up or by an actual demon manifested in the form of a little boy is still unclear, but honestly, it’s probably better not to know. Whatever happened must have had a shitload of victims, because there’s been a whole damn line of witnesses coming through to look at these lolli-licking sailor boys and all of them have the hollow eyes and shell-shocked expression of someone who’s just been in a war zone. Oh, for fuck’s sake. The police have been asking the boys in the lineup to step forward and say the phrase “Are you my mommy?” in a low, guttural voice, so it’s likely that these poor victims probably heard a little boy in a sailor suit say those words in the voice of an adult man right before that creepy little bastard committed whatever his unspeakable crime was. Just when it seemed like things couldn’t get any worse, one of the cops just wheeled in a burn victim covered in bandages from head to toe on a gurney. The cops then started to play a recording of carnival music to “help bring the victim back to the scene of the crime,” which probably means fire or some sort of acid and carnival music were somehow involved as well. Fuck. Even the detectives seem to be having a hard time handling whatever grisly trauma one of these little sailor boys just caused. One of the investigators keeps looking through some folders spread out on a table, and whatever he saw in there made him throw up into a wastepaper basket twice. Another officer made eye contact with one of the little boys and ran screaming from the room while the boy stared straight ahead and quietly licked his lollipop.  We’re sure that more details are forthcoming, but, quite frankly, we’re not interested in finding out what they are. We’re done with this fucking horror show. Jesus Christ."
Master Dealmaker: Donald Trump Negotiated With Kim Jong-Un To End The U.S.’s Nuclear Weapons Program In Exchange For Reduced Sanctions On North Korea  ,N/A,https://clickhole.com/master-dealmaker-donald-trump-negotiated-with-kim-jong-1826741216/,"It seems as if Donald Trump’s brash, unpredictable approach to foreign diplomacy is finally paying off in a big way, as the president just successfully reached a deal with Kim Jong-un to end the U.S.’s nuclear weapons program in exchange for reduced sanctions on North Korea. After a marathon closed-door meeting Tuesday, a smiling Trump emerged with news that he had struck a landmark deal with his long-time adversary, the terms of which require the U.S. to provide billions of dollars in annual economic aid and sanctions relief to North Korea under the condition that the U.S. carry out a complete and irreversible dismantlement of the American nuclear weapons program.  According to reports, the typically recalcitrant Mr. Kim was reluctant to agree to President Trump’s terms, but ultimately relented after Trump demanded that the North Korean government also accept a gift of 500 tanks from the United States military. “Following months of tough talk and escalating threats, Kim Jong-un immediately folded under the pressure of President Trump’s masterful negotiation tactics and has conceded to allow the total denuclearization of the United States,” stated an official White House press release. “Thanks to President Trump’s bold, forceful dealmaking, we will soon be living in a world where a denuclearized America is sending constant gifts and financial aid to North Korea.” Wow. While many have been skeptical about Trump’s ability to resolve international conflicts, the president deserves major credit for securing this agreement and moving the U.S. toward a more peaceful future. It looks like President Trump truly is the greatest negotiator alive!"
"Clearing Things Up: The Catholic Church Has Announced That Priests Don’t Have To Live Together, They Just Do That Because It’s Fun",N/A,https://clickhole.com/clearing-things-up-the-catholic-church-has-announced-t-1825666068/,"Catholics everywhere received an important religious message this morning when the Catholic Church issued an official statement clarifying that priests don’t have to live together, they just do that because it’s fun. Pope Francis stated in a public address that even though many members of the clergy live together in rectories all over the world, there’s no Church doctrine requiring them to do so, and that any ordained priests who do live together do so of their own free will. The Pope went on to explain that priests often prefer living together because they all have so many common interests, such as God and going to church. His Holiness pointed out that many priests opt to live together in rectories because it’s similar to having a big sleepover with your friends every night, but emphasized that these priests would face no penalties from the Church if they wanted to move out and get their own place. Hopefully, anyone who was operating under the misconception that priests all live together in a house because the Catholic Church requires them to has now had their confusion cleared up. It’s great to know the Catholic Church is willing to be so transparent with its parishioners, and also that its priests are having fun living together. Hats off to the Pope for this one!"
Resistance Setback: It’s Clear From Robert Mueller’s Investigation That He Thinks Donald Trump And Donald Drumpf Are Two Separate People,N/A,https://clickhole.com/resistance-setback-it-s-clear-from-robert-mueller-s-in-1826548022/,"Terrible news, members of the #Resistance: Robert Mueller’s latest moves imply that he thinks Donald Trump and Donald Drumpf are two separate people. A source with direct knowledge of the investigation revealed that Mueller plans to issue a subpoena for “Donald Drumpf” because after reading numerous articles, he suspects that someone named Drumpf may have been a key Trump agent in securing anti-Hillary opposition research from Russian hackers. Mueller apparently considers Drumpf to be a key player in the investigation due to what he believes is mounting evidence of Drumpf’s extremely friendly—perhaps even romantic—relationship with Vladimir Putin, and in a major facepalm for the #Resistance, he reportedly assigned a dozen investigators to focus only on Drumpf. Making matters worse, the special counsel has reportedly begun seeking a third person he thinks is named Donald Dump, a mysterious actor who Mueller has concluded is known to some associates only by the code name “President Cheeto.” While many liberal-leaning Americans have hung their hopes of getting rid of President Trump on Mueller’s far-ranging inquiry into Russian collusion, the fact that the special counsel ordered a raid on Drumpf’s alleged home, the Kremlin, to gather evidence that Drumpf urinated on prostitutes and funneled Russian oligarch money through a construction project has certainly deflated Democrats. Woof. This is not looking good for the Resistance. Here’s hoping that Mueller gets back on the right track soon so that he can impeach Trump once and for all."
"Incredible: Bethesda Revealed
That ‘Fallout 76’ Will Show What Earth
Would Be Like If The Arizona Diamondbacks Hadn’t Won The 2001 World Series",N/A,https://clickhole.com/incredible-bethesda-revealed-that-fallout-76-will-sh-1826545754/,"There’s a lot of mystery surrounding Bethesda’s newly announced game Fallout 76, but we now have one crucial piece of information about the hotly anticipated title. The game will be set in an alternate history where we get to see what the world would look like if the Arizona Diamondbacks did not win the 2001 World Series. Fallout 76 takes place in the post-apocalyptic future of 2102, players must struggle to survive in a dangerous world where the D-backs didn’t become World Series champions after defeating the Yankees four games to three back in 2001, and as a result nuclear war has destroyed civilization as we know it. On the game’s webpage, a tagline proclaims, “The Diamondbacks never won in 2001. Chaos has conquered the world. Who can survive?” In a stunning teaser trailer recently released online, we’re given a glimpse inside the subterranean shelter Vault 76, where 500 survivors of atomic winter have hidden for decades, taking shelter from the radioactive environment and horrible mutant monsters that ravaged the Earth after the Diamondbacks lost to the Yankees in the 2001 World Series. Even before Bethesda confirmed that the game is about a reality where the Diamondbacks failed to become world champions in 2001, fans who watched the video noticed there isn’t a single poster celebrating World Series co-MVPs Randy Johnson and Curt Schilling visible on the walls of the bunker. Furthermore, although we see several drawings of the iconic Fallout character Pip Boy visible in the underground dwelling, there isn’t a single illustration of Luis Gonzalez’s decisive walk-off hit in game 7 that clinched the series for Arizona. It’s a bizarre and unsettling universe very different from our own. We can’t wait to see what other horrors Bethesda has imagined for this nightmarish alternate timeline. It’s sure to give us a chilling—and action-packed—glimpse into what the world might have looked like if baseball history had turned out just a little bit differently. It’s safe to say that Fallout 76 is one title that gamers are already eagerly putting on their wishlists!"
Big Win For Safety: Dole Will Start Putting Warnings On Its Pineapples To Discourage Customers From Running Back Into Burning Buildings To Save Them,N/A,https://clickhole.com/big-win-for-safety-dole-will-start-putting-warnings-on-1825935836/,"If you’re ready for your daily dose of optimism, check out this story about a company that genuinely cares about its customers: Dole is going to start putting warnings on its pineapples to discourage people from running back into a burning building to save them. Thank goodness! This is a simple solution that is going to save a lot of lives. Dole announced earlier this week that starting in June, every Dole pineapple will be packaged with a sticker depicting a crossed-out drawing of fire and the phrase “It’s not worth it” to remind customers that they should never risk their lives in a crisis situation in order to save a Dole pineapple. “Thousands of people die senselessly every year trying to retrieve Dole pineapples from their burning homes after having escaped safely themselves, and we’re hoping that including a warning on our product will reduce this number dramatically,” said Dole spokesperson Nancy Wallbeck. “Pineapples may be a healthy and delicious snack, but they will never be as valuable as your own life or that of a member of your family, and that includes Dole pineapple juice and Dole pineapple parfait cups.” Wow. It’s great to hear that Dole is thinking about safety just as much as it’s thinking about taste.  This announcement should have all other companies looking up to Dole as a huge role model for public safety and corporate responsibility. Just because a pineapple has reached perfect ripeness, or because it kind of looks like a little pointy guy with green hair, doesn’t mean it’s worth the ultimate sacrifice—and this new warning sticker will ensure that people realize that. Thanks for looking out for us, Dole!"
Another Step For Progress: The Scripps National Spelling Bee Will Also Be Ending The Swimsuit Portion Of Its Competition,N/A,https://clickhole.com/another-step-for-progress-the-scripps-national-spellin-1826607619/,"Following the example set by the Miss America Competition, another major institution has just taken a huge step toward positive change: The Scripps National Spelling Bee will also be ending the swimsuit portion of its competition. For over 90 years, the bee has asked its contestants aged 15 and under to strut their stuff in form-fitting swimsuits at a convention center in Maryland to help determine the nation’s best speller, but as the country’s attitude toward body positivity has shifted, the leadership of the Scripps Howard Foundation has unanimously decided to remove the outdated event from the competition.  “While we like to honor the traditions of our spelling bee, we felt that the swimsuit portion puts too much focus on the physical appearances of the elementary and middle school students who are vying for the title of best speller,” said the Scripps Foundation’s president, Liz Carter. “By removing this part, we hope to promote body positivity and avoid scenarios like the 2013 contest, where the spelling bee champion placed eighth in spelling but really wowed judges with his SpongeBob Speedo.” Beautiful. Now, for the first time in decades, kids won’t have to worry if the shape and size of their body might play a factor in their dreams of winning the National Spelling Bee. This is truly a win for body-positivity advocates everywhere! "
National Crisis: The FBI Just Issued A Nationwide Crime Alert That A Man Once Stole A Big Bag Of Feathers From His Neighbor’s Car In 1995 And That Both The Man And His Neighbor Died Several Years Ago,N/A,https://clickhole.com/national-crisis-the-fbi-just-issued-a-nationwide-crime-1826335936/,"You might want to exercise a little extra caution as you go about your day today, because the FBI has issued a nationwide crime alert informing all Americans that a man once stole a big bag of feathers from his neighbor’s car in 1995 and that both the man and his neighbor died several years ago. Text your loved ones, because you’ll want to make sure they’re safe. “It is absolutely imperative that the American populace be on the lookout for a man carrying a stolen bag of feathers who died a while ago and also returned the feathers at some point to the guy he stole them from, who also died at some point, and also be aware that the bag of feathers got lost a few years ago,” said FBI director Christopher Wray in an emergency live broadcast that interrupted programming on all major television channels this morning. “If you have a bag of feathers in your own home, we urge you to move it to another room of your house or at least jiggle it around with your foot in order to protect it from this feather thief, who died in the early 2000s.”  The FBI added that it had dispatched an undercover agent 15 years ago to investigate this incident, but had sent him to the wrong state and also that he retired a while ago. All Americans are urged to take the necessary precautions. In light of this announcement, a state of emergency has been declared in the town of Raleigh, North Carolina, which is 600 miles away from where the crime took place, and is a city that neither the feather thief nor his neighbor have ever been. Residents of Raleigh are urged to stay indoors until the FBI has arrested either the man who stole the feathers or the man he stole the feathers from, both of whom are deceased and buried in cemeteries on opposite sides of the country. While it’s unclear how long this crime alert will last, the FBI has announced that the stolen bag of feathers was a mix of goose feathers and pigeon feathers and that the bag was either black, brown, purple, or colorless and then reconfirmed that both people involved in the incident from 23 years ago are both deceased.  Agents say that anyone who sees the bag of feathers should either run away from it screaming, tell the FBI about it, or steal it for themselves and keep it in their house to look at if they like feathers. They also added that the bag was burned in a furnace six years ago. Hopefully the FBI can wrap up its investigation soon and we as a nation can put this whole ugly situation behind us!"
Yes! Every 2019 Nissan Will Have Airbags That Eject At Random Every So Often Because Nissan Works Really Hard On Them And Wants People To See Them,N/A,https://clickhole.com/yes-every-2019-nissan-will-have-airbags-that-eject-at-1826600275/,"If you’re in the market for a car, get excited, because Nissan is about to roll out an incredible new feature for all of its new models that will probably convince you to buy from the company: Every 2019 Nissan will have airbags that eject at random because Nissan works really hard on its airbags and it wants people to see them! Previously, the Japanese car manufacturer’s airbags would only deploy in the event of a serious collision or rapid deceleration, which severely limited the number of people who had the chance to admire a dependable, professionally crafted Nissan airbag. But now, Nissan is pulling out all the stops so that even the most careful drivers can see one of its top-quality fabric airbags when they eject at approximately 200 mph without any warning or provocation whatsoever.  “For so long, no matter how much time and effort we put into making them, our airbags have received little to no recognition from drivers who don’t get into serious accidents,” said Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa. “Now, that’s all going to change. After years of working hard to design some of the best airbags in the industry, we’re going to ensure that all our drivers have a chance to see one up close by having the airbags deploy for no reason every once in a while. Whether you’re on the highway or pulling out of your garage, or just parked on the side of the road, not moving at all, every Nissan customer can anticipate that their driver, passenger, and side airbags will activate at any moment, finally giving them a chance to appreciate all the work Nissan puts into its top-of-the-line safety features.” Soon, thousands of drivers will get the surprise of realizing exactly what makes Nissan airbags so special, as well as just how great of a choice they made in buying a Nissan. Simply amazing. Hey, Nissan, take our money, please!"
Major Breakthrough: Medical Researchers Just Announced That A 400-Pound Child Simply Ain’t Right,N/A,https://clickhole.com/major-breakthrough-medical-researchers-just-announced-1825904110/,"Here’s some major health news that is totally going to change the way we think about the human body: A group of medical researchers just announced that a 400-pound child simply ain’t right. After a decades-long cohort study, the group of researchers from Johns Hopkins University has concluded that when a young child weighs 400 pounds or more, that just ain’t what the lord above intended: “Oh, no no no. Uh-uh. Kids should not be that big, no siree,” lead researcher Michael Zimmern explained, adding a low whistle as he glanced at a PowerPoint slide depicting a diagram of a 450-pound 10-year-old’s body. “Our rigorous analysis has led us to conclude that sometimes you just feel it in your bones when something ain’t kosher, and that there ain’t kosher.” Well, there you have it. It’s good to know that some of the top medical experts in the country are making strides on this important health topic. Though the researchers did not focus their study on the factors that might be leading these children to grow to twice the size of the average adult male, they did speculate that when it comes to 400-pound kids’ health, something’s gotta be goin’ real, real wrong, and their findings open the door for future studies into questions like “What in God’s name they feedin’ these poor SOBs?” As a final note of warning, the researchers added that any parents with a child weighing in at over 375 oughta do something about it, and quick, or the gummint people might be by to have a word. Wow. What a huge revelation for the medical community! Our hats are off to the Johns Hopkins team that worked tirelessly to come to this conclusion—we won’t be surprised if it has implications for 400-pound children for years to come."
White House In Disarray: A Peacock Just Walked Through The Oval Office And Donald Trump Just Stared At It Until It Left And Didn’t Say Anything Or Tell Anyone,N/A,https://clickhole.com/white-house-in-disarray-a-peacock-just-walked-through-1825910299/,"Well, here is just further proof that, almost 18 months into his presidency, Donald Trump’s White House is still in total chaos: A peacock just walked through the Oval Office and Donald Trump just stared at it until it left and didn’t say anything or tell anyone. This is seriously unacceptable. Mr. Trump, it’s time you get your White House in order. The whole disaster started this morning when a brightly colored peacock walked through the door of the Oval Office as President Trump sat signing papers and started pecking around the floor. In an incredible display of mismanagement, Trump did not shoo the peacock away or alert anybody on his staff to its presence, but instead sat straight up in his chair and stared right at the large bird as he quietly watched it strut around his desk.  At this point in Trump’s presidency, you would hope that he would have at least been prepared to respond in some way when, after spending several minutes preening itself on the Oval Office sofa while Trump watched silently, the peacock fanned out its tail and knocked a portrait of Andrew Jackson off the Oval Office wall. Yet Trump remained completely motionless and simply looked on passively as the peacock turned and stared at him for about 15 seconds, then turned and walked past him back out into the White House hallway. Trump hasn’t mentioned the peacock to a single member of his staff. It seems like the peacock that walked through the Oval Office is going to be a secret that Trump takes with him to the grave, and that’s simply inexcusable. The American people deserve better than an administration so disjointed that moments after seeing an ornate bird walk through his office, the president would do nothing more than write “peacock” in the margins of his notepad and then continue on with his work as if nothing had happened. The Trump Administration has some serious explaining to do. If a peacock can walk through the Oval Office without any consequences, then the White House is in a state of unprecedented disarray, and we can expect some serious repercussions in the not-so-distant future."
The Perils Of Climate Change: Rising Sea Levels Could Force Over 100 Million Americans To Have Rock-Hard Beach Bodies By 2050,N/A,https://clickhole.com/the-perils-of-climate-change-rising-sea-levels-could-f-1825999436/,"If you think climate change is something that won’t really affect our planet until some hazy, far-off future, you better think again: Rising sea levels could force over 100 million Americans to have rock-hard beach bodies by 2050. In a sobering statement this week, researchers reported that Earth’s projected temperature rise of 3 degrees could push coastlines dramatically inland over the next few decades, and the newly formed beaches will force Midwesterners to become perfect tens, tragically unable to continue to hide their doughy bodies as they strut their stuff by the pier.  “We’re going to be seeing devastating numbers of red-hot hunks and beach bunnies swimming in the waves, and we’re going to be seeing them as far inland as western Ohio,” reported Dr. Sara Viscuso, one of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s lead scientists. “With this country’s lack of a comprehensive climate change policy, it’s only a matter of time before the Midwest sees a huge spike in hardbodies laying out in the sand, looking all fine. We predict that by the end of the century, most citizens of Iowa and Missouri will have no choice but to get tan and sculpted bodies as the Atlantic Coast spills into their states and creates countless opportunities for playing beach volleyball or oiling up pecs with cocoa butter.” For communities already in coastal areas, infrastructure adjustments that would allow for a higher number of banging beach bods may be somewhat manageable, but others further inland face a severe deficiency in gyms, tanning beds, and tiki bars. And government bodies have been largely inactive if not ignorant toward coastal erosion, meaning that American citizens will be left largely to fend for themselves as they are forced to transform into glistening, Speedo-wearing beach hunks and blonde bombshells in barely-there bikinis. Wow. We need to start fighting seriously against climate change, or we could see levels of summertime eye candy that are virtually unheard of. It looks like the time for action is now."
Inspirational? Something Happened In Lithuania With A Sick Little Boy And An Abandoned Dog And An Ant-Man Costume But We Can’t Quite Put The Pieces Together Using Google Translate,N/A,https://clickhole.com/inspirational-something-happened-in-lithuania-with-a-s-1826154619/,"Well, this story we found on a Lithuanian website seems pretty heartwarming as far as we can tell from what little we’ve been able to translate into English: Something happened with a sick little boy and an abandoned dog and an Ant-Man costume, and we can’t quite put the pieces together using Google Translate but it looks like it could be inspirational. Yep, you’re probably going to want to get the tissues ready when you read this one, because whatever went down with this boy and dog and Ant-Man costume seems like it might have been life-affirming based on what we can suss out given the language barrier! The story was originally published in Lithuanian on a website called TaipTaip.it, and after copying and pasting it into Google Translate, we were able to figure out that its opening sentence means something like “A boy became a dog today in the most tremendous way possible”—which clearly isn’t a perfect translation, but seems to indicate that maybe either a boy saved a dog’s life or vice versa. The article goes on to explain that before the story took place, the boy was “sick with quite negative of illness” and that the dog was “vien tik liūdnas ir vienišas amžinai,” which apparently means “nothing more than loveless and forsaken.”  It definitely isn’t crystal clear what happened, but it sounds both touching and adorable from what we can understand. Based on what we were able to glean from the Lithuanian-to-English translation Google gave us, the boy and the dog either met each other for the first time or reunited after a long separation—which made everyone in their town say something that roughly translates to “gorgeous like a painting.” That was when a man who the article refers to as an “adult God” came in wearing an Ant-Man costume, and the sick boy began (according to Google Translate) to “jump and sway” with “the true feeling of fervor.” We can’t be a hundred percent sure what all of that adds up to, but it definitely sounds like it could be the kind of thing that would warm people’s hearts and inspire them to treat each other better. It seems safe to say that this whole situation looks like it has to do with friendship, or overcoming adversity, or compassion for a sick child, or maybe all of those things. So far, hundreds of Lithuanian people have commented on the article with a phrase that Google has translated to “absolutely delicious,” which we have to assume means that whatever happened with the little boy and the abandoned dog and the guy in the Ant-Man costume was in some way a positive. We were not able to determine why most paragraphs in the article end with a mention of a woman named Ugne, who is described as the “Christmas ballerina” with “no room for child or mutt in her vast garage,” nor did we find any clues as to whether Ugne figures into the story in a positive or negative way. But we do know conclusively that the article includes a word that translates to “sawdust” over 60 times, which must be in the context of some Lithuanian idiom about sawdust. Whatever “they danced for hours with hearts like lightbulbs full of sawdust” means, we’re going to operate under the assumption that it indicates something good in Lithuania. It’s hard to say exactly what happened with the boy and dog and Ant-Man costume, but it’s pretty clear that it was probably a nice situation that should bring a smile to your face. You can stand up just a little taller today knowing that people like the boy and the guy in the Ant-Man costume exist and are out there doing things that by the looks of it seem pretty inspirational. To the little boy, the adult man, and the abandoned dog, congratulations or we’re very sorry, depending on whether what happened to you in Lithuania was good or bad!"

As soon as ninth-grader Eric Rollins walked into her morning social studies class sporting his MAGA hat, his teacher, 34-year-old Amanda Higgins, stepped up by immediately pulling him out into the hallway and telling him point-blank that she would no longer be meeting him in secret to have sex in the football field snack stand during study halls.

"Extraordinary Discovery: Researchers Have Determined That Tweety Bird And Betty Boop Have The Exact Same Skeleton, Just Different Skin",N/A,https://clickhole.com/extraordinary-discovery-medical-researchers-at-harvard-1826382733/,"This is truly an amazing day for science: A team of medical researchers at Harvard has announced that Tweety Bird and Betty Boop have the exact same skeleton, just different skin. “Our research has revealed that there is no difference between Tweety Bird and Betty Boop’s gigantic skulls, which both have eye sockets the size of grapefruits, and the very small bones comprising their tiny bodies are completely identical as well,” said biologist Dr. Janice Kaminsky, who led the team of Harvard scientists who made this watershed discovery. “If you found the fossilized remains of Tweety Bird and Betty Boop, you would not be able to tell which one is which. You’d just be looking at two versions of the same skeletons next to one another.” To complete the study, which was published earlier this week in the influential peer-reviewed journal Nature, scientists conducted a meticulous analysis of every single bone in Betty Boop and Tweety Bird’s bodies, from their extremely bulbous hip bones to the unique vertebrae structure that makes it look like both characters’ necks are basically absent. In every case, they found that Betty Boop and Tweety Bird both have the exact same number of bones, and that each bone is the exact same size. The study has also found that if you plucked out Tweety Bird’s feathers, he would look like a clone of Betty Boop, and, conversely, if you tarred and feathered Betty Boop, she would look like a clone of Tweety Bird. This is a pretty amazing moment in the history of science, and leading biologists are already hailing the discovery of as a completely revolutionary moment for the field. It’s safe to say that this watershed study of Betty Boop and Tweety Bird’s identical bone structures will change the way that scientists study their anatomy for years to come."
"A Piece Of History: The Bulletproof Helmet JFK Took Off So He Could Let His Long, Luscious Hair Blow Freely In The Wind On The Day He Died Is Coming To The Smithsonian ",N/A,https://clickhole.com/a-piece-of-history-the-bulletproof-helmet-jfk-took-off-1826482098/,"The shocking assassination of President John F. Kennedy is one of the darkest days in U.S. history, and one that irrevocably changed the course of the nation. Now, almost 55 years after Lee Harvey Oswald robbed the country of its young and promising leader, a critical relic from that fateful day will be put on display for all to see: The bulletproof helmet JFK took off so he could let his long, luscious hair blow freely in the wind on the day that he died is coming to The Smithsonian. Starting this month, the iconic helmet will be the centerpiece of the National Museum of American History’s new exhibit on the 35th president’s final moments, raising the question of what could have been if JFK had only left the life-saving device on his head and deprived the American public what would be its final glimpses of his handsome, flowing mane blowing in the warm Texas breeze. Those who were alive on that day in 1963 will never forget where they were when they heard that JFK had been fatally shot after turning to the crowd outside his Lincoln Continental en route to Dealey Plaza and shouting, “A day this gorgeous really makes a president want to take his hair down!” As the horde of adoring fans who had come out in droves in hopes of catching a glimpse of the president’s beautiful hair cascading in the wind cheered loudly, JFK raised the protective visor of the bulletproof helmet to sweep his long, dreamy bangs out of his eyes. “The only thing more dangerous than removing that helmet, Mr. President,” said the Secret Service member fatefully riding alongside him in the convertible, “would be depriving the American public of your luscious locks.”  Those would be the last words JFK ever heard. Wolf whistles turned to cries of anguish as the president was struck dead just as he was letting his beautiful strawberry blond hair gently cascade down his lower back. A shot fired by Lee Harvey Oswald from a nearby building cut his life devastatingly short, and it all could have been prevented had JFK not removed that protective helmet to allow the American people the treat of seeing his thick, navel-length hair bouncing in the wind. In addition to the helmet, the Smithsonian will be displaying Jackie Kennedy’s pink Chanel scrunchie, which was stained with blood as she attempted to stop the blood loss by pulling JFK’s hair into a topknot. The museum has also acquired never-before-seen photos of Lyndon B. Johnson being sworn into the presidency on Air Force One, his long hair pulled gracefully back into two demure French braids. Although we may never know what the country would look like today if JFK had been able to live out his term as president, the Smithsonian’s exhibit offers a detailed and sobering glimpse into his final moments as the president whose hair was a waterfall of blond treasure. If you find yourself in D.C. in the next few months, this must-see exhibit should definitely be at the top of your itinerary."
Meeting Of The Minds: President Trump And Kim Kardashian Convened In The Oval Office Yesterday To Tell Each Other That They’ve Been On TV,N/A,https://clickhole.com/meeting-of-the-minds-president-trump-and-kim-kardashia-1826455071/,"Taking time out of their busy schedules to discuss matters of mutual importance, President Donald Trump and reality star Kim Kardashian convened in the Oval Office yesterday to let each other know that they’ve been on TV. After greeting one another with a prolonged series of bows to convey respect, the high profile pair then sat down at the Resolute desk and quickly got down to business. “Mr. President, I would like for you to know that I have been on TV before,” said Kardashian, opening the important dialogue. “I have been on TV also,” Trump countered in a firm yet civil tone. “Have you been on TV?” “I am confident that I have, yes,” Kardashian replied, prompting the president to nod approvingly. “Thank you for telling me this, Kevin,” said Trump, adding, “I am beginning to gather that we have both been on TV.” “I would have to agree, because now that I think about it, I have also been on TV,” she responded. The pair then shook hands as the press pool took a flurry of photographs of the historic meeting. “We are on TV right now,” Trump proceeded to announce before switching on the television near his desk and turning to an episode of Mike & Molly. “See? Here we are.” “I believe so, yes,” Kardashian agreed. “This is us on TV.” Trump then got up, went into the adjoining bathroom, and used the toilet with the door wide open while an unattended Kardashian pressed all the buttons on the Resolute desk and whistled quietly to herself. Moments later, Trump burst through the east wall of the Oval Office on a riding lawnmower and introduced himself to Kardashian, believing her to be his wife. Speaking in serious tones, the two then told each other several more times that they’d been on TV before finally concluding the meeting, at which point the president wandered out into the White House Rose Garden, took off his shirt, and fell asleep facedown in a bed of tulips. Though it does not seem that the Trump-Kardashian summit will lead to any concrete changes in U.S. policy, the pair’s marquee meeting marks the first time in White House history that the celebrity guest star of Wrestlemania 23 and the celebrity guest star of Wrestlemania 24 have convened in the Oval Office for formal discussions."
"This Looks Bad: The President
Of The National Dairy Council Threw Up And Resigned At A Press Conference After
A Reporter Told Him Where Milk Comes From",N/A,https://clickhole.com/this-looks-bad-the-president-of-the-national-dairy-cou-1825902757/,"The president of the National Dairy Council just suffered through a PR nightmare today. During a routine press conference to talk about the health benefits of milk, council president Jeff Carr threw up on camera after a reporter told him where milk comes from.  Yikes. This is definitely a bad look for the National Dairy Council. The incident occurred early on in the press conference when a reporter asking a question about U.S. dairy manufacturing mentioned in passing to Carr that milk comes out of a cow’s udders. Upon learning this, the dairy business leader immediately grew pale and projectile-vomited all over his podium. The numerous photographers in the room snapped pictures as the dairy council president violently threw up for several minutes, stopping only once to gasp the words, “Oh god, I put milk on my cereal this morning and it’s basically cow piss,” before beginning to vomit again. After a long period of dry-heaving and moaning that it was “fucking disgusting” that milk came from “a big pink sack covered in warts,” the now haggard and disheveled dairy industry leader returned to the vomit-stained podium and in a weak voice croaked out that he was resigning effective immediately because milk is too gross for him to endorse. He then hobbled out of the room, while calling out for someone to bring him “a slice of good wholesome cheese to get the taste of milk out of my mouth.” The National Dairy Council says it is currently looking for a new president to replace Carr, but everyone it’s asked has immediately vomited upon learning that milk comes from the swollen mammary glands of a cow. It’s definitely a dark time for the agency, and it’s going to take it a while to recover from this major PR disaster."
Entering The Fray: Led Zeppelin Has Reunited To Release A Diss Track Aimed At Drake,N/A,https://clickhole.com/entering-the-fray-led-zeppelin-has-reunited-to-release-1826425696/,"It looks like the bitter feud between Drake and Pusha T is only picking up steam as legendary rock band Led Zeppelin has now officially joined the fray by reuniting for the first time since 2007 to release a diss track aimed at Drake. Drake must be feeling the shade from all angles as this morning Jimmy Page, John Paul Jones, and Robert Plant released a statement on the official Led Zeppelin website announcing that they have spent the past day jamming in the studio and will soon release a new, eight-minute blues-and-hard-rock track calling out Drake for using a ghostwriter and donning blackface. “We are very excited to announce that Led Zeppelin is in the studio for first time in nearly 40 years recording a track that will shine some important light on the fakest ‘rapper’ in the game and feature a scintillating solo from the one and only Jimmy Page,” the statement read. Wow, this is getting ugly. Needless to say, hearing Robert Plant’s iconic crooning pile on the insults is not going to make Drake happy, but if this feud continues inspiring new work from these great artists, we’re 100 percent here for it."
More Bad Press For Elon: The Car Elon Musk Launched Into Orbit Has Fallen Back Down To Earth And Crushed Malala Yousafzai,N/A,https://clickhole.com/more-bad-press-for-elon-the-car-elon-musk-launched-int-1826423029/,"After going on a petulant Twitter tirade against the media that was applauded by anti-Semites and after facing months of scrutiny on his failing businesses, the last thing Elon Musk needs is more bad press, but instead, he has another PR nightmare on his hands: The Tesla Elon launched into orbit in February fell back down to Earth and crushed Malala Yousafzai.  Um, yeah, Elon’s personal Tesla Roadster landing in a ball of flames on top of Nobel Peace Prize winner and tireless champion for girls’ rights Malala Yousafzai is not helping to rehab the embattled Silicon Valley billionaire one iota. According to reports, Yousafzai had been taking a walk outside her Birmingham, England home when the bright red sports car came careening down from 70 miles above the Earth’s surface to land right on top of her, leaving nothing but a smoldering crater behind. The successful launch of his car into orbit has been one of the few recent bright spots for Musk, and now it will be forever linked to the tragic and untimely death of the 20-year-old activist who has inspired millions around the globe with her amazing advocacy for peace and education. Yikes. Suffice it to say, this is not a good look for Musk, whom Twitter has made a sport of piling onto at this point. Godspeed to his publicist today."
Responding To Criticism: ICE Has Issued A Statement Informing The Public That They Should Just Be Happy It’s Not Doing Experiments On These Kids,N/A,https://clickhole.com/responding-to-criticism-ice-has-issued-a-statement-inf-1826392956/,"Despite the avalanche of criticism U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has received over not being able to account for 1,475 migrant children, the immigration enforcement agency is not backing down an inch: ICE just released a statement insisting that its critics should honestly just be glad it isn’t performing experiments on migrant children.  “President Trump has given us a blank check to treat the immigrants in our custody however we want with zero consequence, so the next time you’re mad at us for losing track of these kids who have no legal protection, remember the restraint we’ve shown by not testing chemical warfare agents on them in a lab somewhere off the books,” reads the statement issued by ICE officials, which went on to elaborate just how grateful we should be for the way things are now considering the complete absence of accountability they’re operating under. “The American public can’t even imagine the perverse experiments we could get away with behind closed doors in ICE detention centers, and if we were to take full advantage of that leeway, it’d be more nauseating and horrific than the American public could handle. You’d better thank your lucky stars that we only separate kids from their parents and have no desire to subject them to medical experiments that’d result in 50 new points being added to the Nuremberg Code, because we absolutely could.” Wow, ICE is certainly on the defensive, and by the looks of it, it isn’t going to end any of its controversial practices anytime soon. Let’s just hope it continues restraining itself from turning migrants into lab subjects, because in America, migrant communities can use all the mercy they can get."
"Presidential Temper Tantrum: After His Classmates Spilled Pigs’ Blood On Him At Prom, Trump Totally Overreacted By Using His Psychic Powers To Massacre The Whole School [CORRECTION: The Person That Used Their Psychic Powers To Massacre A School Was Carrie, Not Donald Trump]",N/A,https://clickhole.com/presidential-temper-tantrum-after-his-classmates-spill-1826386850/,"[UPDATED, May 29, 2018—PLEASE SEE CORRECTION AT BOTTOM.] It’s no secret that our thin-skinned POTUS takes every insult personally, but his latest temper tantrum is a new low even for him. According to reports, when his classmates spilled pigs’ blood on Trump’s dress at prom, he immaturely lashed out with his psychic powers and slaughtered everyone in the school. Seems like the toddler in chief needs his diaper changed, because Trump using his telekinesis to murder everyone at prom is a national embarrassment. Look, we’re not condoning bullying, but no amount of taunting justifies Trump mentally locking all the doors of a gymnasium so he could enact his lethal revenge on the kids that laughed at him. But apparently in Trump’s childlike and incredibly powerful mind, any slight deserves a response as extreme as levitating a fire hose to spray a crowd of panicking prom attendees and then electrocuting the principal to death. The United States used to be a land where the president didn’t set the school on fire to kill all his classmates, but Trump is assaulting that cherished American tradition. Have you no shame, Mr. Trump? You have tarnished the office of the presidency by unleashing your latent psionic powers to ruin a dance that should have been the highlight of the entire school year. Under Trump’s corrupt administration even gym teacher Ms. Collins, who showed him kindness and tried to defend him from bullying, was crushed to death during the orange baby’s telekinetic hissy fit. Drumpf has no loyalty to anyone or anything besides himself, proving he is the most egotistical prom queen in U.S. history. You’d hope that Republicans would have the courage to speak up and condemn Trump’s egregious behavior at prom, but there’s just crickets from Congress. Even when President Cheeto murdered his own mother by making knives fly across the room to crucify her, that didn’t earn a peep from human turtle Mitch McConnell. The only people who have shown an ounce of backbone during this whole debacle are popular girl Chris and her boyfriend, Billy, who at least tried to run over Teflon Don with their car, a heroic action that was no less brave just because he flipped their vehicle just by looking at it and survived unscathed. The free world deserves a leader that’s better than a short-fingered prom-incinerating vulgarian. Donald Trump burns in hell, but that’s small consolation when President Pee-Pee is also occupying the Oval Office. Impeachment can’t come soon enough for this telepathic freak. CORRECTION: Due to an editorial oversight, this article incorrectly attributed the massacre at Bates High School’s senior prom to Donald Trump. In actuality, the telekinetic murderer responsible for these deaths is Carrie White from the motion picture Carrie. ResistanceHole regrets the error."
Animal Rights FTW: PETA Has Launched A New Ad Campaign Encouraging People To Use Non-Leather Belts For Autoerotic Asphyxiation,N/A,https://clickhole.com/animal-rights-ftw-peta-has-launched-a-new-ad-campaign-1825999671/,"If you’re a passionate defender of animals, your heart is going to sing when you hear about PETA’s latest effort to end the use of cruel products. They’ve just launched a major new ad campaign encouraging the use of non-leather belts during autoerotic asphyxiation. Beautiful. This is a major victory for animal rights. “Anyone who is planning on choking themselves out with a belt while masturbating needs to understand that just because you’re chasing the sexual thrill of a lifetime doesn’t mean you have to kill an animal to do it,” said PETA spokesman Darius Clemens. “This new ad campaign is PETA’s way of saying that when you orgasm while strangling yourself with a cruelty-free nylon belt, you’ll still experience the same unparalleled rush of pleasure that comes from strangling yourself with a belt made from an animal’s skin.” In PETA’s typical edgy, bold style, the campaign’s disturbing videos feature nude men and women in various stages of undress with animal parts such as severed cows’ tails and dead snakes wrapped around their necks. With no soundtrack outside of the red-faced actors’ gasps for air and moans of pleasure, a gritty-voiced narrator asks, “If you wouldn’t kill a snake and use it to choke yourself while you jack off, why are you using a python-skin belt? End cruelty. Don’t stop an animal’s breath just to stop yours.” PETA believes the ads could potentially steer millions away from using leather belts for autoerotic asphyxiation when they see that the ethical alternatives are just as effective, and it will be interesting to see if their humane message reaches breath-play traditionalists. Regardless of what you think of its controversial methods, you’ve got to admit that PETA is willing to do whatever it takes to protect the lives of animals everywhere!"
Heartbreaking: This Guy’s Uncle Is Racist But Not Quite Racist Enough For Him To Get Any Viral Content Out Of It,N/A,https://clickhole.com/heartbreaking-this-guy-s-uncle-is-racist-but-not-quite-1826327542/,"Fellow liberal activists, get ready to feel for this guy, because he’s living out any #Resistance member’s absolute nightmare: His uncle is racist, but not quite racist enough for him to get any viral content out of it. This is truly the worst of both worlds. The only thing more painful than listening to a relative spew ignorant, hateful views is not being able to leverage those outbursts for online attention. Twenty-five-year-old Zack Daley has tried over and over to film his uncle Dave when he starts up on a thinly veiled racist rant about how “immigrants are stealing American jobs,” but the tirade never gets quite toxic enough to be the kind of thing that would get hundreds of thousands of retweets and end with his uncle’s address getting published on Reddit. If Zack’s uncle were only slightly more hateful about it when he started making the point that slavery is “just a part of American history,” Zack would be able to heroically document it in a Facebook video that millions of people would watch in horror—but unfortunately, his uncle’s comments are just not quite bigoted enough. This is a devastating loss for the #Resistance. With a slightly more bombastic uncle, Zack could totally expose American racism for what it is and get nonstop likes and faves in the process, or even a retweet from Rachel Maddow. There’s no question that Zack’s uncle’s speeches about Sharia law come from a racist place, but a casual internet viewer would have to spend at least a couple of minutes listening to one before getting to the part where he talks about “the Muslims” as if they all share a single set of opinions and characteristics—making the video not quite punchy enough to get much traction on even the slowest Twitter day. If Zack’s uncle were to snap and yell something about Trump’s wall at a Latino waiter just once, Zack would be viral in no time, but unfortunately Dave has kept his hatred at bay up till now. The general distaste for “urban people” that Dave expresses just isn’t going to cut it. Making things even more gut-wrenching is that Zack already has a ton of quippy Tweets and one-liners to accompany a wide array of racist tirades his uncle might potentially go on, but so far they have tragically all gone un-posted. Yep—this is pretty much as bad as it gets. We’re crossing our fingers that Zack’s uncle finally loses it and does something truly despicable soon, because otherwise Zack’s not getting any viral content out of this awful situation."

Powerful: The Cast Of ‘The West Wing’ Reunited In Richard Schiff’s Garage Last Night To Say The Words ‘Resist Trump’ Back And Forth To Each Other Without Filming It,N/A,https://clickhole.com/powerful-the-cast-of-the-west-wing-reunited-in-richa-1826293091/,"Members of the #Resistance itching for a high-profile takedown of our commander in cheat, Donald Drumpf, AND a reunion of the best show ever got an early Christmas present today: The cast of The West Wing reunited in actor Richard Schiff’s garage last night to say the phrase “Resist Trump” back and forth to each other without filming it. Hell yeah. You’re going to want to keep an eye on the orange buffoon these next few days. This is bound to throw that flaming sack of dogshit into a tailspin! After most of the legendary cast of The West Wing had assembled in Schiff’s two-car garage at 7 p.m. Wednesday, Schiff flicked the lights to get everyone’s attention before saying what is sure to be the rallying cry of the era: “Resist Trump.” If Drumpf is under the impression that he has cowed the American people with his tyranny, he is sadly mistaken, because it didn’t take long after Schiff had said “Resist Trump” for Bradley Whitford, known for playing fan-favorite Josh Lyman, to stand up and answer, “Resist Trump,” at which point Schiff turned to Whitford and said, “Resist Trump,” again. That would have been cool enough, but then Allison Janney (OMG Allison Janney!!!) reportedly said, “Resist Trump,” from the cooler she was sitting on, and then everyone was off to the races saying “Resist Trump” to one another in a devastating act of unity (and total #squadgoals!) that showed President Tiny Hands that the #Resistance will not go silently into the night, even if none of these liberal heroes thought to film this incredible moment. But even after saying “Resist Trump” to each other for three amazing, unrecorded hours in Schiff’s garage, the best was still yet to come. At around 10:15 p.m., the garage door slowly opened, and there stood President Bartlet himself, Martin Sheen, who looked around at his former castmates, cleared his throat, and said, “Resist Trump,” causing everyone to echo the sentiment for another two hours. Um, can we get President Jed Bartlet in the Oval Office, like, right now? We can only imagine how viral this video would have gone had even one of the stars taken their phone out to record even a few seconds of this amazing display of #Resistance, but the mere fact that it happened at all has to have Trump and his lackeys quaking in fear. Yeah, we wouldn’t be surprised if President Dump, usurper of the free world, decides to cower away in his Mar-a-Lago hidey-hole after this openly defiant act. And to the actors of The West Wing who put themselves on the line and took part in this powerful event that no one will ever see or hear, we salute you."
The Discovery Channel Is Apologizing To Its Viewers After Realizing That The MythBusters Were Clearly Nerds,N/A,https://clickhole.com/the-discovery-channel-is-apologizing-to-its-viewers-aft-1825787529/,"Here’s some huge TV news that anyone who’s watched the popular series MythBusters is going to want to read up on ASAP: The Discovery Channel is apologizing to its viewers after realizing that the MythBusters were clearly nerds. Representatives of the Discovery Channel said they first noticed that the MythBusters might be nerds after they aired an episode of the show that featured hosts Adam Savage and Jamie Hyneman spending two entire days building a giant ball made of LEGOs for the sole purpose of seeing whether it would be possible to make the ball roll, an activity that executives at the channel called “the dorkiest shit in the history of the world.”  After an internal investigation, the Discovery Channel found that the MythBusters spent all of their time on the show doing poindexter bullshit like building their own working trebuchets, drawing little math problems in their embarrassing science workshop, and basically just doing a bunch of uncool techie experiments. “We would like to express our sincere apologies for the 14 years that we have spent exposing viewers to the nerds on MythBusters—we recently made the horrifying discovery that Adam Savage and Jamie Hyneman are into lame-ass nerd stuff that literally no normal person cares about,” said Discovery spokesperson Bryan Jankowski. “We at the Discovery Channel are shocked and ashamed that we gave a platform to such huge geeks, and effective immediately we are pulling all available episodes of MythBusters from Amazon Prime, Hulu, and YouTube.” The network has expressed its intention to steer clear of additional programming relating to science, engineering, and other dorky stuff like that until this bombshell blows over. It looks like the Discovery Channel is doing its best to make things right, so here’s hoping they can earn back its audience’s trust after subjecting them to a bunch of nerds for so long."
Incredibly Generous: Eminem Invited A Dying Fan Onstage And Straight Up Demolished Her With His Most Devastating Freestyle Yet,N/A,https://clickhole.com/incredibly-generous-eminem-invited-a-dying-fan-onstage-1825999707/,"Get ready for a heartwarming story about a celebrity who is using their fame for a really amazing purpose: At his concert at the Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia last night, Eminem invited a dying fan on stage and straight-up demolished her with his most devastating freestyle yet. Wow. What an amazing way to give back to a fan! When 31-year-old Nadine Ritter showed up to see Eminem last night, she was just looking to be distracted from her recent brain-cancer diagnosis and had no idea that she would be pulled on stage and absolutely destroyed by her favorite artist’s improvised verses pointing out all her flaws. Little did she realize that her amazing sister had contacted Eminem on a whim, explaining that Nadine had been given three months left to live, and the generous megastar had immediately offered to freestyle some burns that would annihilate her busted ass. Yes! It’s so inspiring to see that fame hasn’t stopped Slim Shady from being a good person. Nadine was completely overwhelmed with emotion when after a rousing rendition of “Lose Yourself,” Eminem said, “I’d like to bring up a very brave fan to the stage,” then reached to help her up and continued, “Get a load of this crusty fucker, Philadelphia!” Concert attendees say that without missing a beat, Eminem gave her the incredible opportunity to get torn to shreds by one of the greatest rappers of all time: “Doctors gonna give you a standing ‘O’ when you finally pass / They need three iron lungs to fit your whole ass,” Eminem spat at Nadine while she wept with joy and 20,000 fans cheered. From calling her breathing tube a “dick she’s giving history’s worst blowjob” to telling her that if she were on life support he would’ve pulled the plug yesterday, Eminem left no stone unturned in his astounding four-minute freestyle that warmed the heart of everyone in attendance. And if you thought Eminem couldn’t get more amazing, think again, because he seamlessly got the crowd to tear her to shreds, too, when he asked them to stand up and chant “Hella gross skank with an oxygen tank!” at her. Reportedly, Ritter’s face lit up with absolute joy when Slim Shady ended the freestyle with his most cutthroat verse of the night: “Looking like the Ghost of Bitchmas Past with your face all contorted / You’re a hospice whore I would’ve late-term aborted.” Damn. This proves that Eminem really knows how to go above and beyond for his fans. Other musicians, take note, because this is how it’s done. "
"Repressing Freedom: China Is Censoring Amir Out Of All ‘Jake And Amir’ Videos So That Citizens Do Not
Idolize His Slothful, Imbecile Ways",N/A,https://clickhole.com/repressing-freedom-china-is-censoring-amir-out-of-all-1825900621/,"The Chinese government has long limited its citizens’ access to the internet, but this most recent step is their most repressive yet, and will control what billions of people can see online: State censors have ordered that Amir be edited out of all Jake And Amir videos to prevent Chinese citizens from copying his slothful and foolish behavior. There’s no question about it: China has declared war on Amir Blumenfeld and is determined to purge the web clean of his clownish antics within the CollegeHumor office.  The harsh proclamation that has internet watchdogs reeling decrees that “to promote a harmonious and productive society free of negative role models, the discordant buffoonery of Amir is prohibited without exception.” To enforce this far-reaching order, the edict also commands government internet monitors to excise Amir from all Jake And Amir videos and rename the series as The People’s Jake so that the rule-following Jake Hurwitz can serve as a positive example of a diligent and industrious employee for all of China to emulate. In America we take freedoms like getting to see both Jake and Amir for granted, but beyond the Great Firewall, all you can find are clips of Jake silently working at his desk without any unwanted distractions. Even looking for Amir’s name on Chinese search engines is no longer possible, with the terms “Amir” and “Blumenfeld” only returning videos with titles like “Responsible Jake Enjoys An Afternoon Of Quiet Labor” or “Serene Jake, The Only Employee Of CollegeHumor.com, Sits Entirely Alone.” Technically savvy Chinese internet users that try to bypass web filters and access unaltered videos, where Amir does rude things that aggravate Jake, now risk decades-long prison sentences.  There’s no denying that China is correct about Amir being a dim-witted and irresponsible miscreant, which is more than proven by examples like the infamous video where Amir tries to steal Jake’s bowl of cereal. However, banning Amir entirely is a dystopian assault on freedom of speech and a slippery slope to stricter regulation. The world can only hope China doesn’t continue down this path of totalitarian thought control. "
Incredible Realism: The Campaign In The Next ‘Call Of Duty’ Will Begin At Your Avatar’s High School Cafeteria When He’s Being Tricked Into Joining The Military By A Recruiter,N/A,https://clickhole.com/incredible-realism-the-campaign-in-the-next-call-of-d-1825783221/,"Call Of Duty fans, prepare for the next level in military gaming. Activision has taken its flagship shooter’s legendary immersive gameplay a step further in the franchise’s latest sequel by doing something that’s never been done before: having your avatar start out in his high school cafeteria, where he’s tricked into joining the military by an aggressive recruiter.  Wow. And that, friends, is why Call Of Duty remains the king of the first-person shooters. The new game in the legendary series, Call Of Duty: Black Ops 4, opens with a grittily realistic scene in which your 17-year-old character is walking through his high school cafeteria, where he encounters a charming but pushy military recruiter who offers him a cool camouflage Army T-shirt just for sitting down to chat for five minutes.  The player will get to control their character through the entire interaction with the recruiter, as he subtly manipulates your teenage Call Of Duty persona into committing to the military by characterizing a life in the army as a chance to “get paid to see the world” while conveniently glossing over the true horrors of combat. It’s a truly innovative way to build up your character’s backstory so that it’s all the more exciting when you finally start mowing down enemy soldiers in battle! It really sounds like the folks at Activision have outdone themselves this time and delivered the most authentic virtual warfare in the history of gaming. You’ll even get to control your character’s hand as he puts his signature on the recruiter’s clipboard shortly after he tells you that joining the military is “the adventure of a lifetime” and hands you a poster for the Marines depicting a knight in a suit of armor fighting a dragon in an attempt to characterize war as a type of glorious fairy tale. Basically, if you’re looking for a truly hardcore experience that makes you feel like you’re actually getting the full military experience, Call Of Duty: Black Ops 4 is absolutely essential."
Beer Summit 2.0: President Trump Has Invited The Racist NYC Lawyer And The Woman He Yelled At To The White House So The Lawyer Can Finish Yelling At Her,N/A,https://clickhole.com/beer-summit-2-0-president-trump-has-invited-the-racist-1826205709/,"The shocking video footage of the bigoted New York City attorney Aaron Schlossberg threatening to call ICE on a deli employee simply for speaking Spanish outraged the nation last week. Today, the Trump administration is taking a huge step forward in addressing this racially motivated incident with a spiritual successor to President Obama’s 2009 “beer summit” which opened a dialogue between black professor Henry Louis Gates and a white cop: President Trump has invited the racist NYC lawyer and the woman he yelled at to the White House so the lawyer can finish yelling at her. Amazing. This is a huge gesture from Donald Trump that shows his administration is committed to fostering unity among the American people. Early Monday morning, the White House sent out official invitations to both Aaron Schlossberg and the Hispanic Fresh Kitchen employee who Schlossberg wanted “kicked out” of the country, to come together in the courtyard of the White House Rose Garden so Schlossberg can pick up his tirade right where he left off. According to reports, Donald Trump’s role in the mediation will be to ensure that Schlossberg is not interrupted by the Hispanic woman while he is spewing his vitriol at her, and to suggest anti-immigrant epithets in order to keep the one-sided rant going. “President Trump felt that Mr. Schlossberg was unable to fully communicate his feelings about how everyone who speaks Spanish is an immigrant leech on society,” said a White House representative on the meeting’s conception. “By extending an invitation to both parties to meet over a beer, the president hopes to give Mr. Schlossberg the opportunity to continue hurling racist generalizations without it turning into a viral video, causing thousands of people to get mad at him just for expressing his bigoted views at a woman who was doing her job.” Wow. Talk about facilitating a productive dialogue! Pending RSVPs from both sides, the meeting is set to take place this Friday afternoon. Hopefully, with this summit as a starting point, the nation can finally start to come together and work through the issues that divide us. No matter what you think of the president, you have to admit this is pretty special."
"Bad News For The #Resistance: Sources Close To Mueller Are Suggesting The Pee Tape Is Real, But It Is Hot As Hell, Maybe The Sexiest Event Ever Caught On Camera",N/A,https://clickhole.com/bad-news-for-the-resistance-sources-close-to-mueller-1826194497/,"For those holding out hope that the infamous pee tape will eventually surface and expose President Trump for the depraved monster he truly is, sadly it’s now looking like, if anything, the video will only make him more popular than ever: According to new intel from sources close to Special Counsel Robert Mueller, the pee tape is indeed real, but it is reportedly hot as hell—perhaps the sexiest event ever caught on camera in human history. Sorry, #Resistance, but it doesn’t look like this one’s going to play out in our favor. Unlike the vile, hateful scene described in the controversial Steele dossier, two anonymous FBI officials have now confirmed that the storied 2013 video of Trump ordering prostitutes to urinate on a bed in the Moscow Ritz-Carlton is actually a breathtaking visual feast of unparalleled erotic beauty, so captivating in its raw sensual power that it can arouse virtually anyone, regardless of sexual orientation. Sources familiar with the footage say that it begins with Trump—shirtless, in white briefs and black dress socks—sitting on the end of a luxurious king-size bed, beckoning forth two stunningly gorgeous blond women and asking them “You hookers got any piss in ya?” as they sidle up next to him, sensually stroking his broad, hairy shoulders. It’s then that things start getting really, really hot. “This is happening at The Ritz, mind you, and the lighting is very flattering, so when the women begin urinating, it’s like heavenly founts spouting from angels, with all this residual mist glittering in the wash of golden light—it aroused me in a way I’ve never been aroused before,” one source revealed, noting that the aesthetics are complimentary even to Trump, whose typically garish spray tan is muted into a healthy, exotic glow, and whose ample stretch-marked paunch redistributes flatteringly as he lies back to delight in the women’s emissions, revealing the hidden, youthful brawn that’s long been entombed in girth. “What they’re doing isn’t quite sex, but something more profound, where you see this old man becoming young again in real time, revitalized beneath the twin arches of holy water spraying out of these prostitutes’ urethras. And there’s this big room-service spread, so you’ve got all these picturesque wedges of cheese and roasted meats, and the women are feeding him grapes in a way that makes it feel like you’re watching a living Caravaggio painting.” “It transcends pornography, really,” he continued. “If this thing ever leaks, people aren’t gonna be able to stop watching it. It’s that hot. No matter where you align politically, you will come away from watching this believing Trump is the greatest president in U.S. history.” Resistors, this news is truly our 9/11. The source also noted that, while Trump does indeed make disparaging remarks about the Obamas as mentioned in the Steele dossier, he bellows them in such a glorious moment of carnal ecstasy that it comes off as a strangely poetic cry of passion, one so hauntingly beautiful that it will make you feel his hatred for Obama swelling in your own heart, or at the very least move you to tears. And while the video ends somewhat unceremoniously, with Trump ejaculating a few gushes of semen into a hand towel and immediately falling asleep face-down on the floor, its astonishing erotic power is said to linger with viewers forever, making all other sex they ever experience feel empty and incomplete. Unfortunately, it sounds like this video is unbelievably hot, and it doesn’t seem like it’s going to end up being the silver bullet we were waiting for. Dear Robert Mueller, our tireless savior, please do NOT release the pee tape. If you love this country as much as we know you do, you must destroy this beautiful display of passion and kink that will cause Americans to associate orgasm with Donald J. Drumpf. Here’s hoping that if the tape ever does leak, the #Resistance won’t succumb to its charms and will only masturbate to it begrudgingly."

Switching Gears: Michelin Guide Has Announced That It’s Tired Of Judging Restaurants And It’s Just Going To Give 3 Stars To Any Restaurant That Does That Liquid-Nitrogen Shit,N/A,https://clickhole.com/switching-gears-michelin-guide-has-announced-that-it-s-1825782214/,"The foodies of the Michelin Guide have been combing meticulously through tens of thousands of restaurants around the world for more than a century, but the gold standard in restaurant ratings is about to undergo a major change: Michelin has announced that it’s tired of judging restaurants and it’s just going to give three stars to anyone who does that liquid-nitrogen shit. Wow, this is a major change for such a historic publication. Under the new criteria for 2018, inspectors have been instructed to go ahead and award the highly coveted three-star rating to any weird-ass restaurant with exposed ductwork and a tattooed chef that dunks a banana in liquid nitrogen then breaks it open with a spoon and there is foie gras inside or whatever. In lieu of sampling a wide variety of dishes over several months, Michelin is allowing inspectors to base their decisions off a quick lap around a restaurant, keeping an eye out for some Penn & Teller magical garbage like lobster balloons or some shit. “We’re sick of eating at the same fucking place five different times,” Rebecca Burr, acting editor of Michelin Guide Great Britain and Ireland, stated during a press conference. “If investment bankers are cool with throwing away 400 bucks at a place that sells those cocktails where you just breathe in crème-de-menthe fog, that’s good enough for us. You serve us a dish named ‘August 1936’ and it’s hamburger in some fucked-up, paste form that you have to brush onto your tongue—congrats, you’re one of the best restaurants in the world.” In an effort to streamline the process even further, Burr ended the conference by inviting restaurants to get their inspections done online by visiting Michelin’s website and emailing a 30-second video of their cooks using a blowtorch on a dessert with the subject line “One of Those Restaurants.” Incredible. As one of the world’s most revered publications, Michelin is bound to change the culinary landscape with their new guidelines. Chefs around the world had better take note if they want to appear in next year’s guide."

In a swoon-worthy moment of chivalry, Prince Harry used all his strength to hold open the pod’s vertically sliding door 2 feet high, just enough room for Meghan Markle to crawl under and into the storage box that will serve as her honeymoon locale until early 2019. Though the inside of the PODS container was completely dark and without any sort of lighting whatsoever, paparazzi photos managed to capture images of rose petals scattered across an assortment of lawn equipment and old, plastic-covered furniture inside the container—ooh la la! As if it weren’t obvious enough, this pretty much confirms that Meghan Markle is living out the dreams of every little girl in the world who wants their very own prince to take them in their arms and carry them into a 12-by-8-foot storage unit. Here’s to Prince Harry and Princess Meghan and their new lives together! This concludes ClickHole’s royal wedding coverage.

Queen Elizabeth was seen wiping tears away from her eyes as she pelted the rag-wearing, soot-covered peasants tied to the carriage with rice, proudly bidding wishes of good luck to her grandson and the woman of his dreams. Both newlyweds were seen leaning out the window of the vehicle and blowing kisses back at their loved ones just as they turned a corner, causing several of the commoners tied to the back to get dragged directly into a mailbox before being yanked forward and onward, leaving long streaks of blood on the road.

The send-off for the newest royal couple and the conclusion of the 23rd Winter Olympics was appropriately grand, with the Kensington newlyweds walking hand in hand down the steps of Windsor Castle surrounded by two ice-dancing judges and an alternate for the Slovenian luge team in a beautiful gesture of sportsmanship, unity, and joy for Prince Harry and Princess Meghan tying the knot. We won’t soon forget the amazing heroics of Chloe Kim and the U.S. women’s hockey team, but the magical ceremony of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle in England is quite a way to officially end the festivities in Pyeongchang.

Foremost among the eunuchs is his highness Prince Philip, who, as you’ll recall, bestowed his sovereign testicles unto Prince William at his 2011 wedding to Kate Middleton. As moving as that gesture was, it can’t top this present spectacle of hundreds of genital-less men standing grinning and wide-eyed beneath the majestic arches of St. George’s Chapel, their ladylike voices all declaring “It is I!” in perfect unison.

Most people are still loudly cracking their peanuts open and chucking them on the floor of St. George’s Chapel as if he hadn’t said anything at all, and Queen Elizabeth has even picked up a couple of the shells and started chewing on them to suck out all the salt. It seems like the officiant is giving up pretty quickly on getting the guests to listen, because he just quietly sighed and resumed the prayer in honor of Princess Diana that he had interrupted to address the peanut shells and to reprimand the Duke of Kent who just got out of his seat to put “Jumpin’ Jack Flash” on the chapel jukebox. Here’s hoping that the guests start showing a little more respect during the rest of the ceremony. Stay tuned to ClickHole for more up-to-the-second coverage of the royal nuptials!"

Originally crafted by the royal jeweler in 1841 for Queen Victoria, the NuvaRing incorporates historic gemstones from generations of European royals, and is credited with preventing the births of hundreds of would-be inbred flipper children. It was personally cherished by Queen Elizabeth II, who admired it enough to have it implanted prior to her honeymoon to make sure she and Phillip could fuck like animals without worrying about getting pregnant.

Rough Start To The Royal Wedding: The Officiant Just Introduced Meghan Markle As ‘Michael Morgle’,N/A,https://clickhole.com/rough-start-to-the-royal-wedding-the-officiant-just-in-1826053485/,"It’s hard to imagine a more high-pressure situation than officiating a royal wedding that hundreds of millions of people are watching, and that pressure is clearly getting to officiant Justin Welby, who in his opening address just introduced bride Meghan Markle as “Michael Morgle.” After announcing the groom, Prince Henry of Wales, with no issue, Welby briefly paused and appeared to draw a blank before suddenly blurting out the botched pronunciation of Markle’s name at a deafeningly loud volume. Although Markle seemed to take the flub in good stride, there was a visible twinge of annoyance in her face moments later when Welby proceeded to describe her as the “daughter of Torgle Morgle and Dorgiss Ragtard.” As the archbishop of Canterbury, Welby is certainly no stranger to officiating weddings, so here’s hoping he’s able to find his groove soon and avoid any further phonetic butchering of the bride’s name.

"The Royal Tortoise Who’s Been Carrying Brides To The Altar For The Past 400 Years Is Taking, Like, Half An Hour To Get Meghan Markle Down The Aisle",N/A,https://clickhole.com/the-royal-tortoise-who-s-been-carrying-brides-to-the-al-1826053594/,"Unfortunately, the ceremony is now running considerably behind schedule, as the regal tortoise who’s been carrying brides to the altar at royal weddings for the past 400 years is taking, like, half an hour to get Meghan Markle down the aisle. Despite having entered with the bride through the church’s narthex over 28 minutes ago, the flower-adorned tortoise, named The Magnificent Geoffrey, has only made about 15 feet of progress down the roughly hundred-foot aisle, and he is breathing very heavily. It is clear that The Magnificent Geoffrey no longer possesses the same vigor as he did when he carried Charles I’s bride down the aisle at his first royal wedding back in 1625, as he is basically now dragging his hind legs on the ground behind him, pulling himself forward inch by excruciating inch while Lady Markle stands patiently atop his scab-covered carapace, smiling and waving at guests. In an effort to hasten the proceedings, young Prince George is currently attempting to lure the ancient fellow forward with a trail of pepperonis, but with eyes rendered all but useless by thick yellowy cataracts, the pitiful beast has not yet detected the treats and is continuing forth at his own glacial pace. Making matters worse, the venerable reptile has voided his bowels at numerous junctures during the procession, sullying the train of Lady Markle’s white gown and clouding the great chapel with a nauseating odor. At his current clip, the tortoise will not reach the altar until after sundown.  Stay tuned to ClickHole for more up-to-the-second coverage of the royal nuptials! "

So far, the man has screamed at every wedding guest to enter except for Prince Philip and David Beckham, which has only cast more mystery into whether or not this is just a guy who wandered in to yell at people or is fulfilling some sort of role laid out in the Magna Carta. He’s wearing a tuxedo, which makes it seem like maybe he’s a sanctioned part of the wedding, but he’s also barefoot, which makes it seem like maybe he’s not. He switched to “Aloha, dipshit!” when Meghan Markle entered in her gown, which could potentially signal the end of some kind of royal rite? It’s not evident if this man is conducting part of the ceremony or should be immediately removed, but either way, the wedding has been absolutely beautiful!

CALLING ALL RESISTANCE MEMBERS! We Must Protect Heroic Ex-Russian Whistleblower YAKOV SMIRNOFF Who Is EXPOSING The DISGUSTING HORRORS Of Daily Life In EVIL RUSSIA,N/A,https://clickhole.com/calling-all-resistance-members-we-must-protect-heroic-1826106025/,"We already knew Russia was pure evil after it helped the Colluder-In-Chief (Commander-In-Cheeto) (Mr. Peanut) (Drumpf) steal the election from HRC even though SHE wanted to be president. But thanks to the heroic actions of ex-Russian whistleblower Yakov Smirnoff, who is bravely risking his life to get the word out about the horrors of daily life in Russia, we now have an even better understanding of just how rotten Putin’s evil empire really is, and it’s absolutely bone-chilling. Members of the Resistance, this is an urgent message you must share with everyone you know: Keep Resistance hero Yakov Smirnoff safe AT ALL COSTS so he can continue his noble and vital work of exposing the sinister secrets of life in Soviet Russia! Since escaping Russia and defecting to the U.S., Smirnoff has put his life on the line as a heroic whistleblower, speaking night after night to audiences all across America to spread the word about how in America you watch Big Brother, but in Soviet Russia Big Brother watches you. Even though he knows full well that speaking out puts a target on his back, Smirnoff has refused to remain silent on how in America you assassinate presidents, but in Soviet Russia, presidents assassinate you. The heroism of this brave ex-Russian whistleblower knows no bounds. Just think of how mad Trump’s BFF Putin must have gotten when he found out that Smirnoff had bravely exposed the terrifying truth about how in America you can always find a party, but in Soviet Russia the party can always find you. This is why Yakov Smirnoff is exactly the kind of fearless leader the Resistance—and the country!—needs to fight against the Russian scourge coming to destroy our country, and we must do whatever we can to protect him from Kremlin thugs! Smirnoff’s first-hand account of the backwards barbarities of Russian life is made all the more bone-chilling by how relevant it is to our crumbling democracy. Just think: If we don’t heed Smirnoff’s urgent warning, we may find ourselves living in a world where we don’t mash potato, potato mashes us. Mr. Smirnoff, you’ve saved America. Now it’s time for America to save you. #Resist!"
Balance Of Zero: An Oil Tanker In Alaska Crashed But It Hit A Ship Carrying Dawn Soap So All Of The Wildlife Is Pretty Clean,N/A,https://clickhole.com/balance-of-zero-an-oil-tanker-in-alaska-crashed-but-it-1826105268/,"A massive environmental catastrophe almost devastated the coast of Alaska today when a tanker carrying 11 million gallons of oil collided with another ship in the Cook Inlet. The ensuing oil spill seemed like it was going to decimate local wildlife populations, but luck intervened: The ship the tanker crashed into was carrying 11 million gallons of Dawn dish soap, and the two spills basically canceled each other out. Wow. It’s incredibly fortunate that the oil tanker ruptured the hull of a tanker hauling Dawn soap, because that oil could have been really bad for animals otherwise. Witnesses say that the coastline was covered in thick, gooey black crude oil for a few seconds before the mess was dispersed by a lemony-fresh wave of Dawn soap that left the shore as clean as it had been before. Sea otters, eagles, and other creatures that had been momentarily flopping in the muck and gasping for air stood up perfectly fine, shaking the sudsy water off their bodies, and continued on with their day like nothing had happened. Experts have pointed out that without the corresponding Dawn spill, the oil would have devastated the region for a decade, and likewise without the oil, a spill of only Dawn soap would have similarly destroyed flora and fauna for years, so it’s incredibly good luck the two massive ships happened to run into each other. Thankfully, this potentially catastrophic incident had absolutely zero impact on nature, but this is a wake-up call that oil tankers may collide with things but might not always hit a barge full of Dawn soap. Perhaps our lawmakers should enact laws to ensure that ships that carry oil also have to carry the same amount of Dawn soap onboard in a 50-50 ratio, so spills always solve themselves. That way all oil spills can be as completely inconsequential for wildlife as this one was."
"Sad News, Brits: The Royal Wedding Has Been Delayed Three Months To Give The Band More Time To Learn ‘Livin’ On A Prayer’",N/A,https://clickhole.com/sad-news-brits-the-royal-wedding-has-been-delayed-thr-1826081670/,"Sadly, it looks like we’re all going to have to wait a while longer to watch Prince Harry wed Meghan Markle. The royal family announced this morning that the ceremony planned for this weekend will be postponed for at least three months to give the wedding band more time to learn how to play Bon Jovi’s “Livin’ On A Prayer.” According to the family’s statement, the band can currently play most of “Livin’ On A Prayer,” but nothing less than a flawless rendition of the song will do for the royal wedding. The band’s singer is currently struggling to hit some of Jon Bon Jovi’s higher vocal notes and the bassist still hasn’t memorized the entire song, so the ceremony planned for this weekend is just going to have to wait until all the kinks are ironed out. It’s definitely a bummer, but you can’t blame the royal family for expecting perfection on such a special day. Here’s hoping the band starts nailing the tune ASAP—we don’t how much longer we can wait for this fairy-tale wedding to finally happen!"
Racial Profiling Epidemic: Last Night’s Celtics-Cavs Game Was Briefly Interrupted After A White Person Called The Police Reporting A Large Group Of Black Men Loitering On The Court,N/A,https://clickhole.com/racial-profiling-epidemic-last-night-s-celtics-cavs-ga-1826083084/,"Those who tuned into the Eastern Conference finals Tuesday hoping to see the same top-tier basketball that defined game 1 were likely feeling a bit frustrated last night when, without warning, the contest was suddenly brought to a screeching halt. The highly anticipated game 2 matchup between the Boston Celtics and the Cleveland Cavaliers was delayed for around 20 minutes after a white person called the police reporting a large group of black men loitering on the court. Once again, it seems that simply being black and playing in a nationally televised professional basketball game in America is considered a crime. Just a few minutes into the second half of last night’s game at Boston’s TD Garden, police officers suddenly swarmed the court with guns drawn and screamed at the players to put their hands up, initially refusing to explain why. Police then ordered the entire rosters of both teams—with the exception of white players like Kyle Korver and Aron Baynes—to line up, at which point the men were handcuffed and subjected to pat-downs to see if they were carrying drugs or weapons. Only after forcing players to return to the locker rooms to get their IDs and checking for outstanding warrants did the officers finally reveal why they were there. “On Tuesday at approximately 9:45 pm, officers responded to a woman’s 911 call claiming that a ‘large mob of young, tattooed, physically imposing black men’ was loitering on the TD Garden basketball court and making her feel unsafe,” said Boston Police Commissioner William B. Evans in a statement. “The caller, a white woman, claimed that there were two groups of black men wearing matching colors, and she feared that they were opposing gangs preparing for a violent confrontation. After thoroughly and properly investigating the matter, it was determined that there was no just cause for arrest, and the men, who were all discovered to be professional athletes on the two teams scheduled to play that night at the arena, were given warnings and released with no charges.” “While we regret the misunderstanding,” he continued, “we staunchly defend the officers’ handling of the encounter and maintain that they did what was necessary, within the scope of the law, to keep the fans and players safe.” What last night’s incident really shows is just how far we are from true racial parity in the U.S., and how not even world-famous athletes can feel safe from persecution simply because of the color of their skin. Hopefully this ugly episode will cause people at future sporting events featuring predominately black athletes to put their prejudices aside and just enjoy the game."

Legendary folk artist Paul Simon has announced a Simon & Garfunkel reunion tour after being catfished by someone impersonating Art Garfunkel. This is absolutely devastating. What kind of soulless monster would do this? Simon announced the reunion this morning on his Facebook page, and it’s painfully obvious he’s being duped by someone posing as Art Garfunkel as part of a scam, but Simon is falling for it hook, line, and sinker. This is a complete disaster. Despite hundreds of comments from fans pointing out that the email is clearly BS, Simon has continued to post updates on the reunion tour including dozens of concert bookings and links to purchase tickets. Hopefully Paul will come to his senses before the wire transfer is complete, but even if he manages to get the money back, he’s going to be completely destroyed once he realizes it was all a scam."
Heartbreaking Tragedy: Hundreds Are Dead After The Music Of Kings Of Leon Seduced Dozens Of Sea Captains Into Wrecking Their Ships Against The Staples Center,N/A,https://clickhole.com/heartbreaking-tragedy-hundreds-are-dead-after-the-musi-1825783267/,"What should have been a joyful evening of music and celebration turned tragic last night in one of the deadliest incidents in California history: Hundreds have died after the music of Kings of Leon seduced dozens of sea captains into wrecking their ships against the Staples Center. Heartbreaking. Nothing can prepare you for a disaster like this. At around 8:30 p.m. yesterday evening, Kings of Leon opened their concert with “Sex On Fire,” and the song’s uplifting melody and anthemic chorus bewitched the minds of multiple sea captains sailing their ships in the Pacific, causing them to dash their vessels against the unforgiving walls of the Staples Center. The music mesmerized novice and veteran seamen alike, and the pounding mid-tempo drums mingling with the crackling energy of Caleb Followill’s vocals drew them all toward the multipurpose arena’s perilous concrete architecture like moths to flame. Hundreds of Kings of Leon fans were crushed to death instantly by the massive prows of numerous ocean liners, tugboats, and barges bursting through the stadium walls.  Despite the obvious danger, the bewitched sea captains and their crews lurched unrelentingly toward the sound of the 2008 alternative-rock hit, splintering sailing yachts and fishing boats against the Staples Center in their mindless pursuit of Kings of Leon’s irresistible music. An oil tanker ruptured its hull on the bronze statue of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar in the arena’s Star Plaza, spilling thousands of gallons of crude oil that were then ignited by a speedboat that smashed into Kings of Leon’s tour bus at 90 mph. Even as the fire raged, the captain of the wrecked tanker remained oblivious to everything other than Nathan Followill’s raucous drum fills, tapping his hands on the steering wheel along with the music until he was completely consumed by flame. “It was carnage on a scale I’ve never seen before, and I was forced to choose between saving the lives of the wounded and stopping the unceasing onslaught of enchanted sailors ramming their ships into the Staples Center,” said Jennifer Martens, one of the first paramedics to arrive on the scene. “I wrestled a tugboat captain to the ground just to keep him from running over a downed power line lying between him and a side entrance. His eyes were totally glazed over and his bottom lip was trembling perfectly in rhythm with the bass line of ‘Sex On Fire.’ I tried slapping him awake, but it wasn’t until I plugged his ears up with my fingers that he finally stopped air-guitaring and asked me what he was doing on land.” Possibly the single worst loss of life came from an aircraft carrier whose commanding officer overheard the chorus of “Sex On Fire” and was so transfixed by the unshakeable desire to reach the beguiling music’s source that she cleaved a Carnival cruise liner completely in half, killing 258 passengers instantly and showering the streets below with debris and several fully fueled jets that came loose from the flight deck. The captain managed to disembark and make it within feet of the Staples Center’s main doors before being sideswiped by a jet skier who had also been seized by the otherworldly temptation of Kings of Leon’s soaring guitar riffs, adding two more victims to the already staggering death toll. Eventually, the two-hour concert came to an end and the spell on the sea captains was broken, but sadly, the aftershocks of this calamity will be felt for years to come. Our hearts go out to the people of Los Angeles as they pick up the pieces from this unimaginable tragedy. "
Science FTW: NASA Has Announced That Tonight Is The Night,N/A,https://clickhole.com/science-ftw-nasa-has-announced-that-tonight-is-the-nig-1826008800/,"Pay attention, because you’ll definitely want to catch NASA’s latest report. The space agency has discovered a special occurrence that can be enjoyed by veteran stargazers and newbies alike: NASA has announced that tonight is the night. This is incredibly exciting! NASA just proved yet again that science is the coolest thing in the world. “Based on extensive astronomical observations and calculations, our researchers have determined that tonight is absolutely the night, and that it’s up to us to make it count,” NASA wrote in a statement on its website. “While we originally believed that a night like this wouldn’t occur until we were living through the best days of our lives, recent data suggests that these are the best days of our lives. Right here. Right now. We pinpointed this phenomenon within a range of just a few hours, and we can report definitively that it’s tonight, and it’s up to all of us to make it count.” According to NASA, this magical night will begin just as the final light of sunset starts filtering through the leaves in that breathtaking way that makes you realize you’ll never be younger and more alive than you are right now, and that the phenomenon will continue for as long as you’re willing to hold onto the moment and plunge headlong into the deep and mysterious evening utterly convinced that destiny is what you make it and that this is your time to chase your dreams no matter how crazy they may seem because, damn it, “crazy” is just another word for “beautiful,” and on a night like this every beautiful thing is possible. The agency also says that the prevailing theories of modern astrophysics suggest that this kind of night only happens once in a lifetime, so if you don’t experience it now, then it will completely pass you by. Incredible. Thanks to NASA for making everyone aware of this once-in-a-lifetime event. Tonight is definitely an event you don’t want to miss!"
On His Terms: John McCain Has Reportedly Barred His Viet Cong Torturers From Attending His Funeral,N/A,https://clickhole.com/on-his-terms-john-mccain-has-reportedly-barred-his-vie-1825930316/,"Funerals for public officials are usually attended by a wide gamut of colleagues and dignitaries, but John McCain is making it clear that there will be certain people not allowed to his service after he passes away: According to sources close to McCain, the senator has barred his Viet Cong torturers from attending his funeral. Wow. Senator McCain is clearly determined to leave this world on his own terms. Senator McCain’s request that his torturers not attend his funeral is not totally unexpected as they and the terminally ill senator have long had a rocky relationship from the moment they first shot down then-Lt. Cmdr. McCain’s plane in 1967, dragged him from Trúc Bạch Lake, and beat him unconscious. Their relationship only soured further over the next five and a half years as the Viet Cong prison guards’ near-constant beatings during the Vietnam War left the young McCain permanently unable to raise his arms. So while the senator’s request may ruffle some feathers, it’s easy to follow his logic. Senator McCain’s family has also reported that he will not be accepting any condolences from his Viet Cong prison guards. While some may see Senator McCain’s barring of his Viet Cong torturers from his funeral as needlessly cold, the ailing senator’s request shows that as he enters the final stage of his life, he’s not interested in cozying up to the men who put him in solitary confinement for years at a time for the sake of politeness. Hopefully the reassurance that the torturers who brought McCain to the brink of death will not be attending his funeral will give the senator some peace in this last part of his life."
"Game Over, Trump: An Ancient Order Of Franciscan Monks Has Released A 13th-Century Tapestry Depicting Donald Trump Colluding With Russian Officials",N/A,https://clickhole.com/game-over-trump-an-ancient-order-of-franciscan-monks-1825926817/,"Robert Mueller’s ongoing investigation into collusion between Donald Trump and the Russian government has been inching closer and closer to an indictment, and this bombshell might just be the nail in the coffin for POTUS: An ancient order of Franciscan monks has just released a 13th-century tapestry depicting Donald Trump colluding with Russian officials. Well, Mr. President, the other shoe just dropped. This is not looking good—not good at all. The tapestry, woven by religious artisans during the 13th century and preserved by friars for hundreds of years, depicts Donald Trump shaking hands with Vladimir Putin in a mystical forest, clearly sealing a pact to disenfranchise American voters in 800 years. The two officials are recognizable by their suits and haircuts, and show clear as day that these two have long been bosom buddies, no matter how much they deny it. Take that, Trump: The proof is clear as day. Good luck talking your way out of this one. Since the Order of Friars Minor posted a snapshot of the tapestry on Twitter this morning, liberal pundits have already speculated that it may spell the beginning of the end for the Trump administration. And it looks like they’re right—in addition to the damning illustration of Trump and Putin’s relationship contained in the tapestry, a relief found in the basement of the monastery depicts Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak as a centaur, approaching Trump and Putin holding a bag of coins in his mouth. This is just the kind of evidence we’ve been waiting for since the very beginning of the Russia probe, and we won’t be surprised if Robert Mueller is finally poised to strike. Get out the champagne, because it’s time to finally say (a very happy) goodbye to POTUS 45. Sorry, Donald, but this isn’t the kind of thing you can just throw money at to make it go away. The tapestry these Franciscan friars have revealed is proof positive of shady dealings between Trump and the Russian government—and it’s time for our president to face the consequences."
"Game Over, Drumpf! This Intrepid ‘New York Times’ Reporter Just Has Two Seasons Left Of ‘The Wire’ And Then He’ll Be Free To Blow The Lid Off The Russia Investigation!",N/A,https://clickhole.com/game-over-drumpf-this-intrepid-new-york-times-repor-1825920939/,"Listen up, Drumpf: Enjoy your time in office while it lasts, because journalist Andrés Castilla of the “failing” New York Times is about to become your worst nightmare. This intrepid reporter only has two seasons left of The Wire to get through, and then he’ll be free to blow the lid off the Russia investigation! Game over, Donald J. Chump! Castilla is primed and ready to take down our Commander In Thief and start looking into confirming the Steele dossier just as soon as he finishes reading up on season three of The Wire on the show’s subreddit and subsequently completing the remaining 23 episodes. When he’s eventually put behind bars, President Cheeto is going to spend every waking moment wishing that there had been more seasons of the gripping Baltimore-based crime drama, as this heroic journalist’s in-box is chock-full of unopened emails from a Russian whistleblower that Castilla will eventually have time to read after his attention isn’t totally consumed by being captivated by McNulty’s self-destructive descent into darkness as he chases Marlo through Baltimore’s underbelly. While Castilla may take a brief break at some point to clear his head by watching a more lighthearted program like The Office, he’ll probably only stream a few episodes and then go right back into wrapping up seasons four and five of The Wire, at which point there will be nothing standing in the way of him getting to work on exposing that treasonous orange blob in the White House. Not all journalists are willing to put their lives on the line to speak the truth, but Castilla is fearless, and his reporting will be the reason Drumpf rots in a jail cell someday, though not before deciding to rewatch The Wire a second time to truly appreciate its many complex plotlines. Don’t worry, Mueller—journalists like Castilla have got your back! You’ve got to give Castilla a lot of credit, because he’s not only a tremendous investigative reporter, but he also really wants to get the most out of his experience watching The Wire. Donnie and his cronies better watch out, because once those final credits roll and Castilla’s schedule clears up, he’s going to make Drumpf rue the day he ever colluded with the Russians."
The Struggle Continues: America’s Worst Soldier And ISIS’s Worst Soldier Are Currently Hitting Each Other With Brooms,N/A,https://clickhole.com/the-struggle-continues-america-s-worst-soldier-and-isi-1825918675/,"While ISIS has seen its power and influence decline significantly in the past year since losing control of Mosul, the fight to completely eliminate the terrorist group from its remaining positions in the Middle East is ongoing: As of right now, America’s worst soldier and ISIS’s worst soldier are currently hitting each other with brooms. This is a powerful reminder that while weakened and losing numbers, ISIS is not going away any time soon. Today’s violent skirmish began when the most bird-brained soldier in the U.S. Army and the biggest idiot in ISIS both separated from their platoons, stumbled across each other in the streets of the northern Syrian town of Manbij, and began wildly swinging brooms at each other. After several minutes of chickening out each time they got close enough to actually land a blow, action escalated when the ISIS soldier finally landed a hit on the American’s shin by throwing his broom at him like a frisbee, causing the American to yelp in pain. The two soldiers then began wrestling around on the ground in a fight to gain control of the thrown broom. Once back on their feet, the American soldier shrieked, “Quit it, asshole,” as he swung his broom wildly above his head in an attempt to drive the enemy fighter from the unclaimed territory, but made little progress. The embarrassing combat has continued, with both of the highly useless soldiers trading occasional blows with their brooms while letting out high-pitched shrieks each time the straw bristles of the broom comes into contact with any part of their bodies. So far neither side has yet to cede their position. The American soldier did force a temporary retreat of the enemy by charging at him while spinning his broom around like a bow staff, but he accidentally dropped his broom before he was able to get anywhere close to his target. Since then, the ISIS soldier has been able to counter any further advances by falling onto his back and kicking his legs into the air any time the American soldier approaches. Both soldiers are swatting and slapping at each other as hard as they can, but neither is able to call in reinforcements, as they’re both far from camp and have had their communications privileges revoked by their respective militaries. Wow. This latest battle is a sobering reminder that the United States’ continued struggle to rid the Middle East of the Islamic State may get worse before it gets better. Hopefully, the U.S. comes out on top in this pathetic display of broom-based combat and the world will be one step closer to ridding itself of the terrorist group."
"Take That, Drumpf Lovers! A Research Team At MIT Has Conclusively Proved That Trump = Voldemort",N/A,https://clickhole.com/take-that-drumpf-lovers-a-research-team-at-mit-has-co-1825159269/,"None Hey, MAGA idiots! You can yell all you want about how the media is unfair to Donald Drumpf, but now there is officially a little thing called MATH that empirically proves he is the worst: A research team at MIT has just conclusively proved that Trump = Voldemort. Wow. Let’s see you talk your way out of this one, Trump stans! “The big breakthrough came last fall when we discovered that Stephen Miller = Peter Pettigrew2 and Freedom Caucus = Death Eaters,” research lead Anwar Yadav said in a statement about the groundbreaking study that will have Drumpf fans screaming. “But we got stuck when the proofs suggested that Jared Kushner = Ron Weasley + Hagrid. Luckily a graduate student noticed that there had been a rounding error on Paul Ryan / Luna Lovegood = Snape, and everything snapped into place after that.” Wow. Liberal pundits across the country are already suggesting that this may be the Orange One’s most devastating loss yet, because math is objectively always right. So much for Trump 2020! “These findings have far-reaching implications,” Yadav continued. “Not only do we now have incontrovertible proof that Trump = Voldemort, but we’ve also managed to surmise that Kellyanne Conway = Bellatrix Lestrange and the Democrats = Dumbledore’s Army.”  The Drumpf administration must be seething with rage now that the exhaustive study, which cost $28 million over nine months, has reached this conclusion. Looks like fighting for the Resistance just got a lot easier!"
"Resistance Win! This Artist Was Going To Draw Trump And Putin Kissing, But Was Worried That Seemed Homophobic, So He Had Them Kiss While Thinking About Pamela Anderson",N/A,https://clickhole.com/resistance-win-this-artist-was-going-to-draw-trump-and-1825887102/,"To stop Donald Trump’s insidious agenda, there’s no better weapon than the power of art, and one incredible painting is taking the President Cheeto to task in the best possible way. Michael Ortiz was going to paint a mural of Putin and Trump kissing as a metaphor for the president’s treasonous collusion with Russia, but was worried that might seem homophobic, so he added a thought bubble to show that the two men were thinking about Pamela Anderson as they locked lips. Take that, Drumpf! We’d like to see you bounce back from this! “Showing Trump and Putin kissing was the only way I could think of to convey to the public that these two tyrants have been conspiring with each other to bring down American democracy, but I didn’t want to imply that there was anything funny or shameful about two men kissing,” Ortiz said of his epic mural, which is certain to already have Trump screaming with rage. “If I used a metaphor for collusion other than Trump and Putin kissing, my audience might not understand it, so I just depicted both men thinking about Pamela Anderson while they locked lips, and now it’s clear that they’re heterosexuals.” Absolutely amazing. Thanks to Ortiz’s quick thinking, his totally perfect illustration now portrays a non-sexual conspiracy kiss between a pair of corrupt politicians who both have a heterosexual crush on Pamela Anderson. It’s not in any way an attempt to use their sexual orientation as a punch line, and anyone who sees this image will clearly observe that Trump and Putin are simply kissing because they’re platonic collusion buddies. They can’t possibly be attracted to each other because they are busy thinking of the February 1990 Playboy Playmate of the Month! Awesome. This painting is a huge victory for the resistance, and it’s entirely neutral for gay rights, because in this powerful piece of protest art, Trump and Putin are two heterosexual men who kiss only to show how they’re in league with each other while they daydream about Pamela Anderson. It’s an absolutely flawless takedown of America’s Conman-In-Chief and his Russian co-conspirator, and a total resistance win!"

That’s right, Mr. Trump, my best friend, the clock is ticking, dear sir, and it’s about time. About damn time, if I may use some unseemly language, my good man and esteemed president! First of all, honorable Prince Donald, sir, let me say this: Thank you. No really—you’re welcome, Mr. President, sir, and thank you very much. But just a fair warning, if I may, sir, please: you can’t stop it. You see, if I may interrupt further, my devoted Lord Trump, and quite simply, that’s the bottom line! Every minute, wise Commissioner Donald, my dear, it simply cannot continue. It never will. And when it does, by YOUR own hand, on YOUR watch, decent sir, it will be too late. Can I say that, wise Uncle Trump, sir? Is that ok? I don’t mean to offend—just to tell the truth, doctor. And if you’ll grant me just another paragraph, Mr. President, my treasured son and judicious father, excuse me, sir, but if I could, dear vicar, please, I absolutely have to ask: but then, I guess that wouldn’t be enough, would it?

"Time To Backtrack: Researchers At Berkeley Have Discovered That Feeding A Gallon Of OxiClean To A Pelican Will Cause It To Explode, But Completely Lost Track Of What They Were Initially Researching To Get To That",N/A,https://clickhole.com/time-to-backtrack-researchers-at-berkeley-have-discove-1825859209/,"Any researcher will tell you that scientific questions sometimes lead to unexpected answers. But one group of academics is having trouble remembering what their question was to begin with: Berkeley scientists have discovered that feeding a gallon of OxiClean to a pelican will make it explode, but they totally lost track of what they were initially researching to get to that. Sadly, it looks like this team is going to have to retrace its steps. “After months of rigorous research and experimentation, we now have conclusive evidence that a pelican that consumes more than a gallon of OxiClean will violently explode all over the place, but we can’t quite remember the line of scientific inquiry that led us to that conclusion,” said lead researcher Dr. Vivian Schwartz at a press conference held at the University of California, Berkley earlier today. “We know for sure that we’re all chemists, so maybe we started out trying to research something about the molecular properties of OxiClean? Also we have earlier data from an experiment in which we asked sets of twins to drink a tablespoon of OxiClean and then monitored their sleep patterns, but we really don’t know how that got us to our ultimate conclusion that OxiClean makes pelicans blow up.” “At one point we had funding from the Department of Defense, but we have no recollection why or what they wanted us to do,” Schwartz added. The puzzled researchers also produced laboratory logs revealing that, prior to their final experiment in which they fed a pelican enough OxiClean to make it pop like an oversize water balloon, they had spent several weeks teaching orangutans how to stack bottles of OxiClean into a high tower. However, the scientists could not recall what hypothesis led them to that point, or how they had managed to get from there to publishing a peer-reviewed research paper concluding that pouring OxiClean down a pelican’s throat eventually causes the pelican to burst loudly into a shower of feathers and viscera. Wow. It seems like these scientists aren’t anywhere close to figuring out why the fact that pelicans explode after ingesting a gallon of OxiClean was relevant to their research. Best of luck to them as they try to piece together what they were working on in the first place!"
Abuse Of Power: Donald Trump Just Signed An Executive Order Stating That He Is Allowed To Get Inside John McCain’s Coffin With Him,N/A,https://clickhole.com/abuse-of-power-donald-trump-just-signed-an-executive-o-1825832729/,"If you needed any more proof that President Trump can’t tolerate a personal slight without getting revenge, this story should do the trick: Just a few days after John McCain made it clear he doesn’t want the president attending his funeral, Donald Trump has signed an executive order stating that he is allowed to get inside John McCain’s coffin with him. Wow, this is an unconscionable abuse of power by the president. The order, which the president signed this morning, supersedes McCain’s request that Trump not attend his funeral by granting Trump the power to enter John McCain’s casket with him at any time and for any reason whatsoever, including in the middle of the ailing senator’s funeral. Going way beyond the powers granted to him in the Constitution, the order also specifically grants Trump the ability to get inside the senator’s coffin and lie down while the pallbearers carry it to the gravesite, and to delay the senator’s burial until he is done sitting inside the coffin with him. The disturbing order goes on to detail how Trump’s power continues even after McCain’s burial: If at any point Donald Trump decides to unearth Mr. John McCain’s casket to get inside and take a nap, this executive order overrides any and all existing property and burial rights. It will also be up to Donald Trump’s discretion whether or not John McCain’s body remains inside his coffin should Donald Trump decide to unearth it and climb inside for a picnic or any other personal use. Absolutely horrifying. It’s not hard to see how Trump could even use this executive order as grounds to have McCain’s coffin delivered to the White House so he can sit in it at a future state dinner or press conference. Simply put, that Trump has unilaterally given himself the power to get inside John McCain’s coffin sets a dangerous precedent. Mr. Trump, if you really want to get inside John McCain’s coffin whenever you want, you need to get Congressional approval, because THAT is how democracy works. End of story."
"Check Your Fridge: Perdue Is Recalling 50,000 Chicken Breasts After They Left The Factory Without Getting A Little Kiss Goodbye",N/A,https://clickhole.com/check-your-fridge-perdue-is-recalling-50-000-chicken-b-1825826221/,"If you were planning to cook up some chicken for dinner tonight, you might want to double-check the package after this startling announcement from one of the world’s largest chicken suppliers: Perdue Farms is recalling 50,000 chicken breasts after they left the factory without getting a little kiss goodbye. Yikes. Perdue’s PR team has got their work cut out for them if they’re going to recover from this massive blunder. Perdue issued the recall this morning on all boneless, skinless chicken breasts sold within the past eight days after a plant worker reported to upper management a breakdown in the packaging process that allowed an estimated 50,000 chicken breasts to leave the plant without a line worker first giving each individual piece of chicken meat a sweet little goodbye kiss. In a statement released this morning, the remorseful poultry company provided a mailing address for its processing plant where customers can return any Perdue chicken breasts bought within the recall period so they can be properly embraced before being sent back out for public consumption. “It has come to our attention that over the past week, thousands of Perdue chicken breasts were shipped out to grocery stores nationwide without an employee first picking up the package, telling the chicken breasts, ‘Goodbye, you are loved,’ and giving them a little kiss,” Perdue Farms CEO Randy Day said in the statement. “We are issuing an immediate recall on any Perdue chicken breasts bought within the past eight days so we can have a chance to kiss them goodbye and wave tearfully as the delivery truck pulls away from the factory. We also strongly urge members of the public not to attempt to kiss the chicken themselves, since that just won’t have the same emotional significance.” Perdue’s statement goes on to assure customers that the company’s quality-control team is now taking every measure necessary to ensure that no additional customers are sold chicken breasts that were treated so coldly and callously so as to not receive their special kiss goodbye. Company officials are also urging customers not to eat any of the unkissed chicken breasts under any circumstances because then the chicken breasts would have come into this world and left it without ever knowing it was truly loved. Oof. Well it sounds like Perdue Farms knows it messed up royally, but only time will tell if it’s able to right the ship after this epic screwup!"
Just Sad At This Point: Timotheé Chalamet Still Has No Idea That His Fame Is Just A Cruel Joke Everyone Decided To Play On Him Because We All Think He’s A Giant Loser,N/A,https://clickhole.com/just-sad-at-this-point-timothee-chalamet-still-has-no-1825756863/,"Sometimes a prank goes on for so long that it straight-up gets sad, and this one is a prime example: Somehow, after a year-plus of gaslighting this dude a cartoonish amount, Timotheé Chalamet still has no idea that his fame is a big joke everyone’s playing on him because we all think he’s a massive jackass and wanted to watch him eat it so hard.  Unbelievable. It’d honestly be hard for everyone to make it any more obvious that his fame is a sham, and the poor dipshit still has no idea. As Timotheé’s “career” has “taken off” over the last year, it’s felt like any moment could be the one when that toothy nerd realizes that everyone’s just been fucking with him the whole time, which makes it that much crazier that it still hasn’t happened. Even in the beginning, when director Luca Guadagnino cast him in Call Me By Your Name just to get that vacant-eyed clown to fuck a peach so he’d look like a lunatic, it felt like Timotheé would see what they were doing right away and immediately get all pissed. But nope, the dude 100% went all-out fucking a peach and believed everyone when we all said we liked it. We all had a good laugh at this idiot virgin boning a fruit, but it started to get a little sad when the Academy decided to double down and nominate him for a Best Actor Oscar, and he earnestly brought his mom to the ceremony. Jane Fonda and Helen Mirren could barely keep a straight face when they said his name as a nominee, but still the doofus was smiling in the front row like he isn’t just the butt of a massive joke that everyone is in on but him. Honestly, it almost seemed like maybe he had figured it out and was just fucking with us in revenge, but then he totally bought that Kid Cudi would tweet at him about how much he respects him, and it was obvious this sad sack didn’t have any idea that everyone thinks he’s a giant fucking dork. “It really is insane that this mouth-breathing shit-for-brains still doesn’t know his fame is a massive setup,” Call Me By Your Name costar Armie Hammer said about Timotheé’s practical joke of a career. “There were definitely times on set where I’d wonder if we were being too obvious or mean, but then Tim would leave the room and we’d all start laughing so hard. The idea that Timotheé genuinely thinks he’s crushing it was really funny, but it’s getting pretty old now.” So crazy. As the escalations keep getting bigger and bigger, it’s getting that much harder to believe that the joke is somehow still going. A-listers like Jennifer Lawrence are coming out of the woodwork and saying they want to marry him. Celebs are sticking him in Coachella pictures with megastars like Nicki Minaj and the Weeknd as if he’s their peer. Tim, is this really what you thought your dumb little life would be like? It was fun for a while to laugh at a dog-shit actor running around Hollywood thinking he was some big rising star, but maybe someone should just tell him so we can all move on at this point. "
Flying Safety FTW! American Airlines Will Be Placing A Weapon Under The Seat Of Each Passenger To Be Used In The Event Of An All-Out Battle Royale,N/A,https://clickhole.com/flying-safety-ftw-american-airlines-will-be-placing-a-1825822743/,"For many people, flying in an airplane can be pretty scary, but American Airlines is introducing a brand-new feature that is sure to make its customers feel totally secure: American will be placing a weapon under the seat of each passenger to be used in the event of an all-out battle royale!  Awesome! Sounds like this major airline is really stepping things up to keep its customers safe!

Wow. Safety FTW! It’s truly amazing to see a company like American making big changes for the sake of its customers.

Deeply Troubling: Garry Kasparov Has Tested Positive For CTE After Years Of Using His Head To Hit The Chess Clock,N/A,https://clickhole.com/deeply-troubling-garry-kasparov-has-tested-positive-fo-1825460237/,"One of the greatest chess players of all time just received some devastating news that could have profound ramifications on the game for years to come: Former chess world champion and Grandmaster Garry Kasparov has been diagnosed with chronic traumatic encephalopathy after a lifetime of using his head to hit the chess clock during matches. In a heartbreaking statement announcing the news, the Kasparov family disclosed that after months of behaving erratically, Garry finally agreed to visit a neurologist, who would end up delivering the diagnosis that the family feared most. CAT scans of Garry’s brain indicated that, as a result of him using his dome to head-butt the chess clock after every move he’d made from childhood all the way through to the leisurely matches of retirement, the chess legend had sustained the degenerative brain disease that currently has no cure. “Looking at the brain scans, it’s clear to see just how much irreparable damage Garry has done after years of subjecting his skull to intensive impact between every chess move he made,” commented UCLA neurologist Mary Jimenez. “Smashing your face into the chess clock as hard as you can just once can cause lasting brain injury, and Garry was doing this dozens of times for every match for decades. The human brain was simply not designed to sustain the kind of repeated blunt impact inherent in the career of a chess Grandmaster, and as a result, Garry Kasparov’s CTE is very advanced.” In retrospect, there were major red flags that Kasparov’s habit of slamming his head as hard as he could after every move was taking a toll on his body and mind. Everyone remembers the 1985 championship match against defending champion Anatoly Karpov when Garry rammed his face into the chess clock so hard that he lost consciousness and lay facedown, motionless on the table for a full three minutes before he regained consciousness. This should have been a major red flag, but instead of calling off the match to give Kasparov medical attention, officials simply let him keep playing as if nothing had happened, and he continued to use his head to hit the chess clock an additional 26 times before the end of the game. At the time, Garry was celebrated for his grit and determination, but now it’s clear that his willingness to keep playing chess through concussive vomiting spells and complete loss of bowel control has finally destroyed his health. Absolutely heartbreaking. The worst part of this devastating news is that Kasparov’s CTE diagnosis has deeply troubling implications for the current generations of chess players, who have spent their lives trying to emulate Garry’s legendary career by using their skulls to hit their clocks as hard as they can after every move. These younger players may end up grappling with the same debilitating disease that currently plagues their hero, unless the chess world takes steps to address their sport’s culture of wanton head-slamming sometime soon."
The Future Of Journalism: ‘The New York Times’ Is Trying To Win Over A Younger Audience By Having Paul Krugman Livestream Solitaire On Twitch While Discussing Trade Regulations,N/A,https://clickhole.com/the-future-of-journalism-the-new-york-times-is-tryin-1825164317/,"America’s most iconic newspaper just made a major editorial change in an effort to survive in today’s rapidly changing media landscape. In an effort to expand its subscriber base, The New York Times is attempting to win over teens and millennials by having columnist Paul Krugman livestream solitaire on Twitch while discussing trade regulations. Wow, it looks like we can’t dismiss The New York Times as the outdated “Old Gray Lady” just yet! Tens of millions of young people already flock to Twitch to watch streams of video gamers like Fortnite and Overwatch, and The New York Times is betting that while they’re there, they’ll also be interested in watching solitaire while getting a lecture on macroeconomic theory from Paul Krugman. Every weekday the Nobel prize–winning economist will spend eight hours playing Windows solitaire before a live web audience, while simultaneously discussing the latest news in U.S. trade policy. “Hey, gamers, get ready to watch Paul Krugman break down complex topics like tariffs, NAFTA, and currency inflation while he skillfully draws virtual playing cards and tries to arrange them by suit!” the Times editorial board wrote in a front-page statement announcing the economist’s new Twitch channel. “The New York Times is looking forward to working and growing with Mr. Krugman as he serves up all the fresh, hot card-flipping action that gamers crave alongside the incisive economic analysis that Times readers expect.” While Krugman streams his solitaire marathons on the verified Twitch channel “New York Times_Official,” viewers are welcome to join the live chat and ask the op-ed writer questions like what his favorite playing cards are, or how America should correct its trade deficit with China. It’s a cool way for The New York Times to connect with a whole new generation. It seems like Paul Krugman has fully embraced his new role as a Twitch personality. During his first solitaire livestream, Krugman immediately coined the catchphrase “Nice. I drew an ace,” which he’s started saying whenever he draws an ace. Although Krugman is only playing solitaire at the moment, the Times said in the future he may play PVP games like go fish or checkers against special guest opponents such as Times columnists Nicholas Kristof or Maureen Dowd, while they debate issues like the efficiency of tax cuts to stimulate the economy. It promises to keep his Twitch channel exciting for years to come, ensuring the long-term financial stability of The New York Times. With Krugman’s Twitch stream, the paper of record has proven it’s able to adapt and evolve to keep reporting for years to come. When you see Paul Krugman hunched over a desktop computer, dragging a ten of spades onto a jack of hearts while discussing foreign quotas on steel exports, you can tell you’re looking at the future of journalism."
Damning Reveal: Trump’s Former Doctor Has Admitted That The President Ghostwrote His Glowing Account Of Adventuring Through Trump’s Body In A Microscopic Submarine,N/A,https://clickhole.com/damning-reveal-trump-s-former-doctor-has-admitted-that-1825754846/,"Throughout the 2016 presidential election, Donald Trump routinely touted his excellent physical health as a reason for why he was more fit for office than his opponent, Hillary Clinton. However, it now appears that Trump’s lofty claims about his superior health might just be yet another fabrication, as the president’s former doctor has admitted that his glowing account of adventuring through Trump’s body in a microscopic submarine was 100 percent ghostwritten by Trump himself. Wow. The lies from Trumpland just keep on coming. In a 2015 letter that boasted about everything from “highly intelligent brain cells that resemble miniature Albert Einsteins” to “strong white blood cells that constantly imperiled the submarine,” Trump’s longtime personal doctor Harold Bornstein dismissed any concerns about the then-presidential candidate’s wellness by describing an “exhilarating odyssey” he had taken in a shrunken-down submersible through the GOP nominee’s “astonishingly healthy” anatomy. However, Bornstein has now revealed that his vivid descriptions of piloting around the president’s “immaculately clean and unobstructed bloodstream” were dictated word for word by Trump, whose body, he now admits, has never actually been inspected by a physician in an incredibly tiny watercraft. “I’m ashamed to confess that, in a momentary lapse of professional judgment, I allowed Mr. Trump to use my letterhead to make false claims about a fantastical voyage through his organs and bodily systems, and for that I am deeply sorry,” Bornstein admitted in a statement. “It was Trump, not me, who wrote about leaving the microscopic submarine to use a partially digested carrot to surf a powerful swell of stomach acid, and it was Trump who described emerging squeaky clean through his kidneys as if having gone through a carwash. And though I was widely quoted in the media as saying I had merrily jumped up and down on Trump’s remarkably powerful lung sacs like a moon bounce, I regret to say that this, too, is wholly untrue.” These damning revelations raise new concerns about Trump, who, as the oldest person ever to be elected to a first-term presidency, is at a heightened risk for a myriad of serious ailments—especially if his body is not, as claimed in his letter, “chock-full of muscular sword-wielding white blood cells that slay ugly green bacteria monsters like Spartans charging into battle.” And with his noted lack of exercise, it’s now reasonable to doubt whether his cardiovascular system is even strong enough to sneeze out a shrunken doctor and submarine just seconds before the miniaturization effect wore off and they returned to normal size as the letter describes. For a man who routinely touted his physical superiority to his opponent over the course of his presidential candidacy, it is deeply troubling to discover that Trump has once again misled the public about who he really is. And while the White House has yet to formally respond to these unsettling new allegations, here’s hoping Trump will do the right thing and allow an impartial physician to take a clinical submarine journey through his body and provide the American people with an honest, undistorted medical assessment so we can be sure he is physically fit to serve."
Diplomatic Snafu: North Korea Is Letting Trump Choose If He Wants Three American Hostages Returned Or A Mysterious Box That Could Have Anything Inside It,N/A,https://clickhole.com/diplomatic-snafu-north-korea-is-letting-trump-choose-i-1825753005/,"As if diplomatic relations between the United States and North Korea couldn’t get any more complicated, today’s new wrinkle comes along and adds a whole new complexity to the equation: Kim Jong-un is letting President Trump choose between the return of three American hostages or a mysterious box that could have anything inside it. In a situation with no simple answers, this obstacle is only making matters that much more difficult. Amid negotiations between the U.S. State Department and high-level North Korean officials, representatives of Kim Jong-un presented President Trump with two options: the safe return of three imprisoned American citizens, or a large wooden crate marked with several question marks on each side. What was looking like an easy diplomatic victory for Trump has become one of the most complicated dilemmas of his presidency yet, his mind surely weighing the pros and cons of freeing these political prisoners or taking a bold risk on the box, which could contain anything from a priceless treasure to a heap of packing peanuts and nothing else. North Korean authorities denied Trump’s request to put his ear to the box or shake it around to get a hint of what was inside, meaning Trump will only have his gut instinct to rely on in making this decision. In a way, Trump is damned if he does take the box, and also damned if he doesn’t and it’s revealed afterward that the box had four American hostages in it instead of just three. Suffice it to say, America’s North Korean quandary has officially gotten much, much deeper. Only time will tell whether Trump opts for the safe route of freeing three Americans or gives in to the alluring temptation of the mystery box. If he chooses wrong, the consequences may be drastic enough to reshape the geopolitical landscape."
"A New Beginning: After Formally Ending Their 65-Year War, North And South Korea Have Teamed Up To Invade Italy",N/A,https://clickhole.com/a-new-beginning-after-formally-ending-their-65-year-wa-1825744977/,"Since 1950, the Korean peninsula has been torn apart by war, with the threat of violent conflict constantly looming on both sides of the demilitarized zone. But now, North and South Korea have finally decided to put their differences aside, and the two countries are already taking massive strides to build a new and lasting diplomatic relationship: After formally ending their 65-year war, North and South Korea have teamed up to invade Italy. So powerful. It looks like peace has come to the Korean Peninsula at last. Following a meeting at the 38th parallel north, where leaders of each country agreed to a peace treaty, North Korean Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in joined hands to announce that the militaries of both Korean nations were currently marching across the Alps and determined to conquer Italy one region at a time. The strength of this newfound partnership is undeniable, with the typically adversarial Kim Jong-un claiming that Italy’s land has always belonged to the Korean people, and that his armed forces will proudly march alongside South Korea’s in harmony until every inch of Italy, from the snow-capped mountains of northern Piedmont to the serene cliff-side vistas of the southern Amalfi Coast, had become designated as Korean territory. In a moving gesture of friendship, Moon Jae-in then smiled at Kim Jong-un before announcing that the years of violence between their two nations were officially over, and together North and South Korea would support one another as they slaughtered any Italian freedom fighters who opposed them. “My friend, I cannot wait until we are standing arm in arm, watching our soldiers raise the flags of our two noble nations high above the newly founded Korean Republic of Italy,” President Moon said with tears in his eyes. The two men then embraced as a large television screen behind them began to play live footage of North and South Korean soldiers driving tanks through the streets of Venice. Absolutely beautiful. For two countries that have been at odds for more than half a century, it can’t be overstated just how amazing it is to see them act as one team to plunder Italy and claim its people and resources as their own. It just goes to show that when warring nations work together instead of against each other, anything is possible."
Goodbye Tinder: Facebook’s New Dating App Finally Allows You To Romantically Connect With Your Dad’s Friend Who Likes All Your Posts Even Though You’ve Never Met Him,N/A,https://clickhole.com/goodbye-tinder-facebook-s-new-dating-app-finally-allow-1825725338/,"Online dating can be a serious headache, and it’s more likely you’ll find yourself stuck in an endless cycle of dead-end first dates than in a compatible match. But if you’re experiencing dating app fatigue, don’t lose hope of finding that special someone just yet, because Facebook just announced a brand-new dating feature that will finally allow you to romantically connect with your dad’s friend who likes all of your posts even though you’ve never met him. Adios, Tinder! Looks like Facebook is about to take the online dating game to a whole new level. Unveiled yesterday at Facebook’s annual F8 developer conference, the social media platform’s incredible new opt-in dating feature will finally give users what has until now never existed in a matchmaking service: the opportunity to enter an intimate relationship with that guy named Wayne or Randy who was friends with your dad growing up and now seemingly spends all his time on Facebook liking vacation photos of strangers three decades his junior and blindly sharing all the sassy Tweety Bird memes and unsourced news articles about product recalls that come across his newsfeed. With comparatively miniscule subscriber pools, apps like Tinder and Hinge have never been able to adequately serve those who wish to send flirty messages to 62-year-old strangers with improperly uploaded profile pictures of themselves posing next to Corvettes, but Facebook, with more than two billion active users, is readily equipped to facilitate romantic trysts between eager young singles and retired truck drivers who used to drop cherry bombs down toilets with your dad and now constantly use the internet to share typo-riddled posts about how the world was much better before the internet. “Facebook has the capacity to connect people better than any other product in the history of the world, and today we’re proud to announce an extraordinary new dating service that will empower our users to find lasting love with grizzled old baby boomers who you’ve never met but who will often leave unprovoked comments on your 10-year-old vacation photos at two in the morning saying things like, ‘wow looks fun beautiful family rick,’ or simply just typing their own name for some reason,” announced Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg during a keynote address. “Not only will our feature be able to do everything that existing dating apps do, but it will also grant users access to a whole new world of retirement-age weirdos with Snoopy profile photo frames who are single and ready to mingle.” The Facebook dating app, set to be released later this year, boasts a bevy of proprietary matchmaking tools that don’t exist on any other mobile-focused dating services, including a filter that detects appreciation for things like the Doobie Brothers and Bob Evans early-bird specials, to ensure that users aren’t just being paired with like-minded individuals from their own age group but also belligerently conservative Vietnam vets with penchants for wishing friends happy birthday in stand-alone posts because they don’t realize they can share directly to someone’s wall. Although Facebook has suffered significant damage to its reputation over the past year, a successful rollout of a dating app that effectively pairs users with lurking old men from their father’s boyhood could be just what the company needs to atone for its missteps and restore its credibility to the public at large. If you’re tired of being disappointed over and over by the same old dating apps, then this new Facebook service might be just what you need to make you believe in love again. Here’s hoping Facebook launches the new app soon so that you can get your dad’s old friends out of the comments of your profile photos and into your dating life!"

Tough Times For Digital Media: Budget Cuts Have Forced ClickHole To Close Our Children’s Cancer Research Center,N/A,https://clickhole.com/tough-times-for-digital-media-budget-cuts-have-forced-1825687683/,"Like every other digital publisher, ClickHole is facing the challenges of a volatile industry. Online media is contending with low traffic and lower ad revenue, and the business reality is that publishers need to cut costs. That’s why, after exhausting every possible option, we’ve made the very difficult decision to shutter the ClickHole Pediatric Cancer Research Center. This choice was not easy. It was the result of a careful and thorough evaluation, which found that an operational change in our sprawling medical campus was financially necessary to ensure that we are still able to bring you the best personality quizzes, heartwarming videos, and the most shareable listicles. Profits are dropping across the digital media landscape, and circumstances forced us to choose between our cutting-edge pediatric cancer center that saves thousands of children’s lives a year and continuing our popular website that showcases the freshest memes and the finest in viral content. It was the hardest call we’ve ever had to make as a company, but we ultimately decided that the website was more important to society. The vote was unanimous. We thought that selling branded T-shirts and mugs might raise enough money to justify continuing pediatric clinical trials, but unfortunately, merchandise sales weren’t where they needed to be to finance our in-depth cancer research that brought hope to families every day. Please know that our core purpose remains unchanged, and that we will continue bringing you every ounce of viral content that we can dredge up from the internet each day. When we first opened our six-story, state-of-the-art cancer research center, the media industry was completely different. Traffic to our homepage was much higher, Facebook was promoting our content instead of burying it, and our dedicated team of pediatric oncologists had full funding for their leukemia studies. Since then, the monetary realities that we face as a publisher have changed, and our organization needed to make cuts. To our departing medical staff, we are truly grateful for the hard work and talent you brought to the ClickHole Pediatric Cancer Research Center. To the small group of world-class oncologists that were reassigned to our editorial team to aggregate viral content, welcome. And to the pediatric patients who were halfway through clinical trials, we hope that the OMG-worthy content ClickHole.com serves up every day brings a smile to your face in whatever facility you’re in now. It brings us no joy to make this announcement, but it’s a necessary step to growing and adapting as a digital publisher. We encourage our readers to take solace in the fact that we will continue to publish celebrity gossip and viral videos with passion and diligence. Although the realities of media have forced us to shut down our children’s cancer research center, our commitment to capitalize on highly clickable internet content is stronger than ever."
"Actions Have Consequences: In Light Of Her Controversial Remarks, 3 Of The 9 Portraits Of Michelle Wolf Have Been Removed From The Oval Office",N/A,https://clickhole.com/actions-have-consequences-in-light-of-her-controversia-1825662370/,"Over the weekend, Michelle Wolf sparked outrage for her audacious speech at the White House Correspondents’ Dinner, which brutally roasted several prominent members of the Trump administration. Now, the White House is responding to the situation in a major way: In light of her controversial remarks, three of the nine portraits of Michelle Wolf have officially been removed from the Oval Office. Wow. This gesture sends a strong message that the White House will not tolerate bullying from liberal personalities like Wolf. As of this morning, White House maintenance workers could be seen taking down three of the nine portraits of Michelle Wolf that had been displayed prominently in the Oval Office ever since Trump’s first day. There is simply no way to mistake the removal of an oil painting of Wolf sitting at a desk in a library, an Obama-style poster that says “Wolf” instead of “Hope,” and an artistic black-and-white photograph of the former Daily Show comedian doing stand-up at the Comedy Cellar for anything but a huge condemnation of Wolf’s hosting performance. With only a painting of Michelle Wolf standing next to Lincoln during the Gettysburg Address, a delicate marble bust of her, and four other works of art depicting the controversial figure remaining, Trump has made it known that he is furious with how the Correspondents’ Dinner went down. “No individual, comedian or otherwise, should be able to blatantly disrespect the administration in the way that Michelle did on Saturday and still expect all of their portraits to remain hanging in the Oval Office,” said a White House representative. “Ms. Wolf needs to understand that coming for President Trump and his colleagues with cheap personal attacks is no laughing matter, which is why we made the swift and unanimous decision to send two of her nine portraits back to the National Gallery and then move a third one to the Lincoln Bedroom so people won’t see it as much.” Damn. This is a cold condemnation of an artist who made a bold attempt to speak truth to power. With only five portraits and one chair that has her name embossed on the back staying in the Oval Office, it will be interesting to see whether Michelle Wolf continues to speak out or if she crumbles under the Trump administration’s brutal punishment. Either way, the president has made it clear he’s not to be trifled with, and it looks like Wolf probably won’t be invited back to the Correspondents’ Dinner next year. Shots fired, indeed!"
Farewell To A Legend: Goose Has Died In ‘Top Gun’,N/A,https://clickhole.com/farewell-to-a-legend-goose-has-died-in-top-gun-1825652109/,"A senseless tragedy has just occurred that’s going to leave you heartbroken: Goose has died in Top Gun. Absolutely heartbreaking. Without a doubt, this devastating loss is going to change the third act of Top Gun forever. At approximately a little over halfway through Top Gun, Radar Intercept Officer Nick “Goose” Bradshaw was participating in a standard dogfight engagement exercise when his F-14 Tomcat flew through the jet wash of Iceman’s aircraft, sending his plane into an unrecoverable tailspin. Although he and his partner, U.S. Naval Aviator Pete “Maverick” Mitchell, were able to eject from their aircraft, the ejection launched Goose headfirst into the plane’s jettisoned canopy before it cleared from his path, killing him instantly amid a series of slow-motion action shots. Although at first Top Gun viewers were clinging to the hope that Goose had somehow survived his terrible accident, the music in the movie took on a sad, melancholic tone that left no doubt in anyone’s mind that Goose had, indeed, passed away and the rest of Top Gun would continue on without his joyful smile and kind heart. Goose is survived by his wife portrayed by Meg Ryan and his 4-year-old son portrayed by the twin child actors Aaron and Adam Weiss. Our thoughts and prayers go out to them. Just terrible. This definitely can’t be easy for Goose’s best friend, Maverick, especially considering how often other Top Gun characters have warned him about flying so recklessly. You have to imagine the guilt of his close friend’s death will be weighing on his shoulders for the rest of the movie. All we can do now is remember all the kind words and hilarious one-liners that the screenwriters of the Top Gun script made Goose say before his screen time came to its tragically early end. Rest in peace, Goose. The rest of Top Gun won’t be the same without you."
Resistance Setback: Robert Mueller Has Abandoned The Russia Investigation After Determining That The Real Crime Is How Low The Prices Are On Kinja Deals,N/A,https://clickhole.com/resistance-setback-robert-mueller-has-abandoned-the-ru-1825651832/,"Members of the resistance, our best shot at impeaching Donald Trump pretty much died on the table today: Special counsel Robert Mueller has ended his investigation into Trump’s Russia ties after determining that the real crime is how low the prices are on Kinja Deals. This devastating gut punch completely lets Trump off the hook for colluding with Russia as Mueller pivots his investigation to focus exclusively on Kinja Deals, which are such great bargains, it’s practically stealing. This morning, FBI agents returned all of Michael Cohen’s documents to him, then swarmed the New York offices of the Gizmodo Media Group to seize computers and files proving a long-term conspiracy by Kinja Deals to knowingly and intentionally offer the best deals on the web. As colleagues from sister websites like Kotaku and Jalopnik watched in shock, federal agents, who just yesterday had been digging into Trump’s Russian business associates, led the Kinja commerce writers out of GMG offices in handcuffs to await trial. Mueller wasted no time bringing the full weight of the government against the Kinja Deals team, filing charges that accuse the site of “robbing trusted brands like Bose and KitchenAid blind by offering their must-have products for the lowest prices ever.” Considering the egregious amount of savings that Kinja Deals has slashed from fan-favorite companies, their editors now face life imprisonment in maximum-security prisons while Trump and his idiot cronies get away with treason. Drumpf must be shaking his tiny hands in triumph, knowing that his crimes will never be prosecuted because the crimes of Kinja Deals are much worse. In another blow to the resistance, Mueller’s indictment fully exonerates President Cheeto of ever posting links to incredible discounts, stating that “although Trump is innocent of saving people a depraved amount of money, there is widespread and ongoing collusion between Kinja Deals and Amazon to promote daily Gold Box sales that are so good they should be illegal.” However, the most surprising part of Robert Mueller’s announcement is that he also filed charges against himself, confessing that he was tempted by a Kinja top-tech deal and deserves to be executed for buying an Anker portable charger for the low, low price of $36. Robert Mueller then resigned from the Justice Department and turned himself over to the police for arrest, putting the final nail in the coffin of every decent American’s hopes that Drumpf will get what he deserves. Resisters, unfortunately it looks like we’re going to have to suffer through the remainder of Trump’s presidency now that Mueller is off the Russia case. Our only solace during this dark era in American history is that Kinja Deals is finally paying for its misdeeds."
"Worth The Wait: After Sorting Out Their Scheduling Conflicts, Over 400 Musicians Are Ready To Play A Relief Concert For The Victims Of Hurricane Andrew",N/A,https://clickhole.com/worth-the-wait-after-sorting-out-their-scheduling-conf-1825164239/,"If you’re a music lover, hold on to your seat, because this is the charity collaboration of a lifetime: After spending nearly 30 years sorting out their scheduling conflicts, over 400 world-class musicians are set to play a relief concert for the victims of Hurricane Andrew. Wow. This is guaranteed to be amazing. When the Category 5 hurricane ravaged Florida and the Bahamas in August of 1992, celebrities knew they had to do something. And after ironing out everyone’s calendars, a group of 400 incredible musicians has finally set a date for an Aid For Andrew concert that will raise funds to help rebuild the areas that sustained billions of dollars in damage 26 years ago. The absolutely stacked lineup features Billy Joel, R.E.M., U2, Stevie Wonder, Paul Simon, and 395 other artists who were finally able to find a time when they all had three spare hours on the same day in order to join together to help alleviate the destruction that Andrew left in its wake all those years ago. The concert will begin with Bono himself giving the audience a quick reminder of what Hurricane Andrew was in case there are people in the audience who have forgotten what it was over the past few decades, or who were born way after it happened. He’ll then perform an unforgettable duet with Bruce Springsteen, who just now found a free time slot in his schedule after touring nonstop during the ’90s. Absolutely beautiful. It’s so incredibly kind that all of these generous celebs were willing to spend more than a quarter-century to settle on a time that worked for everyone’s calendars to come together and help the communities devastated by this terrible storm. It might have been a long time coming, but it sounds like the Aid For Andrew concert is going to be 100 percent worth the wait!"
Deeply Troubling: This Boxing Match Between John Cena And Michael Caine Seemed Like It Was Going To Be For A Good Cause But No Charities Appear To Be Involved And Michael Caine Looks Pretty Injured,N/A,https://clickhole.com/deeply-troubling-this-boxing-match-between-john-cena-a-1825274240/,"Well, this is definitely some disturbing news. When John Cena and Michael Caine first announced they would be facing off against each other in a boxing match, everyone just kind of assumed it would be a tongue-in-cheek stunt that raised money for a good cause. But now Jonn Cena and Michael Caine are five rounds into their no-holds-barred boxing match without a single mention of any sort of charity to speak of, and Michael Caine is starting to look pretty hurt. Yikes. Whatever this is, it certainly can’t be good.  It would stand to reason that when John Cena tweeted, “It’s finally happening. TONIGHT: CENA V. CAINE,” alongside a photo of a shirtless Michael Caine in boxing gloves this morning, he did so because the renowned 85-year-old actor agreed to fight him in some sort of charity match. While John Cena didn’t specifically mention any charities or nonprofits involved in the event, it seemed like it was pretty much a given that if Michael Caine was going to enter the ring with a professional wrestler, it would be in some sort of controlled setting intended to raise money for a cause they’re both invested in. Now, seeing John Cena enter his sixth round of absolutely pummeling Michael Caine in the boxing ring, it’s pretty hard to ignore the fact that there are no signs for a charity anywhere, and even at the beginning of the bout, when Michael Caine wasn’t severely concussed, he still never even tried to rally the crowd for donations.  What exactly is going on here? Things are definitely starting to look a bit dicey for Michael Caine.  While you’d think that these two celebrities would be facing off to raise money for some sort of cause, there’s a sign outside the door that says, “Free admission,” and the guy with the folding table who’s been selling snacks to the crowd seems to be putting the money he’s been getting back into his own wallet. For a second it looked like maybe the little girl in the front row with the breathing tube was going to be introduced as someone who needed help paying for medical expenses, but by all appearances she’s just here to enjoy the bloodbath with everyone else. The referee keeps referring to the event as Sock It To Pneumonia, but the lack of donation opportunities is starting to make it unclear whether they’re raising money for the disease or whether “Pneumonia” is just Michael Caine’s nickname. Whatever forces brought Michael Caine and John Cena together for this boxing match, it definitely looks like neither of them is holding back at all. John Cena pretty much started wailing on Michael Caine the second the starting bell dinged, and for his part, Michael Caine has been refusing to tap out, even though he’s pretty clearly suffered some major injuries at this point. After every round, Michael Caine spits blood on the ground and asks John Cena, “That’s all you got?” before raising his fists to go again, and John Cena really lets him have it, even though you’d think he’d really be holding back more if this were just some sort of charity match. But now he’s got Michael Caine against the ropes and the entire crowd is chanting, “Finish him,” and it doesn’t look like this event ever had any sort of philanthropic mission to speak of. Huh. It’s hard to say exactly what’s going on here, but whatever it is, things are looking pretty bleak for Michael Caine. This definitely cannot be good."
Almost Had Him: The Police Have Released The Golden State Killer From Custody Because He Was Just Too Creepy,N/A,https://clickhole.com/almost-had-him-the-police-have-released-the-golden-sta-1825601318/,"When police arrested a man they believed to be the Golden State Killer yesterday, the world celebrated as one of history’s most brutal and notorious serial killers was finally captured more than 40 years after his reign of terror began. However, it sadly looks like justice will have to wait for another day: the police have released the Golden State Killer from custody because he was just too creepy to be around. Devastating. It looks like this notorious killer is once again on the loose. Authorities announced today that after arresting 72-year-old Joseph James DeAngelo based on DNA evidence identifying him as the Golden State Killer, they were forced to release him early this morning because he was giving everyone at the station a serious case of the heebie-jeebies. According to reports, DeAngelo was just freaky to look at, and officers didn’t like having him in custody because it seemed like he was reading their thoughts every time he looked at them with his spooky eyes. Detectives on the case say they tried to interrogate DeAngelo, but decided against it because they could just tell that once he started confessing, he’d probably start licking his lips and get all weird and call his victims his “little playthings” or something fucked up like that. “We’ve released Joseph James DeAngelo from custody because honestly, this whole story freaks us out and after getting a good look at the guy, we’d rather not hear his raspy voice give us all the creepy details of his crimes.” said Sacramento County Sheriff Scott Jones. “He looked like the kind of guy that could start laughing maniacally at any moment, and we were worried that if we kept this freaky weirdo in a jail cell too much longer, he was going to do something really messed up like just start reciting details about our kids and spouses, and ultimately we determined the best course of action was to get him the hell out of here.” “We have officers on the force who have to work the late shift, and we absolutely do not want to have to be alone in the same building with this eerie fucker in the middle of the night,” Jones added. Sheriff Jones then went on to explain that during their decades-long investigations into the Golden State Killer case, the police department had deliberately avoided DeAngelo’s house because everyone on the force agreed that he gave them a serious case of the willies and just looking at his house sent chills up their spine. Wow. This is heartbreaking. Just when it seemed like the Golden State Killer would finally be brought to justice, he has evaded capture once again. Hopefully a different agency catches him soon, because it sounds like the Sacramento Police Department was just too spooked by the guy."
A Slippery Slope: Could Bill Cosby’s Conviction Lead To A Mob Mentality Where Society Wantonly Punishes Any Serial Rapist After Decades Of Inaction?,N/A,https://clickhole.com/a-slippery-slope-could-bill-cosby-s-conviction-lead-to-1825581348/,"Bill Cosby was convicted on three counts of aggravated indecent assault, and though it seems Cosby is in fact guilty, the frenzied mass reaction from the public raises a troubling question: Could Bill Cosby’s conviction lead to a mob mentality where society wantonly punishes any serial rapist after decades of inaction? Yes, we all want to live in a world where people are safe from sexual assault, but at the same time, we must be cautious, because if we’re not careful and start punishing people like Bill Cosby every time a flood of credible victim testimonials circulate around them for years and years, we may find ourselves living in a society where our emotions get the better of us and we start jailing anybody at all just because a jury finds them guilty of rape in a trial convened years and years after the initial accusations arose. The stark reality we as a society must consider is that Bill Cosby is going to prison simply because 50 women came forward to provide meticulous accounts of how he sexually assaulted them. If we’re not careful, we may one day find ourselves living in a world in which it only takes 49 women to come forward with credible accusations of rape to send someone to prison. Where does this lead? Will we start throwing people in prison based on the corroborated accounts of just 10 women? Eight women? A number that low might seem ridiculous now, but if we are not wary of succumbing to mob justice, then Bill Cosby’s conviction may very well lead to a dystopian world where all it takes is just a handful of meticulously vetted rape accusations to land you in jail 14 years after the fact. Cosby’s conviction proves that we as a society run the risk of letting mob mentality pressure us into issuing extremely belated prison sentences to anybody just because they’ve been committing premeditated sexual assault for decades. It is deeply troubling to consider that the witch hunt mentality of the #MeToo movement might be creating an environment in which any time someone is accused of rape multiple times, we make the snap decision to spin our wheels for a few decades before ultimately finding him guilty following a years-long criminal investigation and drawn-out trial process. If we let ourselves get caught up in mass hysteria and punish a man for living out most of his life as a serial rapist, we’re setting a dangerous precedent that will allow us to remorselessly convict long-ignored rapists in the future. The American judicial system must not turn into a brazen free-for-all where anyone who wants to put a longtime rapist in jail can do so if they’re willing to spend years being ignored and vilified before enduring a protracted, nearly unsuccessful trial. The Cosby conviction is the first step on an incredibly slippery slope, and we must all be careful lest our entire country fall down it."

"Science FTW: A Team Of Weeping, Blood-Soaked Researchers Has Announced That The Music Of Phil Collins Makes Pandas Kill Each Other",N/A,https://clickhole.com/science-ftw-a-team-of-weeping-blood-soaked-researcher-1825164513/,"Here’s some exciting news from the animal kingdom that’s really changing our understanding of the natural world. After an eventful morning at Zoo Atlanta’s giant-panda enclosure, a team of weeping, blood-soaked researchers has announced that the music of Phil Collins makes pandas kill each other! Wow! What an incredible revelation about one of the world’s most beloved animals. The groundbreaking discovery was made earlier today when a team of five zoologists turned on a Phil Collins Pandora station to listen to while they checked the animals’ vitals and accidentally triggered almost 15 minutes of unhinged bloodletting amongst the four giant pandas currently living in captivity at Zoo Atlanta. At first, the scientists weren’t sure what had caused the peaceful mammals to suddenly commit brutal familicide, but when female panda Ya Lun attempted to crush her father’s skull in perfect synchronization with the big drum fill of Collins’ 1981 hit “In The Air Tonight,” everything started to make sense to the rattled researchers. “Based on the images and sounds that now haunt me even when my eyes are open, I am able to confirm that the music of prolific singer-songwriter Phil Collins turns pandas into soulless demons whose most desperate desire is to annihilate their own species in shocking and frankly creative ways,” announced team lead Samuel Hawthorne, who was found wandering several feet from the panda enclosure covered in animal viscera. Hawthorne retired from the field of animal research shortly after making this historic statement. So awesome! And that’s not all—according to reports cobbled together from the crazed mutterings of the rest of the research team, songs by Phil Collins’ band Genesis actually seemed to stimulate a more controlled murderous rage in the pandas, resulting in slower actions like tearing and squeezing, whereas the Tarzan soundtrack triggered complete and total dissociative homicidal madness. This just goes to show that no matter how far science has come, we are still learning new things every day about the world around us. We hope that Hawthorne’s team will be released from trauma care so they can keep blowing our minds for years to come!"
No Competition: ‘The New York Times’ Has Announced It Will Only Cover News About Koko The Gorilla Because Nothing Will Ever Be More Newsworthy Than A Talking Animal,N/A,https://clickhole.com/no-competition-the-new-york-times-has-announced-it-w-1825500808/,"America’s most iconic newspaper just made a major editorial decision that experts say is going to change journalism forever: The New York Times has announced that it will only cover news about Koko, the gorilla who knows sign language, because nothing will ever be more newsworthy than a talking animal. Amazing. If you’re a Times subscribers get ready for a nonstop barrage of articles about this miraculous gorilla. While The New York Times has reported on Koko periodically in the past, today it announced a new commitment to filling every column inch of its paper with news about her, because nothing else it could possibly write about could ever really compete with the fact that Koko is a gorilla who knows how to use sign language to ask questions, give answers, and even joke around with her caretakers. “We as a staff have realized that there’s literally nothing more inherently newsworthy than the fact that there’s an ape out there that knows how to express complex concepts like guilt and grief via conversations with human beings,” said New York Times executive editor Dean Baquet. “Even if a nuclear war were to break out or the president of the United States were to be assassinated at this very moment, it simply would not be as newsworthy as the fact that a goddamn gorilla has the language skills necessary to ask for a pet cat like something out of a science fiction story.” “Koko the gorilla is some straight-up Chronicles Of Narnia shit, and The New York Times would be doing our readers a major disservice if we reported on anything else other than this incredible miracle,” Baquet added. The change will come along with a reorganization of the paper—editors plan to replace sections like News, Politics, Business, and Sports with sections including Words Koko The Gorilla Said Today, Humans Who Talked To Koko The Gorilla Like A Real-Life Dr. Doolittle, and Other Gorillas That Can Also Somehow Talk. Even Koko’s everyday activities like eating and sleeping will receive extensive coverage in the paper of record, since the editorial staff has concluded that literally anything a talking animal does is automatically of pressing interest to the public and needs to be reported. Incredible. It’s amazing to see a news organization that’s willing to overhaul its entire writing process to bring its readers the most pressing news. We can’t wait to start reading constant updates about Koko the gorilla. Bravo, New York Times!"
A Kingpin Falls: The Leader Of MS-13 Was Apprehended After Filling Up A Free Water Cup With Dr. Pepper At A Soda Dispenser,N/A,https://clickhole.com/a-kingpin-falls-the-leader-of-ms-13-was-apprehended-af-1825164201/,"Get ready, because this incredible story of justice will make you stand up and cheer. For more than 20 years, the infamously violent gang MS-13 has been the bane of law enforcement officials throughout the U.S., with Los Angeles cell leader Javier Elizondo sitting high on the FBI’s Most Wanted list. Major kingpins like Elizondo are often meticulous about covering their tracks, but today the powerful gang leader slipped up in a major way: MS-13 leader Javier Elizondo was apprehended by police after filling up a free water cup with Dr. Pepper at a soda dispenser.  Wow. After almost two decades of evading the law, this criminal mastermind was finally caught with a smoking gun. According to witnesses, it was business as usual at the Subway on Glendale Boulevard when one of America’s most dangerous racketeers dropped by for a 6-inch BLT and a cup of “water.” Initially, Elizondo used his well-honed criminal instincts successfully, sneaking an illicit cup of Dr. Pepper by sort of fake-pushing the little water tab and awkwardly keeping his back to the cash register on the walk back to his seat. However, like so many powerful men before him, Elizondo’s confidence ultimately spelled his undoing. On his second trip to the fountain, Southern California’s most dangerous gang leader got cocky and blatantly mixed some Hi-C Flashin’ Fruit Punch and Sierra Mist with the Dr. Pepper in his complimentary plastic cup. The cashier demanded that Elizondo pay for the stolen soda, which caused an altercation that an off-duty police officer witnessed. What started as pure hubris from a man responsible for a $30 million a year in drug and human trafficking operation led to him being handcuffed and taken to the station for a simple misdemeanor before local police quickly realized the magnitude of the criminal who had dropped into their lap. Incredible. This is a major coup for state and local officials, who have been trying to nail Elizondo for years. “We are proud to confirm that Javier Elizondo, a member of MS-13 responsible for countless operations of drug trafficking, weapons smuggling, money laundering, extortion, and murder, was successfully apprehended by LAPD earlier today after putting Dr. Pepper into a cup that had been given to him solely for water,” said Los Angeles police chief Dan Collins. “We are thrilled that Elizondo didn’t decide to just steal Sprite, which kind of looks like water, or we might never have gotten him.” So awesome. This just goes to show that in the end, justice will always find a way to prevail. Here’s hoping that the rest of MS-13 falls close behind its leader!"
The NRA Is Claiming That The Tennessee Waffle House Shooting Would Not Have Happened If An Armed Teacher Had Been Teaching A Math Class There,N/A,https://clickhole.com/the-nra-is-claiming-that-the-tennessee-waffle-house-sho-1825479149/,"After yesterday’s tragic shooting at a Waffle House in Antioch, TN, the NRA has once again come forward to reiterate their support of gun rights and the Second Amendment. Early this morning, NRA Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre held a press conference to discuss how such episodes of gun violence can be prevented by well-trained, armed school teachers who happen to be holding math class in a Waffle House. Yep, there’s no arguing the NRA out of its stance on this one: It simply believes that arming teachers is the best and only way to stop mass shootings. “I have no doubt in my mind that if a well-armed teacher with easy access to a firearm had been teaching calculus at the Waffle House yesterday, it could have saved four lives,” LaPierre stated. “Critics of the Second Amendment will start calling for harsher gun laws, when the real answer is to put guns in the hands of teachers and hope they make the snap decision to teach their classes at a Waffle House for some reason on the same day that a violent gunman decides to go on a rampage.” LaPierre concluded his statement by proposing a policy for preventing future massacres by making sure all American restaurants have armed teachers giving lectures in their dining rooms at all times. Wow. It sounds like the NRA has a clear solution for preventing gun violence! It can definitely be scary living in a country where mass shootings happen on such a regular basis. If we can follow the NRA’s advice and make sure an armed teacher is present during every single attempted massacre, we might one day live in a world where we’re free of these types of tragedies forever!"
Public Alert: The CDC Has Issued A Recall For All Romaine Lettuce Because It’s Time For Pizza!,N/A,https://clickhole.com/public-alert-the-cdc-has-issued-a-recall-for-all-romai-1825476860/,"If you haven’t heard the news yet, pay attention, because there’s been an urgent public alert issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: Effective immediately, there is a nationwide recall for all romaine lettuce because it’s time for pizza! Wow. Hopefully no one you know or love is currently eating romaine lettuce, because it’s pizza time! In a statement released earlier today, the CDC urged Americans to throw out any and all romaine lettuce bought in the past week because it’s time for some cheesy, piping-hot pizza with all your favorite toppings! The agency’s statement also warns that anybody who consumes romaine salad products of any kind puts themselves at serious risk of missing out on pizza time, because you know that fresh ’za and all the bread sticks and dipping sauces are going to go fast! Romaine lettuce distributors have also halted production at their facilities, wanting to be very cautious that they not make the problem of Americans failing to realize it’s time for the cheesy treat known as pizza even worse. Unfortunately, thousands of Americans have probably already consumed romaine lettuce before the CDC could issue the recall, so be sure to spread the word to family and friends so none of them spoil their appetite eating romaine lettuce when all the pizza they can handle is on the way!"
Bowing Out: Justin Timberlake Has Retired From Singing After Realizing That You Can Just Work In An Office,N/A,https://clickhole.com/bowing-out-justin-timberlake-has-retired-from-singing-1825458079/,"One of pop music’s most iconic superstars just announced that he’s stepping away from the microphone for good. Earlier today, Justin Timberlake issued a statement letting the world know that he’s retiring from singing after realizing you can just work in an office. Wow. This is truly the end of an era. “After more than 30 years as a professional singer with ’N Sync and as a solo artist, it has recently dawned on me that I can just go to work in an office, which seems more peaceful and convenient than working as a pop star in every conceivable way, and so I will be quitting music forever,” Timberlake said in the shocking message he posted on his official Instagram page this morning. “As a singer, I have to go on extremely long and exhausting plane rides all over the world, but people who work in offices get to go to the same place every day and it takes them, like, 45 minutes. Plus, in an office you get to do your job without thousands and thousands of people screaming at you like they do to me every time I walk on stage. You get to sit in your cubicle where it’s quiet, and that’s why I’m going to go work in an office and never sing again.” Timberlake’s shocking message goes on to describe dozens of other reasons why he finds working in an office far superior to being a pop singer, including an anecdote of how he recently learned that in offices you’re allowed to eat lunch right at your desk while you work, whereas if he tried to eat lunch while singing “SexyBack” during a sold-out show in Ibiza, he would get yelled at. He concludes the statement by announcing that all tour dates promoting his new album Man Of The Woods will be canceled so that he can focus on applying for a job in an office that has a copy machine the former teen heartthrob can use for free whenever he wants. It’s hard to say goodbye to a performer as amazing as Justin Timberlake, but it’s definitely been an incredible ride. We wish him the best of luck out there on the job market!"
This Chilling Video Of George W. Bush And John Kerry Singing ‘This Land Is Your Land’ Shows How Easy It Is To Use Digital Facial Mapping To Fake Anyone Doing Anything,N/A,https://clickhole.com/this-chilling-video-of-george-w-bush-and-john-kerry-si-1825424408/,"After the 2016 election, it became clear just how successfully trolls and foreign enemies have been using the internet to undermine the democratic process. Unfortunately, technological advancements are guaranteeing that the problem’s only going to get worse before it gets any better. Want proof? This disturbing video of George W. Bush and John Kerry singing “This Land Is Your Land” shows just how easy it is to use digital facial mapping tools to fake anyone doing anything. See the chilling evidence for yourself below.  Yikes. This is terrifying. Technology this seamless could be unfathomably dangerous in the wrong hands. If we didn’t know any better, we would have been totally convinced George W. Bush actually rode a nuclear missile or that John Kerry cut open Bush’s head and put a brain in there. The rapid spread of misinformation online is a serious issue that our leaders have yet to address effectively. If action isn’t taken soon, falsified videos like this may be enough to sway entire elections, or worse. All we can do now is learn to recognize signs that what we’re watching isn’t the truth and hope that millions of American voters learn to do so as well. Our democracy depends on it."
Absolutely Heartbreaking: The Editor Of Snopes Just Listed His Marriage Of 28 Years As A Hoax,N/A,https://clickhole.com/absolutely-heartbreaking-the-editor-of-snopes-just-lis-1825158951/,"We all want to believe that love lasts forever, but the editor of Snopes, Patrick Gourley, just busted that myth wide open: He has officially listed his marriage of 28 years as a hoax. Absolutely devastating. It certainly looks like Patrick’s marriage is not everything it appeared to be. Patrick published the heartbreaking post on Snopes early this morning, and within just a few hours the devastating story revealing the fraudulent nature of the Snopes editor’s marriage to wife, Anne Davis, had drawn thousands of views: The Snopes report goes on to reveal that any photographs that show Patrick and Anne smiling together are little more than documentary evidence of two people lying to each other and to themselves about their deteriorating relationship. It also points out that, while many people had interpreted the three children that Patrick and Anne had together as evidence that their marriage was strong enough to sustain a growing family, the kids were in fact nothing more than the by-products of the couple’s delusional notion that having another baby would somehow rekindle a spark of love that, when you get right down to it, most likely never even existed in the first place. Wow. Once again the editor of Snopes just taught us all a powerful and deeply sad lesson about how important it is to verify everything you read in an era of widespread misinformation. People of the internet, take note!"
Making Contact: Hundreds Of Alien Civilizations Have Journeyed To Earth After Finding Out About Walnuts,N/A,https://clickhole.com/making-contact-hundreds-of-alien-civilizations-have-jo-1825416359/,"For millennia, mankind has wondered if it was truly alone in the universe, but years of speculation can now finally be put to bed for good: Hundreds of alien civilizations have made contact with Earth after finding out about walnuts. What a landmark moment for the universe as we know it. Aliens are out there, and they want walnuts. The landings began at 2:05 a.m. last night, when the first of the alien species made contact with a walnut processing plant in California’s San Fernando Valley. The aliens, a supremely wise and benevolent species that hails from the distant Horsehead Nebula, disembarked from their ship in a single-file line, rubbed the walnuts with their thousands of cilia-type appendages that protrude from what appeared to be their necks, and then boarded their ship once more. Since that time, more than 400 alien species from many far-flung galaxies of the universe have emerged from the night sky, each expressing interest in seeing a walnut or at least having it described to them in detail. Absolutely incredible. We now know beyond a shadow of a doubt that intelligent life exists on other planets, and that it’s definitely interested in walnuts. Since arriving to Earth, many of the alien species have been landing in cold climates that are inhospitable to growing tree nuts, and yet nearly all of them have emerged holding up images of walnuts, demanding to be taken to them. One perplexing species put a walnut next to a marble and appeared to fall asleep for five hours. Another has been flying in circles over Italy, burning the word “WOLNART” into open pastures while abducting all nearby pistachios. While few of the species have made direct contact with humans, a hive mind of nanobots placed a single obsidian disk on the foot of the White House lawn. The disk, which was engraved in cryptic runes, was decoded by researchers to read, “We are the reigning race from planet Arthoid D7, and we have come to your home in search of the promised nut that drives us crazy with the lust of hunger. We are here to meet the humble walnut who has promised to us its shriveled hand in marriage. We will eradicate all life on Earth if it pleases the walnut. We are deathly allergic to the miraculous living wrinkle called the walnut, and would please like to die now by dancing next to Earth’s greatest mistake, the hideous wooded raisin that fills our minds with love fever.” Wow, what an incredibly awe-inspiring event. The universe is home to many great and wise civilizations, and they have all journeyed to Earth to get a look at walnuts. This truly is the greatest time to be alive!"
"After An Island-Wide Blackout Left Millions Of Puerto Ricans Without Power, This Amazing Charity Air-Dropped Printouts Of The Most Epic Trump Takedowns On Twitter",N/A,https://clickhole.com/after-an-island-wide-blackout-left-millions-of-puerto-r-1825397803/,"Here’s heartwarming proof that some people will stop at nothing to offer help in a dire situation. Puerto Rico was struck by disaster yet again Wednesday afternoon when an issue with a transmission tower caused the entire island to lose power. But in the face of this adversity, an incredible disaster relief organization called Aid The Way stepped in and made all the difference: In the midst of the blackout, this amazing charity air-dropped printouts of the most epic Trump takedowns on Twitter to the citizens of Puerto Rico so they wouldn’t miss anything. Wow. This is an incredible gesture that will seriously help the people of Puerto Rico in their time of need. Just hours after the news broke that Puerto Rico was without power, the heroes at Aid The Way mobilized thousands of volunteers to collect the most recent @realDonaldTrump slams that the unfortunate citizens of Puerto Rico would be in dire need of as their lack of electricity drags on. Never once forgetting their mission to make sure that Puerto Ricans are up to date on the latest tweets deriding Trump’s small hands or GIF of his hair flapping in the wind, volunteers worked through the night to get planes in the air to make sure the island was aware the #Resistance is still sticking it to POTUS good on the internet. “Due to the blackout, Puerto Ricans have now been tragically unable to to see tweets that compare Donald Trump’s skin to a Cheeto for over 24 hours, so we knew we had to help,” read a post that quickly went viral on the charity’s Facebook page. “It will be weeks or even months before Puerto Rico will recover from this humanitarian crisis of not having the latest photoshops of Trump with a Hitler mustache, but Aid The Way will not stop dropping printed-out Drumpf clapbacks until the last Puerto Rican has power.” So inspiring! According to Aid The Way, a plane full of sick internet burns is already on its way to the island that will have beleaguered Puerto Ricans saying things like “got him!” and “totally owned” in no time. Thanks to dedicated relief organizations like this one, it seems like Puerto Rico will be on its way to recovery in no time. Incredible work, Aid The Way!"
"A Historic Loss: Barbara Bush, A Woman Famous For Never Once Being Horny For The ‘Stranger Things’ Kids, Has Passed Away At The Age Of 92",N/A,https://clickhole.com/a-historic-loss-barbara-bush-a-woman-famous-for-never-1825362760/,"There’s no way around it, today is a deeply sad day for America: Barbara Bush, a woman famous for never once being horny for the Stranger Things kids, has passed away at the age of 92. Wow. This is a huge loss that is sure to be felt throughout the country. Bush (née Pierce) will forever be remembered for her generous spirit, her razor-sharp wit, and most of all, her incredible ability to never be turned on at the thought of the underage actors on Netflix’s popular original series. While many internet users have thirsted for Finn Wolfhard, Millie Bobby Brown, and the rest of the Hawkins gang, Barbara Bush remained bravely unaroused, never once tweeting that she’d like “to get a piece” of any one of the Demogorgon-fighting teens. Bush was in the public eye for decades, and the fact that there is not even one single moment when a hot mic caught her describing what she’d do to Finn Wolfhard on the night he turns 18 shows just what an impressive woman she was. History will surely look kindly on Barbara, a moral exemplar who will be deeply missed by a nation that was in constant awe of her near-biblical level of self-control when it came to getting super horned up over the Stranger Things cast. She is survived by her husband, former President George H.W. Bush, and her five children."
Lending A Hand: H&M Has Added A Life Alert Button To Its Dressing Rooms To Save People Who Have A Stroke Seeing How Good They Look In Jeans,N/A,https://clickhole.com/lending-a-hand-h-m-has-added-a-life-alert-button-to-it-1825274433/,"Companies like H&M know the importance of customer safety, which is why the clothing giant is taking extra precautions to put its shoppers’ minds at ease: H&M has added a Life Alert button to its dressing rooms to save people who have a stroke seeing how good they look in jeans.  Good on you, H&M. This will go a long way toward ensuring that nobody dies an easily preventable death in any of your stores. Help is now just a button-push away for those who shop at H&M, should they ever try on a pair of jeans and become so immensely stunned by how well the pants fit that it causes the person to suffer a stroke right there in the store. Gone are the days of having your face droop as your brain struggles to get enough oxygen because it can’t process just how jealous your ex will be when they see how those jeans hug your hips, and it’s the Swedish clothing giant that’s leading the way. “Here at H&M, we understand that your ass will look so piping hot filling out our jeans and jean shorts that the shock of it all will most likely trigger a blood vessel to rupture inside your brain, thus leading to a massive intracranial hemorrhage and you passing out on the floor,” said H&M CEO Karl-Johan Persson in a shareholder’s call that took place earlier today. “Now people can rest easy knowing that if their life is at risk as they begin convulsing due to how overwhelmingly sexy they find themselves wearing our jeans, they can simply press the button and help will be on the way.”  And it’s good news for H&M’s employees, too. They no longer have to dread cleaning up at the end of the day only to discover someone’s lifeless corpse totally rocking a pair of ultra-cute skinny jeans. And as an added bonus, in the rare event that anyone presses the button and paramedics don’t arrive quickly enough before the stroke causes permanent damage, H&M will take 50 percent off the jeans’ price to make up for the delay, proving that the company is looking out for people both medically and financially.  While critics will argue that H&M should be doing more to help customers who die after having too much sex because they look so damn hot in their jeans, you’ve got to hand it to H&M for this amazing first step. With Life Alert buttons already installed in every H&M location, customers can try on jeans knowing that they’re in good hands as they stare at their sexy bod in the mirror during the final seconds before their vision completely blurs. Rest assured that your safety is H&M’s No. 1 priority!"

Indeed, it is Comey, the kingmaker and kingbreaker who wields Hillary’s emails in one hand and the coveted Steele dossier in the other! Ah, yes! Democrats, gawk in wide-eyed stupefaction of Comey, the creature of paradox, as our nation’s Congress calls on him to answer for his baffling duality, a task of pure futility! To ask whether Comey will save America or is responsible for its ruin is to ask God himself, “Why are your creations so?” As tall as he is perplexing, Comey—living puzzle who is neither Angel nor Devil, or perhaps both at once!—comes into view and one cannot help but wonder how one man can wield Anthony Weiner’s inbox to such disastrous effect, yet ignite Trump’s fury in utterly exultant fashion! Hurry, hurry! Gather ’round Comey, the Eighth Wonder, anomaly in human form, as he heads from town to town, network to network, high-profile interview after high-profile interview, to bewilder hearts and minds further! The FBI’s beautiful ogre of contradiction has forged a book from the fire of his abnormality that will hurl the unfit president who Comey himself helped defeat Hillary into a rage for the ages! For in the world of Comey, justice must fail in order for justice to be done, just as one must be the villain that gets Drumpf elected in order to be the hero that gets Drumpf impeached! Come one, come all, liberals who dare submit to the riddle of intentions that is Comey, the beast of enigmatic loyalty to all and none!"
Supporting Its Passion: Coca-Cola Is Launching A Patreon To Crowdfund Its Soda Business,N/A,https://clickhole.com/supporting-its-passion-coca-cola-is-launching-a-patreo-1825159052/,"When you want to keep doing what you love, sometimes it’s best to just go directly to the people who love what you do. And that’s precisely what one passionate soda manufacturer is doing: Coca-Cola has started a Patreon page to crowdfund its love of making carbonated beverages. Awesome! It’s great that the internet is willing to chip in and help The Coca-Cola Company fund its creative dream of continuing to make Coca-Cola. On its Patreon, Coca-Cola explains that producing 800 million bottles and cans of soda per day can get expensive, with lots of hidden costs like buying thousands of tons of aluminum from wholesalers and shipping the final product to millions of stores in more than 200 countries. According to the soda corporation, it’s hoping that the generosity of Patreon backers will ensure it always has the resources it needs to stop worrying about money, focus on its craft, and keep delivering Coca-Cola to grocery stores and restaurants so people can buy it. Aside from helping the 60,000 Coca-Cola employees continue their passion, your monthly donation to Coca-Cola will also earn you some pretty cool, exclusive backer rewards. At the minimum tier of $1, you’ll receive a monthly thank-you email from Coca-Cola. At $20 a month, you’ll receive a physical postcard with a picture of a can of Coca-Cola on it, to show you what you’re helping make. And at the high-tier level of $100 a month, you’ll receive an actual 20-ounce plastic bottle full of Coca-Cola, letting you directly experience the end result of your charitable contribution. Coca-Cola can rest assured knowing that it’s got plenty of grateful fans willing to give back to a company that’s sold them so much soda over the years. It’s another crowdfunding win thanks to Patreon!"
PR Disaster: United Airlines Has Apologized To A Passenger After The Bomb In His Suitcase Was Destroyed Mid-Flight,N/A,https://clickhole.com/pr-disaster-united-airlines-has-apologized-to-a-passen-1825254217/,"United Airlines has been no stranger to PR disasters in recent years, but unfortunately, this devastating new development takes the cake: The beleaguered air carrier has apologized to a passenger after the bomb in his suitcase was destroyed mid-flight. Jesus Christ, United Airlines. Can you maybe just not royally fuck something up for, like, two seconds? Bradley Horne was flying from the U.K. to Washington, D.C. on what should have been an otherwise easy airplane trip. But when he boarded the plane with a briefcase containing an improvised explosive device, a flight attendant took the bag from him and carelessly stowed it in a crammed overhead bin. Just 20 minutes into the flight during some turbulence, the bomb in the overloaded compartment exploded to the point that it was completely unrecognizable, and unusable to boot. United, we’re willing to let a few missteps slide, but passengers shouldn’t be walking onto planes with their bombs intact and walking off with them blown to smithereens. You’re going to have to win our trust back after this one. To its credit, United was quick to offer an apology to Horne over social media after the flight landed. “We accept total responsibility for this unfortunate accident, and we are deeply sorry for the pain and stress that the loss of this improvised explosive device caused Mr. Horne,” said Sharon Regan, a spokesperson for the airline. “Nothing would make us happier than if he had been able to land in DC with his bomb intact, but unfortunately, accidents happen, and all we can do is work hard to be more careful with the bombs that customers bring onto our planes in the future.” Wow. We’re impressed that United apologized, but this kind of snafu is totally unacceptable for a commercial airline. It’s going to be a while before anyone feels safe bringing a bomb onto a United flight."
