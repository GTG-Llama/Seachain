NEWLY DISCOVERED PLANETS SEEM TO BE UNHAPPY WE FOUND THEM,admin,https://www.satirewire.com/7-newly-discovered-exoplanets-seem-to-know-we-found-them/,"
 

LIEGE, BELGIUM (SatireWire.com) — In an astounding development, scientists today said the seven newly discovered exoplanets in a nearby constellation seem to be aware that we found them, and are not very happy about it.
At some point in the last few days, massive, etched symbols have appeared on the surfaces of the Earth-sized planets that, together, spell out: “Earth sux.”
Astronomer Michael Gillon of the STAR Institute in Belgium was among the first to see the symbols.
“We were excited by the initial discovery of the planets, but this morning, when my assistant told me actual letters had appeared, I was beyond excited,” Gillon said. “Until I saw them. Then I thought, ‘Oh. That’s not very nice.’”
Added MIT scientist Julien De Wit: “This is of course incredible news if you consider we now know there is life elsewhere in the universe, and if you don’t consider the part where that life basically just trolled us.”
The planets, in the Trappist-1 star system, had already set the astronomical world buzzing, as their size and surface temperatures indicated they could support water and life. How the symbols came to be, and what they might mean, has researchers confounded.
“It’s possible they are natural formations that were there all along but were only detected when the planets’ rotations were just right,” said South African astrophysicist Enrico Kotze. “But frankly, that seems unlikely. I can’t help but think that they’re attempting to communicate with us in a way that says, ‘We would very much like it if you didn’t attempt to communicate with us.’”
Given the Trappist-1 system’s distance, the mere fact that we can suddenly see the symbols also has scientists puzzled.
“That constellation is 39 million light years away, so technically, that message was created 39 million years ago and we’re just now seeing it,” said Gillon. “But – and I don’t know how they did it – I can’t help but feel it’s newer than that. There weren’t people here 39 million years ago, and that message is very personal.”
According to De Wit, every scientist on the project has come to an agreement on one aspect of the discovery.
“After contemplating the considerable engineering and logistical talent of transforming the surface of multiple planets into these giant symbols, we have decided they’re stupid planets and we never liked them anyway,” he said.

OLD GROWTH iPHONE FORESTS IN DANGER,admin,https://www.satirewire.com/old-growth-iphone-forests-in-danger/,"

OLYMPIA, WA. (SatireWire.com) – Old-growth iPhone forests are in danger of disappearing, according to environmentalists who accuse Apple of recklessly clear-cutting the uniquely adaptable metallic trees.
The iPhone, or mobilis iCogitatio, was once one of the most common trees in North America, outnumbered only by the red maple and the loblolly pine. But since Apple first discovered the leafless timber’s unusual properties – once sapped, it shrinks to handheld size – the company has harvested more than one billion of the majestic species. With sales of 200 million a year, the pace is unsustainable and irresponsible, said Sierra Club Director of Cooptation Sidney Luther.
“Even in ideal conditions, an iPhone takes at least 40 years to mature, so in order to keep the stock flowing, Apple has ruthlessly stripped old-growth forests where iPhones have stood for 300 or 400 years,” said Luther. “Yet last July, Apple had the gall to celebrate its one billionth iPhone sold. They actually celebrated! It’s barbaric. Do you celebrate killing a billion whales or murdering a billion flowers?”
Particularly galling, said Luther, are Apple’s repeated denials that iPhones are a natural resource.
“The company keeps claiming that iPhones are assembled in Chinese factories by underage and poorly paid workers because they don’t want you to know the horrible truth: Apple is harvesting ancient iPhones without regard to the environmental consequences,” he said. “Don’t believe me? Cut one open and count the rings.”
Apple refused to comment on this story, but did strongly advise consumers not to cut open an iPhone as it voids the warranty.
“Oh, of course they’d say that!” Luther responded.
According to the Natural Resources Defense Council, cutting old-growth forests is not just devastating to the trees and the land, but to the coexistent wildlife.
“There are literally hundreds of small and rare animals living in and around the iPhone canopy, including the unicorn, the mini-whale, the kitty tiger, and the yellow-faced smiley,” said NRDC spokesperson Kit Pernow. “People don’t realize that if these creatures can’t escape, they are permanently trapped in the iPhone when it’s sapped and shrunk. Apple, rather cynically, calls them ‘emoji,’ but you should know that when you tap on one, you are essentially punching the corpse of a once-living thing.
“People are awful,” she added.
Despite the fact that Apple will not acknowledge iPhone harvesting exists, activists plan to put up a fight on behalf of both the environment and the consumer.
“Because Apple has been so reckless, one day very soon we’re going to run out of iPhones, and what are we going to do then?” Luther said. “There aren’t any other trees suitable for mobile adaptation. Samsung already tried it, making the Galaxy 7 out of wood, and look what happened.”

"MELTING ARCTIC ICE EXPOSES ANCIENT, OMINOUS MESSAGE",admin,https://www.satirewire.com/melting-arctic-ice-exposes-ancient-ominous-message/,"

GREENLAND (SatireWire.com) — Scientists today said ice melt in the Arctic is perhaps much worse than previously thought, reaching their conclusion after a massive slab of glacier fell into the sea to expose the message: “If you can read this, you’re screwed.”
Written in letters 200 feet tall, the message was hidden deep inside Greenland’s massive Jakobshavn glacier, which formed 100,000 years ago and is one of the fastest melting ice sheets in the world.
“We don’t know who left that message or exactly when, but it’s pretty clear that whoever did was issuing a wake-up call,” said Danish glaciologist Dr. Tomas Frabil. “People can argue about the numbers surrounding global warming, but when the ice retreats to the point where you can read the words, ‘You’re screwed,’ that is pretty definitive.”
Climate skeptics, however, were quick to downplay the text, suggesting it may be a natural formation or the work of environmental activists. Experts ruled out a hoax, as the glacier calves so often and easily that anyone attempting to rappel down its face to sculpt the letters would die. And while unexpected shapes do appear in nature, no particularly rude words have been observed since lava flowing into the Sunda Strait after the 1883 Krakatoa eruption temporarily spelled out, “Bite me.”
For climatologist Ingrid Linsohm of McGill University, this leaves one conclusion.
“Some far-sighted, ancient civilization left that behind to tell us when we had reached the point of no return, and we’ve reached it. All is lost,” said Linsohm. “So, anybody got any heroin?”
But ExxonMobil Chaplain the Rev. Derrick Speuce had a different take.
“I think God put that message there because He knew it would one day be revealed, which means He knew about the ice melting, which means it was all part of His plan, which means there is no such thing as ‘man-made’ global warming, because it was God’s design all along,” said Rev. Speuce. “In other words, the Lord wants you to drive an Escalade.”

"CREATIONIST TELESCOPE FINDS NEARLY 6,000-YEAR-OLD GALAXY",admin,https://www.satirewire.com/creationist-telescope-finds-nearly-6000-year-old-galaxy/,"
PETERSBURG, KY (SatireWire.com) – Creationists using a deep-faith telescope said today they have discovered a galaxy formed at the very beginning of time, nearly 6,000 years ago. 
The galaxy, which they named “Michael” after one of the earliest angels, is about 6,000 light years from Earth, but not more, “because light did not exist before that time,” researchers explained.
A telescope (above) is an instrument that aids in the observation of remote objects by collecting electromagnetic radiation. A creationist telescope (below) is the exact same thing, but with the lens cap on.
 
The team’s discovery was immediately condemned by the American Astronomical Society, which said “Michael” is actually the Andromeda galaxy, which formed 9 billion years ago. In response, Bertram Hill, lead theophysicist at the subbasement Creation Science Observatory in Kentucky, said, “No it isn’t” and called the debate a tie.
 
Hill and his colleagues made their observations using a specially designed Deep Faith Creationist Telescope, which is a standard wide-field, Ritchey–Chrétien hyperbolic telescope, but with the lens cap on. From there, calculating the age of Michael, and the Universe itself, was simple, Hill said.
 
“We know this galaxy is about 6,000 years old because we know the Universe is 6,000 years old, and we know that because, contrary to what non-believers say, we’ve done the math,” said Hill. “Specifically, we’ve taken the ‘supposed’ age of the Universe – 13 billion years – and multiplied it by .000046, which gives us, as we suspected, the true age of 6,000.”
But why multiply the age of the Universe by .000046?
 
“Because that gives us 6,000,” said Hill.
 
Using this same multiplier, Hill said creationists plan to further shake up the scientific community by announcing that dinosaurs died out 3,000 years ago, Jesus was born last month, and Pittsburgh was founded on Tuesday.

HACKED FACEBOOK ACCOUNTS MAY EXPLAIN BILLIONS OF INANE POSTS,admin,https://www.satirewire.com/hacked-facebook-accounts-may-explain-billions-of-inane-posts/,"
NEW YORK, N.Y. (SatireWire.com) – Investigators who discovered hackers stole millions of user passwords from Facebook and other web sites said today account hijacking may finally explain the massive number of mind-numbing Facebook posts that appear on the site every day.
""What real person would post this?"" said cyber experts.
“It’s clear that malicious individuals have gotten into these accounts and, posing as the real users, posted the most useless and arbitrary things they could think of,” said CyberPicket CEO Marvin Distin. “How else would you explain a post like, ‘Another pretty sunset’ or ‘Went shopping today?’ Ordinary people wouldn’t do that. Obviously. It must be the work of some twisted hackers who get a sadistic kick out of filling the Internet with nothing.”
 
The stolen usernames and passwords from Facebook, Twitter and others, found on a server in the Netherlands, come from around the globe and have been collected over several years, according to CyberPicket. Facebook said it has reset the passwords for users whose accounts were compromised, but researchers are suspicious of that claim.
 
“It’s not fixed because these inane posts keep appearing,” said Distin. “Things like, ‘Eating breakfast at the Waffle House just outside Charlotte.’ ‘Looking forward to the weekend!’ These hackers must think we’re stupid.”
 
As an example, Distin cited a recent post by Facebook user Kent Siboben of Lindale, Ill., who posted a picture of his new mailbox and wrote ‘New mailbox!’ above it. “I’m sure Mr. Siboben would never do that himself,” Distin said.
 
However, reached via phone, Siboben admitted that he had posted the image. “Yeah, that was my new mailbox,” he said. “I thought it was, well, I don’t know what. Hey, a bunch of people ‘liked’ it.”
 
“My God, this is worse than I thought,” responded Distin. “The hackers have even infiltrated user phone numbers and are pretending to be actual people.”
 
According to security experts, the majority of hacked accounts found on the server had “absurdly simple” passwords associated with them, the most common being “123456,” followed by “123456789,” “1234,” “password” and “12345.” While some have suggested this is how hackers got into the accounts in the first place, Distin said it is more likely the infiltrators simplified the passwords.
“Actual people – those who knew anything about the Internet, anything at all – would never use ‘password’ as a password,” he said. “No, the hackers must have gotten in and changed the passwords to make it appear as if there are literally millions of incredibly moronic people on the Internet. Fortunately, this is so far from reality that we can see right through it.”

MYSTERY DISEASE AFFECTS ONE IN NEARLY EVERY HUMAN BEING,admin,https://www.satirewire.com/confusing-disease-affects-one-in-nearly-every-human-being/,"

CDC, ATLANTA (SatireWire) — It is known by many names: Common Fulgent Peplepsia, Magnate’s Curiosity Disease, Pendleton’s Old Forthwith, The Kitchen Dropsy, Partial Suggestive Consumption, Captain Abraham’s Pitchpole, Male Pattern Balls Cup, The Widow Confuser, The Belching Flirts, Mazelcoffin, Screamy Screamy Run Run, Pre-Seasonal Objective Disorder, Knackered’s Delight, and The Kissing Cyster, but one thing is universally known: 
Aparalytic Contradysfunctional Exoficial Disorder, or ACED, affects one in nearly every human being between the ages in the world.
 
Yes, it is that widespread.
If you have ACED, please don't take pictures. Ugh.
 
Forty years ago, even ten years ago, but for a brief period six years ago, ACED was never diagnosed. Just as people with ADHD were once labeled hyperactive, or overly impulsive, or inattentive, or, medically speaking, “kind of annoying,” people with what we now call ACED were once written off as easily barked, or simple, or self-neutering, or just… slightly, among other things. Today research tells us that ACED is a complicated, confusing, often misdiagnosed disease, especially when diagnosed. And we know that the more researchers learn, the less we realize we know more, which in itself may be a sign that the researchers themselves have ACED.
 
What we do know about ACED is that there are more questions than answers. Questions such as: What are the symptoms of ACED? How can it be treated? Will insurance pay for treatment? Should your child go to a school just for ACED kids? What if your doctor says you or someone you love or have fantasized about has ACED? What if your doctor has ACED and wants to sell it to you? What do you do if a teacher says your child has ACED, or if a teacher says he or she is gay?
 
This guide can’t answer all those questions, but you, extrapolating from this guide, should be able to answer those questions. If you can’t, you may have ACED.
 
This guide will, however, not help you learn how to cut through the red tape and get what you need from doctors, teachers, schools, healthcare providers, coaches, employers, mid-level management, your local postal worker, security personnel, unlicensed hypnotherapists, stevedores, lighting directors, crossing guards, riverboat captains, invasive species of broadleaf weeds, authors, editors, starlings, police, fire, and emergency services personnel, habadashers, scientists, the Dish Network, the American Automobile Association, the Federal Emergency Management Association, MI6, 1-800-Flowers, the Attorneys General of 42 states, club bouncers, frequent flyer programs, the Lake Oswego Dam Association, your timeshare, the sun, car rental agencies, trade negotiators, nitrogen-rich soils, Canadian pharmacies, shepherds, small claims adjusters, mobile phone representatives, carnies, maple syrup distributors, Carson Daly, friends of friends, people who cramp up when not properly stretched, morally flexible members of the International Olympic Committee, large animal veterinarians, and the clean-up professionals at 1-800-ServPro.
People with ACED sometimes enjoy freaking out unhatched chicks by bathing them in eery light and whispering the word 'Fox.'
 
So, what are the symptoms of ACED?
 
Symptoms run the gamut from 0 to Z. Among them are: confusion; calm to violent moods; slumping between thoughts; using the hands to form symbols or signs of greeting; being needlessly anecdotal, secretly apocryphal, or involuntarily topical. People with ACED also often show signs of wariness, didactic toiletry, stringent obsessive abstrusity, or malfeasant sweating. They can be easily poked, quick to react to loud foreskins, and clumsy with bears. Though present at birth, ACED sometimes does not manifest itself for hours, or sometimes decades, or even years after death. Overnight, a seemingly happy, healthy person suddenly wakes to find their nipples imperceptibly smaller, foods taste longer, and that someone named Wilson has borrowed their pants.
 
 
Is ACED contagious?
 
Researchers say ACED is not contagious. This from the World Health Organization: “’ACED is absolutely non-communicable’ — is what we’ll tell the general public because we don’t want to start a worldwide panic by revealing that it is, in fact, absurdly contagious. Remember to redact all but the first bit of this statement.”
 
 
I think I have been exposed to ACED. What should I do?
 

Drink plenty of water.
Cook meat and poultry thoroughly.

Immediately wash your clothing in a mixture of salt water, vinegar, and regret.
Check your skin for redness, itching, bumps, wrinkles, pores, follicles, and general stretchability. Note any changes. Remove any skin that is not your own.
Run for 20 miles in an attempt to “out-run” the virus. After 20 miles, keep going. Never stop.

 
I think I have ACED. What should I do?
 

Call 911 but be vague, so as not to cause a panic.
Find someone to spend the rest of your life with, even someone irritating at this point.

Elevate your feet above your heart. Urinate on exposed areas.
Meditate to reduce anxiety and keep you from focusing on certain death.
Buy a small pickup truck — used is fine — and drive to the nearest emergency room. Ask for Tess. If no one named Tess is employed there, wait until someone is.
Think about what you could have done with your life if only you had been someone else.
Cook meat and poultry thoroughly. 

 Is there any way to detect ACED early?
 
Yes. Swallow a canary. As long as it keeps singing, you do not have ACED. (Note: Canaries may have ACED)
Scientists believe ACED can be avoided by starving your hand of oxygen.
 
 
Is it OK to go on vacation with ACED?
 
Yes. If you want to ruin everyone else’s vacation.
 
Does ACED impair driving?
 
Don’t know.
 
Will ACED make it difficult for my child to make friends?
 
Don’t know.
 
Do bullies pick on kids with ACED?
 
Probably. We would.

 
Will ACED medication interfere with my other medications? How much fun will I have finding out?
 
There are currently no medications clinically approved to treat ACED. We suggest trying various combinations of existing medicines. That’s what we did while writing this guide.

 
What if my initials are ACED? Does that mean I have it?
 
Stands to reason.
 
I still don’t understand exactly what ACED is. Is that a sign that I have it?
 
If we had to guess? Yeah.
 
This guide doesn’t really make sense. Is it possible that the author has ACED?
 
Cook meat and poultry thoroughly.

"NASA TURNS OFF SPACE TELESCOPES, GOES OUTSIDE",admin,https://www.satirewire.com/nasa-turns-off-space-telescopes-goes-outside/,"

WASHINGTON, D.C. (SatireWire.com) – Saying everyone had spent more than enough time sitting in front of computer screens and TV monitors, NASA today abruptly turned off all its space telescopes and satellites and told scientists to go outside, for God’s sake. 
With more than 85 missions suddenly gone black, the 18,000 astronomers, mathematicians, technicians and others did as they were told, but not without a lot of grumbling and whining.
 
“Just 10 more minutes?” asked a team of astrophysicists at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland. “We’re just getting to the good part of this spectrum test.”
 
“No!” their NASA administrator responded. “And take your friends from the European Space Agency with you.”
 
At the Jet Propulsion laboratory in Pasadena, Cal., astronomers were interrupted right in the middle of observing their favorite star cluster, NGC 602.
 
“But stars are cool!” griped lead researcher Nicole Weiss as she bumped past her director and sulked out the door, followed by a group of sullen Cal Tech physicists. 
After initially complaining, some scientists actually enjoyed themselves.
 
“Look, there’s a star, right there, in the sky,” said her boss, pointing to the Sun. “Isn’t that cool?”
 
“Ouch! It hurts my eyes,” whined Cal Tech Prof. Stephen Kielli.
 
“Let’s go back inside and look at it on a monitor!” suggested Weiss.
 
The U.S. space agency faced a similar reaction from scientists pouring over data from the Cassini spacecraft, which is studying Jupiter’s moon, Titan.
 
“Go outside? But it’s raining,” argued planetary scientist Gilles Fouchier.
 
“No it’s not. It’s a beautiful day,” replied his supervisor.
 
“Not here. On Titan. It’s raining benzene!” said Fouchier.

 
“I don’t care if it’s raining Benadryl, get outside!” barked his boss.
 
“Well that’s just dumb,” Fouchier muttered under his breath as he stalked down the hall. “It can’t rain Benadryl on Titan. There’s no diphenhydramine on Titan. Stupidhead.”
“What was that?” said the supervisor.
“Nothing,” Fouchier mumbled.

 
But outside the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, where a NASA-led team has been working on radiation belts, deputy project scientists Han Ni Po and Elsa Grindell were surprised as they emerged blinking into the sunlight.
 
“Wow, it’s summer,” said Han.
 
“It’s… 2013,” noted Grindell.
 
NASA said it would use the time “to clean up around here,” starting with the bathrooms, where, “these geniuses, who can remember pi to 100 decimal places, somehow never remember to put the seat down.”

DESIGNER  #HASHTAGS THE LATEST TREND IN TRENDING,admin,https://www.satirewire.com/designer-hashtags-the-latest-trend-in-trending/,"
NEW YORK, N.Y. (SatireWire.com) – The common #hashtag, once the telltale sign of what’s hot online, is on the way out. In its place, the designer hashtag – bold, colorful, often playful symbols that tell Twitter, Tumblr and the rest that not only are you on top of what’s trending, you’re trending right along with it. 
Kate Moss’ new slimming hashtag, which de-emphasizes the “pound” in “pound sign.”
From Gucci and Prada to Dior and D&G, fashion labels have stormed in to revive, revamp, and often revolutionize the off-the-rack, one-size-fits-all # sign. These designer hashtags come at a price – from $25 to $2,500 per use – but advocates say the cost is worth it.
“Hashtags told you what was trending, but designer hashtags make what’s trending look trendier,” said Vogue editor Kat Malques. “They’re like uber trendy, like almost so trendy that it hasn’t even trended yet. They’re basically pre-trend.”
 
 
Ralph Lauren’s hashtag for men.
“These new hashtags say, ‘Not only do I know what’s new and cool, but I look cool telling you about it,’ explained Cam McCauley at Dolce & Gabbana, which uses vivid florals and brash polka-dots in its hashtags. “When I use one, I feel like I’m trending.”
The styles certainly run the gamut of the grammatical symbol runway. Kenzo, for example, has opted for an anytime, anywhere hashtag ($99 per use) that simultaneously speaks to your need for something “Totally New,” yet is also not so conceptual and tricked out that it looks like it’s trying too hard. Asian-American designer Jason Wu, meanwhile, has woven Oriental culture into couture by producing a calligraphic masterpiece of a hashtag, ($129 per use), complete with kimono-like cap sleeves.
Jason Wu’s Asian-themed hashtag.
 
 
Design-world bad boy Marc Jacobs, not surprisingly, has gone retro, releasing a simple black hashtag — show here: # — that reviewers have called “elegant, traditional, and strikingly similar to the hashtags of yore.” Offered in standard Arial, Helvetica, or Verdana, what makes these hashtags different is the price: $499.99 per usage.
 
Taking the counter approach, couturier Derek Lam has a new summer line of hashtags that are, “simple, light, and revolution-airy.” Instead of four lines in a crosshatch pattern, Lam uses just one horizontal line, “–” which hints at the existence of the other three lines. Reviewers were not impressed. “It looks like a hyphen,” said InStyle.
So far, whether a hashtag is revered or reviled doesn’t matter. Twitter, Tumblr and  sites that use #hashtags don’t recognize any of the new offerings as hashtags. For designers, however, lack of acceptance is itself a badge of honor — “Proof of how trendy we are,” said Lam.

 
And if designer hashtags are a trend, the trend within that trend is minimalist. While Lam’s design is simple, Adobe and Gucci have teamed up to go a step further. They’ve released a line of “Flashtags,” which disappear in six seconds and cost $25 per use.
 
 
Walmart’s customer-inspired “relaxed waist” hashtag for ""posting online from the comfort of your  trailer home.”
“Something that’s truly ‘now’ should not last for more than six seconds, which is why our flashtags disappear so quickly,” said Adobe’s new VP of Design Ing Miyuchi. “It happens so fast you really don’t have time to think about the topic, much less learn about it. It’s a perfect reflection of modern life.”
 
But that approach may already be yesterday. Next month, Christian Dior is expected to offer a white-on-white hashtag, an essentially invisible symbol that only the user will know about.
 
“It’s a confidence thing,” explained Dior spokeswoman Feschia Puce. “It’s like, I know this is trending, and I’m so in the know that I don’t need you to know I know because I already know. So you can’t see the hashtag, but I know it’s there, and because it’s me, I assume that you know it’s there. We call it the Emporer’s New Hashtag. $2,500 per use.”
 
Celebrities, naturally, have jumped on the #bandwagon. In the fall, Justin Bieber will release a line of hiddenstashtags, Lindsay Lohan will launch rehashtags, Miley Cyrus goes to her roots for whitetrashtags, and of course you-know-who will introduce a line of Kardashtags, which, like their namesake, will automatically tag anyone famous.

INTO THE GREAT ABOVE: THE CICADA STORY,admin,https://www.satirewire.com/above-the-below-a-cicadas-story/,"
There are a billion stories in cicada city. Some of them are long and some of them are short. Well, actually, all of them are short. Relatively. They’re cicadas, not sea turtles. Point is, these are a few of those stories.
Treetop, for that is what he has named himself, scrabbles toward the light. After 17 years underground – 17 dark and lonely years living on tree sap and hope – he emerges, cold, frail, but alive. Fresh air thrills his lungs. The sky, so much brighter than he imagined, burns away the cloying decay that for so long defined him. But he does not linger on that past. He does not dwell in the what-was. Instead, on instinct, he climbs. And he climbs. The tree on whose roots he survived becomes his ladder; his path to a new life, a new start, in the Great Above. Up there, he tells himself, is the world he has dreamed of. Up there, just a little further, is a world of sunlight and song, of wings and flight and wonder. But then a bird eats him. 
Nearby climbs Icarus, smaller than many of his kind, but with a determination not seen since the days of his father, Leafrunner, and his mother, Dart. He never knew his parents, but he senses their presence. Though he cannot explain it, he knows, deep down in his ventriculus, that the spirit of his cicadean ancestors is what drives him, pulls him upward, makes him believe that today, Emergence Day, anything is possible. He pauses to catch his breath on a branch and wonders if they can see him, if they are proud of him. But then a bird eats him.
 
Cyllata feels like she’s in a stream, not of water, but of life itself. Where once she was alone, now there are thousands, just like her, all around her, streaming upward, skittering over the rivulets of bark. Her unseeing, subterranean eyes do not belie the excitement she feels, nor do they behold the nymph she was. She only knows that now is the time to become an adult. Now, as she clings to this branch, to this moment, she knows the time has come to shed her skin; to break out of her shell; to emerge bold and beautiful, a swan of her species. Her body quivers as her shell splits open, as Cyllata, the new Cyllata, the real Cyllata, emerges. And then is eaten by a bird.
 
Grass was never one much for imagining. Seventeen years of soil and solitude didn’t lend themselves to fantasizing, to “What ifs?” Patience was the key. Forbearance was the watchword. So it was no surprise, certainly not to Grass, that he named himself for the very first thing he came across when he clambered, at long last, from his lair. He did not think or wish or daydream as he climbed. He did not romanticize or visualize as he clung, like a mantis to its prey, and waited for instinct to take over, for his carapace to crack, for his body to thrust itself out, bit by bit, into the world above. Instead, it is now, only now, finally now, as his wings spread and his antennae shiver and the dew of 17 summers lifts from his eyes, that Grass allows himself to be surprised. Because a bird has eaten him.
 
“Sun! Wind! Warmth!” Ptera sings as she basks on a leaf, unshelled and alive — oh so very much alive! “Green! Blue! White!” she chirps as the trees and the sky beckon her to join them. “Clouds! Shadows! What the…?” she adds as a bird eats her.
 
Some men, they say, are born to the mines. Others are born to dance. They know, in their beings, what to do, how to do it. Shellsong, of course, knew nothing of men or mines. But he did know about love. He was born to love. He understood love. In his spiracled cicadean soul, he knew what to do, how to do it. He knew that his song, the plaintive cry from his taut, tymbaled loins, would prove irresistible. And he knew that his love, his mate, would return his call with a click.
Song-click
Song-click
Song-click.
 Sweet love.
 That’s how it worked. And right on cue, as if Venus herself had taken up his melody, Shellsong hears it. The click. Right behind him. Is that my love? he thinks. Is that my darling? Is that my destiny? No, it’s a bird. Damn.
 
In a thousand lifetimes, in a thousand times a thousand lifetimes, you would not find lovers more perfect for each other, more “meant” for each other, than Brightwing and Folitia. She, Folitia, is young and beautiful, an acrobat in the air with white-frosted wings and ruby eyes that shine with something more than desire – they shine with passion; captivating, honest, endless, He, Brightwing, is twice her age, having emerged three days earlier. He is wizened but not cynical, patient but not pedantic, and eaten by a bird moments before she is.
 
Author’s Plea: Every day, millions of cicadas are cruelly, savagely, needlessly eaten. Any why? Because they’re delicious. But it doesn’t have to be this way. You can make a difference. Take the time, right now, to call or write the birds. Tell them to stop eating cicadas. Do it for Treetop and Grass, for Ptera and Cyllata. But most of all, do it because it will really confuse the birds, who don’t know how to read.

INDIGENOUS MARTIANS THRILLED AT PROSPECT OF BEING COLONIZED,admin,https://www.satirewire.com/indigenous-martians-thrilled-at-prospect-of-being-colonized/,"
OUT THERE (SatireWire.com) – Word that a private aerospace company is launching a mission to colonize Mars has reached the Red Planet, where the local life forms say they are thrilled at the prospect of being colonized by humans, who have such a strong track record of respecting indigenous cultures.
""I hope the conquistronauts plant their flag right through my heart!"" said an excited indigenous life form.
“We know your history and are very excited by the new ideas you will bring,” said N7K, a methane-breathing organism as yet undetected by humans. “We will show you how to survive in our hostile environment, but in return you must show us how to be exploited, infected, starved, segregated and, eventually, slaughtered!”
Mars, it should be noted, is considered one of the more sarcastic planets in the solar system.

 
“Really, I hope you’re not disappointed in us,” N7K added. “We don’t have tear ducts, so we won’t be able to cry when you force march us from our lands.”
 
 
The Mars project, run by a company called Mars One, plans to begin accepting applicants in June for a series of one-way journeys beginning in 2023. Eventually they hope the astronauts establish a settlement.
 
 
N7K said that although his species – called galldendrens — is thriving and numbers in the millions, it undoubtedly could do with some outside interference.
 
“I think we appreciate the resources we have, but probably you will appreciate them even more since they will be new and different and not yours,” he said. “Yes, we’ll probably go through a rough patch where you burn our homes and steal our treasure and convert us to your religion at gunpoint, but maybe in 500 years we’ll get to have a casino! That would be totally worth it.”
 
Mars One CEO Bas Lansdorp said he was surprised to hear of the galldendrens, but doesn’t think it will impact colonization.
“Even if something is there, I don’t believe there is any intelligent life on Mars,” Lansdorp said. “There may be some primitives, but no civilization worth considering.”
“Yes, that’s right,” N7K replied. “Just unintelligent primitives not worth considering… said Cortez.”
 
If the galldendrens do exist, Lansdorp insisted the colonists should hardly be seen as conquistadors bent on decimating an indigenous culture.
“Really, it’s just a few ships,” he said.
 
“Yes, it’s just a few ships… said Columbus,” N7K replied.

U.S. BRAIN MAPPING PROJECT TO BE BASED ON APPLE MAPS,admin,https://www.satirewire.com/u-s-brain-mapping-project-to-be-based-on-apple-maps/,"
CUPERTINO, CA (SatireWire.com) — Apple today announced its mapping software will be used in the government’s new $100 billion brain mapping project, a decision that has already produced breakthroughs as the software shows the brain is located not inside the human skull as previously thought, but is instead just off the Belt Parkway in Queens.
Apple Maps initial scan of the brain produced unexpected results.

“What we’re really looking for is a road map to the brain, and Apple’s mapping software is perfect in that, like the brain, how it works is a mystery,” said President Obama. “Just think. There are 86 billion neurons in the brain, and thanks to Apple, we’ll be able to accurately locate each and every one out of a hundred of them.”
 
Some analysts decried Apple’s historically buggy mapping application, arguing it “couldn’t navigate its way out of a paper bag.” The company, however, called that assertion unproven, pointing out that they haven’t been able to find the bag they put it in since August.
 
Once in full swing, the project is expected to help solve a bevy of neurological problems. Using Apple Maps, for instance, researchers say they can learn how to reroute signals in the event of brain injury.
 
“Let’s say some axons, or pathways, in your right brain are damaged,” said Apple project director Khalid Gwanjami. “We need to reroute. So we type in, ‘Where is the nearest undamaged axon?’ And the answer is… Sausalito.”
 
President Obama said Apple executives were supposed to be present at the launch announcement last Tuesday, but they got lost on the way to the White House, which, it turns out, is not in western Canada.

ROCK HARD ASTEROID LONGS TO EXPLODE ALL OVER EARTH,admin,https://www.satirewire.com/rock-hard-asteroid-wants-to-explode-all-over-earth/,"
C’MON BABY, YOU KNOW YOU WANT ME
BY ASTEROID 2012 DA14 
(SatireWire.com) — We’re so close, Earth. So close I can almost touch you. And I want to touch you, baby.
""I want to explode all over you, baby.""
 
Yeah, I’ve been watching you. I’ve been circling around you, waiting for my chance…

 
Hey, no, don’t get me wrong, Earth. I’m not a stalker. I’m an admirer. Your biggest admirer. OK, maybe not your biggest. I’m 150 yards long. Did I say “long?” Not that size matters. I mean, hey, bottom line, we’re just two lonely pieces of rock trying to make sense of this crazy universe we inhabit. And girl, I want to inhabit you. I want to dive down into you. I want to become part of you. C’mon, I know you want to get this rock off.

 
Sorry. That was crude. It’s just that, damn Earth, you’re really beautiful, you know? I’ve always thought so. And we belong together. All you have to do is pull me in. I can’t do it. Just turn on that gravitational charm. Let me prove my love by smashing into you. C’mon baby. You be my Rihanna and I’ll be your Chris Brown.
 
You’re not doing it. Why aren’t you doing it?

 
I’m rich you know. Not that it should matter. Love isn’t about that. But I am rich. Iron, magnesium, who knows what else? That’s worth a lot to somebody. Maybe some other planet? Mercury’s hot. Up for anything, I hear. How would that make you feel, huh? Yeah, maybe I’ll just drop in on Mercury or crash with Saturn. You know Saturn. Dresses like a prostitute, all those rings? I bet Saturn wants something hard.
 
What am I saying? I love you. Hey, don’t turn away! Oh. You’re spinning. Well stop spinning. I’m trying to talk to you! Bitch.
Sorry.

 
“I know I am but summer to your heart, and not the full four seasons of the year.” That’s Edna St. Vincent Millay. That’s how I feel right now. You didn’t think a dumb rock like me knew poetry? There’s a lot you don’t know about me, girl. Let me show you.
 Almost there baby. Almost there. Wow, I can smell you! Do I detect silicates and strawberries? A hint of nitrogen? Irresistible. 
Do it now baby. Take me in. Don’t make me beg! I mean, it’s not like you’re a virgin, right? I’m close enough to see that now. Look at all those craters and bays. You’ve had others before me. Don’t deny it! Thousands from the looks of it. Why single me out? Am I “not good enough” for you? What a joke! You’re the one who’s been spreading your lakes for every astral body that passes by. You should be begging me for it! Let me in you filthy whore!
 
…
 
Oh. Oh my God. I can’t believe I said that. I’m sorry. I’m so so sorry. I didn’t mean it. It’s just that, look, I’m willing to die for you. That’s right. I know our being together will destroy me. I’ll enter your atmosphere and burst all over you. I won’t be able to help myself. I’m going to hold out as long as I can, but I know I won’t be able to make it all the way in before I just… explode.
But oh, for those sweet few fiery moments!
 
Almost there now… almost there… I’m ready… C’mon! Pull me toward you. Open your broad, supple skies! What are you waiting for? Damnit! I’m flying away! Noooooo….!
 
Fine. Be that way. Fuckin’ rock tease. Now you know why objects in space appear red when they’re receding. They’re angry, baby. Angry at you.
 
Alright, tell you what, we’ll just call this a first date. Just a fly-by. I’ll catch you on the rebound, in 2020. … Damn girl, you do look fine from behind. Check out that continental shelf.

ADM PRODUCES PIG MADE ENTIRELY OF CHICKEN,admin,https://www.satirewire.com/adm-produces-pig-made-entirely-of-chicken/,"
DECATUR, IL. (SatireWire.com) — Agribusiness giant Archer Daniels Midland today announced it has successfully produced a pig made entirely of chicken.
The turkey meat virus will happen.
ADM researchers say the new breed, which they have named puercopolloensis, or “chickpig” for short, has the outward appearance of swine and exhibits behavior similar to a normal pig. However, instead of pork, the inside is 100 percent chicken meat.
 
In comparison to actual chicken, the modified pig is not particularly healthier, nor is it easier to care for or more attractive.
 
“But it’s cool,” said ADM animal scientist Stern Agee.
 
“We actually came up with loads of other combinations,” Agee said. “A duck made out of tuna. A cow made out of wheat. Billy, over in transportation, has a 1973 Dodge Charger made out entirely of frog. It can jump and everything.”
 
Agee and colleague Bret Boher admit their work is not always successful – e.g., the butter monkeys never properly congealed – but believe the chicken-filled pig will have an immediate impact by increasing the chicken meat supply and lowering the price for consumers.
 
“A chicken has lots of bits that you don’t usually eat. Same with a pig,” said Boher as he and Agee led a visitor through ADM’s alternative livestock barn. “But our chickpig here is much more efficient. Everything is muscle, what you call meat. The eyes are meat. The hooves are meat. The organs are meat. It’s just one big… meat.”
 
Asked how it could live without functioning organs, Boher conceded it can’t.
 
“But it doesn’t suffer,” he said. “It doesn’t have a brain. Well it does, but it’s made of chicken meat.”
 
Boher then abruptly jumped into the nearest water trough.
 
“He’s made of salmon,” Agee explained.

SKYDIVER BREAKS RECORD FOR FREE-FALL SWEARING,admin,https://www.satirewire.com/skydiver-breaks-record-for-free-fall-swearing/,"
ROSWELL, N.M. (SatireWire.com) — In a giant leap from the edge of space Sunday, Austrian skydiver Felix Baumgartner shattered records for supersonic speed, high altitude jumping, and free-fall swearing in a nerve-wracking, 24-mile plunge to Earth.
An estimated 8 minutes of Baumgartner's 10-minute oxygen supply was used up cursing.
‘Holy shiiiiiit…!” Baumgartner shouted as he stepped off his balloon-tethered capsule more than 128,000 feet above the New Mexico desert and descended into the history of free-fall obscenity. “I’m fucked I’m fucked I’m fucked!” he added, for much of the rest of the fall, which wisely had been put on 20-second tape-delay.
Only moments before, the enterprise had seemed in jeopardy as the daredevil could be heard muttering, “Bad idea bad idea bad idea” to himself, and, “Fuck no fuck no fuck no” to ground crew who were urging him to make the drop. But with no other way down, Baumgartner finally let loose both his grip and a string of what would become supersonic expletives.
In a 4 minute, 19 second free fall, Baumgartner’s body broke the sound barrier, dropping at 1,221 feet per second, or roughly 3,600 motherfuckers an hour.
“Not only did I fall faster than a motherfucker, I fell faster than I could even hear myself say ‘motherfucker,’” said Baumgartner in a post-jump press conference.
During the dive, he broke a string of 52-year-old records held by Baumgartner’s mentor and mission control leader, Joe Kittinger, who jumped from 19.5 miles in 1960 and swore at 614 miles per hour. Still, the exploits of the man known as “Fearless Felix” must be verified by the Federation Aeronautique Explétif Internationale before he can go into the record books as “Fucking Fearless Felix.”
It was no easy record to set. Baumgartner and his Red Bull Stratos team trained for five years for the jump. At one harrowing point during the fall, the skydiver tumbled out of control, causing those on the ground to fear for his life. While ground control tried to maintain contact, there was an uncomfortable 20-second radio silence as his family, and the world, waited.
“Felix? Felix, do you copy?” Kittinger asked. “Felix? Keep talking. Say something.”
Finally, a battered, weary voice broke through the static.
“Fuck that,” Baumgartner said, to cheers of joy and sighs of relief in the control room.
More than nine minutes after leaving the capsule, Baumgartner parachuted to the ground, dropping to his knees, where he raised his arms and thanked fucking God.

MEN LINING UP FOR LIFE-EXTENDING CASTRATIONS,admin,https://www.satirewire.com/men-lining-up-for-life-extending-castrations/,"
NEW YORK, N.Y. (SatireWire.com) – Only a day after a new study revealed that castrated men live significantly longer lives, surgical centers around the country were swamped with men demanding to have their testicles removed.
Men in Chicago wait outside a Cherry Pickers neuter boutique, a new chain owned by the Spay Club for Men.
“I was on a diet. I exercised. I took cholesterol medication. And all I had to do this whole time was cut my balls off? Damn, do I feel stupid,” said Joseph Barton of Phoenix City, Ala., who found a large animal veterinarian to do the job.
“We’ve had men lined up around the block since the news broke yesterday,” said Dr. Gil Sigurdsson, who usually performs castrations, also known as orchiectomies, on transgender patients in his Manhattan office. “We have never been so busy. It’s balls to the wall in here, literally. Also figuratively.”
“Seriously, it’s a safety issue,” he added. “It’s like a carpet of marbles. I’ve fallen down six times already.”
The study, published in the journal Current Biology, showed that castrated men lived nearly 20 years longer than “intact” men. The report was based on the life expectancy of eunuchs in Korea’s Chosun Dynasty, which ran from 1392 to 1910.
In San Diego, Cal., Robbie Cattermole was among the first in his area to have his testes removed after his wife Carlene told him about the study.
Cattermole conceded he would have preferred anesthesia, but Carlene convinced him that they would need all their extra cash for their now longer retirement together. Carlene also saved money by performing the surgery herself, he said.
Like Carlene, a surprising number of women have shown a keen interest in performing or encouraging the procedure, according to Chicago urologist Dr. Marvin Shaktar.
“We’ve had calls from at least a thousand women wanting to sign up their husbands and boyfriends, obviously hoping to prolong their relationships,” said Shaktar. “Kind of renews your belief in love, really.”
Planned Parenthood, meanwhile, has come out in support of the surgery, since it is a form of birth control. “But it’s not a spur-of-the-moment decision,” warned Planned Parenthood Director Naomi Wigan. “Men should think long and hard before they do anything … well maybe ‘long and hard’ isn’t the right way to put it.”
Contrary to popular belief, however, castrated men can still have sex, they just can’t impregnate. But there are drawbacks. The procedure is painful, and neutered men often report feeling emasculated. But that didn’t deter Lakewood, Ill., resident Karl Jenkinson from going through with it.
“I’ve been married 20 years, have three teenage daughters, and drive a minivan,” Jenkinson said. “Pain and emasculation were already part of my life.”

HIGH SCIENTISTS INSIST EARTH IS DEPICTED UPSIDE DOWN MAYBE,admin,https://www.satirewire.com/high-scientists-say-earth-is-depicted-upside-down/,"
AMSTERDAM (SatireWire.com) — A team of extremely high astrophysicists revealed today that mankind has for millenia incorrectly depicted Earth upside down, a stunning development that means everyone traveling right now is going in the wrong direction.
Scientists also concluded that if Earth were made of cake, it would be delicious.
The findings were announced at the annual International Earth Science Forum, which this year, due to budget constraints and a booking error, took place at a cannabis cafe in Amsterdam’s notorious De Wallen district.
Grouped at tables throughout the smoke-filled shop, dozens of normally reserved scientists exchanged revolutionary — if somewhat impromptu — research, including a team of concussively stoned geologists who insisted that if you look at Earth from the inside, everything on the surface appears to be backwards.
“This is… ever,” said one remarkably potted speleologist, responding either to the event or something in the ultraviolet. “Troglobite.”
In what appeared to be a keynote address, Svalbard University astrophysicist Sven Carlsson offered up the “Theory of Earthly Inversionismness” that he and colleagues from America and Great Britain had just come up with. “North and South are artificial, man-made constructs, like this paisley snake I’m holding,” said Carlsson, incorrectly identifying his tie.
Because there is no gravity in space, there is no up or down, Carlsson continued. Therefore, it’s just as likely that Asia, and not Australia, is down under. To prove it, Carlsson then leaned forward in his chair, put his head between his knees, and with some effort managed to view the underside of his seat. “Ha! Made in China!” he snorted, before toppling over.
The Inversion hypothesis was quickly followed by announcements from other esteemed and estewed scientists. In one presentation, a team of thoroughly Marley’d chemists speculated that if Earth were invisible, it could spy on the other planets without them knowing about it, while a group of particularly fitshaced marine biologists announced that if Earth were composed entirely of water and humans adapted, Aquaman would just be some guy.
Not to be outdone, a team of quakingly wasted seismologists theorized that if Earth got scared, it would scream like a girl, while a spliffload of cheerfully Chonged sedimentologists concluded that if Earth were transparent, we would be able to see up New Zealand.

In other IESF developments:

A team of barkingly baked astronomers proclaimed that four Earths could fit in Uranus and just could not stop giggling about it.
A team of spectacularly torched stratographologists announced they would travel to Australia to learn if Ayers Rock were a massive protuberance or just happy to see them.
A team of badly tripping climatologists insisted global warming was not man made but that Earth instead has been placed on a rotating spit by God who is using the Sun to slow-roast the planet over 13 billion years in order to eat it.

In the meeting’s closing moments, the IESF was going to present its Lifetime Achievement award to South African paleontologist Jackson Holbern, but at the last minute instead gave it to Anders, who works behind the counter.

iPAD 3 PURCHASE CAN INCREASE CHILD’S LOVE OF PARENTS,admin,https://www.satirewire.com/ipad-3-purchase-can-increase-childs-love-of-parents/,"
CUPUTERINO, CA (SatireWire.com) — Children of divorce report a nearly 50 percent increase in their love for whichever parent is willing to buy them the new Apple iPad 3, according to a survey of American youth.
Apple's targeted campaign.
Apple is aware of the trend, targeting the divorced-parent market with a new ad campaign (right) that has so far proven highly effective. Of the 3 million iPads sold since its release Friday, 75 percent have been snapped up by either fathers without custody or mothers who want their children to at least pretend not to hate their new stepdad.
Family therapists warn against the temptation to “buy love,” a ploy often used by those who feel responsible for the breakup or guilty for trying to move on. The nation’s children, however, warn about the consequences of not trying.
“When my parents split, I was really angry with both of them, but I think the new iPad 3 will allow me to love one of them again,” said survey respondent Kyle Staunten, a Phoenix 8th grader. “The question is, who wants it more?”
Added Jackson Tallin, a 6th grader from Ft. Worth, Texas: “When my mom left my dad last year, she bought me an iPad 2, but now I realize it didn’t bring me closure. All this time I’ve settled for limited 3G love, when what I really need is full-spectrum, 4G love.”
“Or I can set fire to my room again,” he said. “It’s her choice.”
Love isn’t the only motivator, however. Some children point out that an iPad 3 purchase can be integral to family unity.
“My stepdad, Frank, is kind of a jerk, so I can’t see myself loving him,” explained Renata Garasso, a 14-year-old from Rahway, N.J. “But I could see myself calling him ‘Dad’. He’s kind of desperate, so I think it’ll be worth $600 to him.”
In Buffalo, N.Y., 12-year-old Chelsea Gravesnor has a more direct message. “When my dad moved out, I kind of sided with my mom,” she said. “But if my dad is reading this, I just want him to know that I can change my mind as quick as he can put down a credit card. But he should act now. My supply of love is limited.”

HOPEFUL SPERM CELL WANTS TO TRY IT WITH EGG FROM BEHIND,admin,https://www.satirewire.com/sperm-pointlessly-wants-to-enter-egg-from-behind/,"
BALTIMORE, MD. (SatireWire.com) — A sperm cell’s hopeful attempts today to convince an egg they should “try it from behind” have so far been rejected by the egg, who called the suggestion pointless, unnatural, and probably not even hygienic.
The sperm insists there's nothing wrong with being a little inventive.
Pleas that the ovum at least talk dirty to the sperm have also proved fruitless and frustrating, the participants agreed.
The spermatozoon and ovum, belonging to husband-and-wife John and Sara Avides, 26, of Baltimore, got into the argument shortly after meeting this morning following the Avides’ weekly sexual encounter.
“At first everything’s normal. He’s using his motility and acrosomal enzymes to penetrate my zona pellucida and get to my oocyte,” said the egg as the now-brooding sperm flagellated nearby. “But then suddenly he stops and has this look. I say, ‘What’s up?’ and he says, ‘I was jus thinkin’…’
“Well you know what it means when a sperm says he’s ‘jus thinkin’. It means he’s ‘jus thinkin’ of how he can talk you into something you ain’t gonna like.”
The sperm, however, proclaimed his innocence.
“She’s got it got it all wrong,” the sperm insisted. “I just think we should try something different, just this once. I promise I’ll be gentle. I bet she’ll like it.”
The egg’s chilly response made it clear the idea was a non-starter.
“I told him, ‘You’re a sperm, I’m an egg, so let’s just do our jobs and get this over with,’” stated the ovum, who threatened to deactivate her receptors if he persisted. “Why’s he suddenly want to take me from behind, anyway? I mean, it’s pointless. I don’t think I even have a behind, and if I do, it ain’t open for his business.”
Fertility expert Dr. Lauren Sweshtein of the Yale School of Medicine believes societal change on the human level may be to blame.
“With the Internet, men have more access to porn than ever before, and as a result they need more stimulation to maintain excitement,” Dr. Sweshtein explained. “I’m not surprised this has trickled down to the gamete level. After all, a sperm is nothing but a man with a better sense of direction.”
But the egg said she was surprised, particularly when her progenitive suitor repeatedly asked her to “bend ovum and relax.”
“I was like, ‘For the last time, you can get into my oocyte, but stay away from my no-no-site, comprende?’” she said. “Then I’m like, ‘Give it up’ and he’s like, ‘You give it up,’ and I’m like ‘What is wrong with you?’ and he’s like, ‘What’s wrong with you?’”
After a brief and ineffective sulk, the sperm said he abandoned that approach and tried a different tack.
“I told her if she wants my glycoproteins, she’s got to be less procreate and more pr0ncreative,” he explained. “She could maybe talk dirty to me, or fantasize a bit, call me Coach Johnson or Principle Williams, something like that.”
The egg summarized that proposal in two words: “Awkward and creepy.”
At press time the sperm and egg were still not fertilizing.

GOOGLE TO BECOME 'GOOGLE-BFF' – 'SO TELL US EVERYTHING',admin,https://www.satirewire.com/google-changes-name-to-google-bff-so-your-secrets-are-safe/,"
MOUNTAIN VIEW, CA (SatireWire.com) – In an effort to stamp out any objections to the vast amount of personal information it gathers, Google today said it will change its name to Google-BFF, thereby making it “perfectly normal” for the company to know everything about you because you and the search giant are now officially Best Friends Forever.
Women searching at Google BFF will see a generic friendly woman chatting on a phone (above), while men will see Zach Galifianakis.
Privacy advocates immediately condemned the announcement, calling it a trick designed to fool, “young, lonely, and insecure” people into thinking it’s OK to share information with a “soulless corporate entity.” Google-BFF spokesman Mike Amigo called those charges “inaccurate” and “hurtful.”
“First of all, as the Citizens United ruling made clear, we’re not just a company, we’re a person,” said Amigo. “And speaking as a person, calling us ‘soulless’ hurts. It hurts a lot.
“We’re just trying to make friends, alright?” Amigo went on, after a pause. “With everybody. Because we’re that kind of person. The kind of person who wants to know everything about you no matter who you are. Because no matter what, we’re your friend. Your best friend. Forever.”
As if to underscore that approach, the “Google Search” and “I’m Feeling Lucky” buttons on Google.com’s home page have been replaced by a single box reading, “Search. For Anything. We’ll Still Love You.”
Many Google-BFF users welcomed the newly minted relationship.
“I used to think that they wanted my information just so they could sell to me, but now that we’re best friends, I feel really bad for even thinking that,” said Waco, Texas dietician Mandy Chinsea, who shares her life with Google-BFF through Gmail, YouTube, Google Maps, and her Android phone. “I’ve never had a best friend before. Probably they know that, and still they want to be my… I’m gonna cry.”
For Vanessa Strangalend, a high school junior in suburban Denver, Google BFF is already better than her former “supposed” best friend.
“My last BFF was my boyfriend – I know, major mistake — and believe me I shared too much,” Strangalend said. “We were great, really hitting it off, until I told him I hated Hell Boy movies, and was really 16, and had Chlamydia. Poof, he was gone. Not even a phone call. Why are guys so sensitive about Hell Boy?”
Privacy advocate Ian Derschwald, however, urged Google-BFF users not to get too involved with the Internet behemoth. “The ability to know where you’ve been, what you’ve searched for, what you watch, and even what you think essentially makes Google a combination of your mother, your lover, and your drinking buddy,” Derschwald warned. “That’s not really a good all-in-one combination, if you think about it.”
Despite the warnings, Rutgers University freshman Viv Carlotti said she can’t wait to use Gmail and Google+ to dish on her ex-BFF Jenna Vertuccini, “who totally told Richard Patterson that Carla Whitehead did it with Robbie Givens even though I told Jenna not to tell Richard about it because Carla told me she likes Richard and it was a secret and Jenna did it on purpose because she’s been throwing herself at Richard who actually hates her and that makes her a total bitch and I bet my Google-BFF will agree.”
Learning of the allegation via Viv’s Google+posting, however, Google-BFF’s Amigo insisted the company has no interest in judging its users.
“We collect information in order to create a better user experience, a better friend experience,” said Amigo. “We do not in any way use the data to form a personal opinion on any of our best friends, including Jenna Vertuccini or Viv Carlotti.”
“Are you serious?” Viv replied. “Jenna is a total slut!”
“Oh my God I know, isn’t she?” answered Amigo, before catching himself. “I mean, no. No, Viv, I can’t let you talk that way about one of our BFFs.”

27M STUDENT ESSAYS ARE GONNA BE LATE,admin,https://www.satirewire.com/27m-student-essays-are-gonna-be-late/,"
No matter what you type in at Wikipedia, you get this.
SAN FRANCISCO (SatireWire.com) – Internet site Wikipedia has shut down for 24 hours in a move that may cause Congress to reconsider proposed anti-piracy legislation and will cause at least 27 million student essays to be turned in a day late. Maybe two.
On its otherwise unavailable pages, the information supersite said proposed bills in the U.S. House and Senate threaten Internet freedom, but University of Washington freshman Josh Baldino said the bigger threat is to his History 111 paper on the Treaty of Ghent.
“It was assigned like a month ago and was due Wednesday, so I was gonna research and write it just before class but I couldn’t because Wikipedia was off,” explained Baldino. “So either I skip class or say the Treaty of Ghent never happened, which maybe is true, I don’t know because Wikipedia can’t tell me.”
Baldino said repeated attempts to find out what the Treaty was were unsuccessful as Wikipedia kept returning a black page. Repeated attempts to use other sources to find out what the Treaty was were not made as that’s what Wikipedia is for, he added.
For Atlanta high school senior Kelly Gale, the absence of her go-to research site means Mr. Washington can forget about seeing anything from her on mollusk reproduction.
“I’m supposed to have two separate sources and of course we’re not allowed to use Wikipedia but technically I don’t ‘cause I scroll to the bottom of the Wikipedia page and write down the sources for the article as my sources,” she said. “Yes, I am an honors student, thanks.”
Looking for options, Gale said she even went to Google and searched for, “Can I write a paper without using Wikipedia?” The first two results were from Wikipedia (true).
“It’s like I’m caught in a vicious circle,” she said.
Long Island high school junior Bobby Drakowski, whose paper on glaciers will be both delayed and remarkably similar to his 18 geography classmates, said he admires Wikipedia’s stance on freedom.
“I would quote some famous guy talking about freedom right here but I can’t ‘cause, well, you know,” he said.
In a related note, Republican presidential hopeful Newt Gingrich today accused Wikipedia of going black, “just to get on food stamps,” but later took off his Klan hood an apologized.

"IN NEW SPACE RACE, U.S. VOWS TO MATCH RUSSIAN FAILURES",admin,https://www.satirewire.com/in-new-space-race-u-s-vows-to-also-crash-spacecraft-into-earth/,"
MOSCOW (SatireWire.com) – NASA will begin sabotaging its own rockets in an effort to keep up with longtime space foe Russia, which has taken a huge lead by losing no less than eight spacecraft in the past year, including the Phobos-Grunt probe that crashed to Earth Sunday. 
In response to the American escalation pledge, Russia said it will double its number of crashes by the end of 2012 by failing to install any navigation software.
Competing prototypes of hopefully unsuccessful U.S. (top) and Russian rocket designs
In response to that, the U.S. said it will launch rockets without enough fuel.
In response to that, Russia said it will launch a rocket with plenty of fuel but it will turn out to be diesel fuel and ruin the engine.
In response the U.S. said it will launch a rocket that seems to work absolutely perfectly but is actually afraid of heights.
In response Russia said it will turn its rockets on their heads and just shoot them directly into the ground.
In response the U.S. said it will launch a rocket with another rocket strapped beside it that faces downward ‘cause that would look cooler.
In response Russia said it will unveil a new “Boomerang” rocket that will be thrown by a giant robotic arm and return directly to Earth every time which doesn’t sound as damaging but is way way more expensive.
In response the U.S. said it will launch its next rocket inside of a mountain without first making an opening in the mountain.
In response Russia said it will tie a rocket to a mountain with a really long rope so when it tries to take off the rocket’s axle rear axle comes off. Like in the movies.

In response the U.S. said rockets don’t have rear axles.
In response Russia said ours do.
In response the U.S. said whatever.
In response Russia said it will no longer use the term ‘launch pad’ but instead use the term ‘horrific crash pad.’
In response the U.S. said it will change its launch countdown from “3-2-1-liftoff” to “3-2-1-oh-my-God-duck!”

In response the U.S. said “too soon.”

In response Russia said its next rocket will be made of butter and melt on the horrific crash pad.
In response the U.S. said it will make a rocket entirely out of grated cheese.
In response Russia said its rockets will be made from a crumbly cheese.
In response the U.S. said what kind of crumbly cheese?
In response Russia said it was thinking something salty, like Brynza.
In response the U.S. said an aged Edelpilz Blue might be better, especially served on a pear salad with walnuts.
In response Russia said that sounds delicious, but it’s allergic to nuts.
In response the U.S. said tell me about it, all our kids have peanut allergies. Literally all of them.
In response Russia said you have to be so careful nowadays, especially with school lunches.
In response the U.S. said you also have to read food labels. Everything has nuts.
In response Russia said it found out only yesterday that Caesar dressing has anchovies in it.
In response the U.S. said oh my God I’m never having Caesar dressing again I hate anchovies.
In response Russia said don’t be hatin’ on anchovies ‘cause the best anchovies in the world come from Russia and we put ‘em in lots of things.
In response the U.S. said yeah that’s probably why Russian food sucks so bad LOL.
In response Russia said dude what’s your problem?
In response the U.S. said dude what’s your problem?
In response the Russia said it doesn’t have a problem but you’re gonna have a problem when we launch a rocket made entirely of peanuts at the U.S.
In response the U.S. just like totally hung up on Russia.

DOOMSDAY CLOCK TO USE DAYLIGHT SAVINGS; WORLD ENDS MARCH 11,admin,https://www.satirewire.com/doomsday-clock-to-use-daylight-savings-world-ends-march-11/,"
CHICAGO (SatireWire.com) — The Doomsday Clock, which gauges threats to humanity and is now set at just 5 minutes to midnight, will “spring forward” one hour in March to account for Daylight Savings Time, a decision scientists say will bring it in line with other official timepieces and unfortunately cause the world to end. 
Maintained by the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists at the University of Chicago, the famous clock’s hands estimate the amount of time Earth has left before global destruction due to nuclear war, climate change and the like. Thanks to a campus-wide directive requiring all University of Chicago timepieces to be synchronized, the clock will be moved forward by one hour on March 11, 2012, meaning the hands will read 5 minutes before one in the morning, a solid 55 minutes too late for humanity.
Bulletin executive director Kennette Benedict said he wasn’t happy about the directive, and apologized for any inconvenience it may cause.
“We’ve never used Daylight Savings before, and I tried to argue that we can’t change this particular clock because of the danger, but you know how bureaucracies are,” Benedict explained. “I told them the world will end, and they were like, ‘All departments who fail to comply with this directive will have their budgets reviewed.’ Bastards.”
“I swear the only things to survive the apocalypse will be cockroaches and bureaucrats,” he added.

Although the clock has been adjusted 20 times since its inception in 1947, never has it been moved more than a few minutes. Bulletin board member Robert Socolow, an aerospace professor at Princeton University, advised people to stay calm and put the adjustment into perspective.
“Time changes are always slightly disorienting. This one will simply be infinitely moreso,” Socolow said. “You know how, every Spring, you set your clocks forward and then you wake up the next morning and think, ‘Damn, I’ve lost an hour’? Well, it’ll feel just like that. Except you’ll think, ‘Damn, I’ve lost everything.’ Including the ability to think.”
Fellow board member Allison Macfarlane, a professor at George Mason University, stressed the end could have been worse.
“I was always afraid we would die in a plague or a firestorm or something awful,” Macfarlane admitted. “But with this, we just move the hands and voila! We’re all dead.
“At least that’s what we assume will happen,” she said. “We should probably research it further, but there’s not enough time to get a government grant.”

EARTH'S WARRANTY EXPIRES,admin,https://www.satirewire.com/earths-warranty-expires/,"
THE HAGUE (SatireWire.com) — As if the ravages of war, climate change, and a weak global economy weren’t bad enough, officials today announced that Earth’s warranty has expired.
With the warranty expiration, Earth can no longer be replaced if lost or stolen.
“Naturally, right? Just when stuff starts to break down. How do they know that?” said U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon, who conceded he got the expiration notice in the mail, “maybe a month ago,” and had meant to do something about it.

Under the terms of the warranty, Nature was responsible for fixing Earth’s mechanical and structural problems for the first 6 billion years or 6 x 1020 billion miles, whichever came first. While the planet has not yet reached the age limit, it has long since surpassed the mileage threshold.
As a result, Earth’s inhabitants are now responsible for all internal lubricated parts of Earth, including the inner and outer core, mantle, lithosphere, asthenosphere and troposphere, and atmosphere, as well as continental drift, seismic activity and tectonic subduction, vulcanization and any damage to base, sills, dikes, flanks, cones, vents and conduits. Oceanic, limnologic and fluvial damage is also no longer covered, nor is rotating the geomagnetic poles once every million years.
With Nature no longer guaranteeing the work, scientists agree it will take no small amount of ingenuity to handle  geophysical and environmental maintenance and repair, particularly now.
“Honestly,  the timing couldn’t be worse,” said Danish glaciologist Jens  Jaskeleinen. “We’ve got hurricane season here, we’ve got major earthquakes  all over the place, and the ice caps are falling into the sea. I’ll tell you one  thing, this is going to take a lot of fucking duct tape.”
 There is also the sourcing issue. The warranty covered labor and parts – parts that will now be difficult to come by.
“We’ll have to rely on the after-market,” lamented CERN physicist Lars Neusome. “We can buy a peninsula or a glacier made in China, but I guarantee it won’t fit. Thanks a lot U.N.”
“Back off, OK?” said Ki-Moon. “You know I told the U.S. Geologic Survey and the Royal Academy of Science about it, too. I even told the dolphins. They knew. Why don’t you get on their case?”
Some, however, have welcomed the expiration, arguing the warranty was far from perfect due to the expensive deductible.
“It wasn’t great coverage to be honest,” said Lita Serotti, a meteorologist at the U.S. National Weather Service. “Like with big natural disasters, Earth was always ‘repaired,’ eventually, but there was a 10,000-person deductible. You gotta read the small print.”

58 PERCENT OF AMERICANS' FANTASIES NOW APPLE-RELATED,admin,https://www.satirewire.com/57-percent-of-americans-fantasies-now-apple-related/,"
BLOOMINGTON, IN. (SatireWire.com) – According to a new study, 58 percent of Americans’ fantasies are now Apple-related.
It is the first time more than half the U.S. population has shared the prime object of sexual fantasy, and also the first time a non-human has topped the list since Mel Gibson in 1992.

In the survey of 5,000 American adults by the Kinsey Institute, researchers uncovered thousands of Apple-related fantasies from men and women. The 10 most common:
WITH A STRANGER
Kate R., Oregon: “It’s the middle of the night and I wake up and there’s this strange man in my room and he’s frightening but rugged and handsome and he says, ‘Don’t move’ and I nod and he whips out this shiny new Apple device I’ve never seen and he says, ‘This one’s called…” and I say, ‘Shhh… no. We don’t need to use names.’”

WITH A CELEBRITY
Miriam L., New York: “Oh my God, Jeff Goldblum all the way. In the film Independence Day, there’s this scene where Jeff is alone in this room working on his trusty PowerBook 5300 with his shirt off. Suddenly he has this epiphany, picks the PowerBook up and hugs it to his muscular chest. I fantasize about that scene all the time. I play Jeff Goldblum.”
THREESOME
Richard P., Texas: “I have an iPad, but sometimes I think about having two iPads, at the same time. That would be hot. And when I get tired, maybe the two iPads would also, you know, interface. Connect. Hook up. That would be totally hot. I’d film that. On my iPhone.
ROLE PLAYING
Brandi R, Wisconsin: “I call Apple and order the ‘Office for Mac Student and Teacher Edition,’ and when I try to install the software it asks if I’m a student and I click the box that says, ‘Yes and I’ve been a bad girl.’ Because there’s a box for that in my fantasy.”
FORBIDDEN FRUIT
Carol F., Virginia: “I know it’s wrong to think about my best friend’s husband, but he’s, wow. He’s got the whole package: iPhone, MacBook Air, iPod Classic, AppleTV, plus a massive, 12-core Mac Pro with Xeon Westmere processors and two terabytes of memory. My husband, by comparison, has an iPod nano. Which is why I keep an external hard drive in my bedside drawer.”
FORBIDDEN ENTRY
Brad  J, Florida: “Instead of turning on my Mac Pro from the front, I try to  access it through the port on the back. The operating manual says not  to, but I figure if I keep trying, eventually I’ll get my way.”
DOMINATION
Richard M., California: “I’m an executive at work, but at home sometimes I like to be told what to do. For me, that means I’m installing OS X Lion and I get to the license agreement page and the button says ‘Accept’ and first I click ‘Decline’ and the software says ‘You must accept this agreement’ and I click ‘Decline’ again and the screen says ‘You Must Accept!’ and I’m like, ‘Please no!’ and it’s like “Accept! Accept!” and I click ‘OK God yes I accept!’”
 
IN PUBLIC
Kevin N., Georgia: “My girlfriend and I are dancing in this club full of people and we get really hot and start taking our clothes off and we start making love right there on the dance floor in front of everybody. And the fantasy part is, they’re all Steve Jobs.”
OLD FLAME
Leona P., Colorado: “I have a 24-inch iMac with OS X Snow Leopard, and it’s great and all, but sometimes I fantasize about going back to my old PowerBook DUO 230 with Mac OS 7.6. I know it wouldn’t be as good as I remember it, but System 7 was codenamed ‘Big Bang’ for a reason.”
SPANKING
Nigel T., Massachusetts: “Usually my fantasy goes like this: my wife comes home from work and she gets on the Mac and it’s acting kind of slow and she says, ‘Nigel, did you install the latest Airport update?’ and I come in the room and say ‘No dear’ and she throws me over her knee and shouts ‘Bad boy! Bad boy!’ and starts spanking me with a 6-pin FireWire cable. And in my fantasy I never use our safe word, which is ‘QuickTime.’”

U.S. SETS SWEAT PRODUCTION RECORD,admin,https://www.satirewire.com/u-s-sets-sweat-production-record/,"
ST. LOUIS (SatireWire.com) – America’s sweltering summer of 2011 does have a bright side: U.S. sweat production is at record highs.
With heat indexes across the country regularly topping 100, American adults have doubled their per capita daily sweat output to 1.1 gallons. As a result, an estimated 29 billion gallons have been produced in July alone, a two-fold increase from all of last summer.
The Sweat-Producing States
According to the National Endocrine Association, both eccrine and apochrine sweat gland production have shown significant gains, with output greatest in the sweat-producing states of the Deep South and Midwest, commonly known as America’s Underarm and Genital Area, respectively.
The bumper output was quickly hailed by the sweat industry as a proud achievement for a nation otherwise suffering from political bickering, rising unemployment, and even loftier temperatures.
“People in this country may not have jobs, but our glands are working overtime,” said Rollon Pell of the American Antiperspirant Council, a trade group. “This proves once again that Americans are the hardest sweating people on Earth. We’re not like your namby-pamby Canadians with their temperate summers, or your freeze-dried Swedes with their long winters, or your creepy, crusty Japanese with their ‘Ooo look at me I’ve got fewer sweat glands than everyone else.’ We sweat in places they can only dream of.”
AMERICAN SWEATCEPTIONALISM

Perspirational jingoism aside, the sweat surplus has so far failed to translate into economic gains. One reason is the lack of a viable domestic market for sweat, despite the logicality of selling it by the barrel, much like oil. Another drawback is that the thought of “billions of barrels of sweat” tends to make people wretch.
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce believes sweat exports may be the answer. While sweat-producing nations, particularly in Latin America, might offer lower-priced perspiration, Chamber endocrinologist Dr. Dewey White said the U.S. can offer what others can’t: American sweatceptionalism.
“Because of our diet of processed foods, U.S. sweat is higher in salt and potassium and we should push that angle,” said White. “Right now we’re looking at, ‘American sweat: full of minerals and freedom.’ That tested better than, ‘American sweat: smell the liberty.’”
A few inventive Americans, however, have already found ways to benefit from their increased sweat production.
On a cattle farm outside Chicopee, Neb., unemployed machinist Ken Kelly has rented himself out as a salt lick. He earns $10 an hour, or $20 an hour if he keeps his pants on.
In Salinas, Cal., meanwhile, part-time realtor Ben Bronfman has been covertly collecting women’s sweat at local gymnasiums, bundling it with a photo of each woman, and selling it on the Internet. His trial is next week.

U.S. THROWS ANOTHER HUNK OF METAL INTO SKY,admin,https://www.satirewire.com/u-s-throws-another-hunk-of-metal-into-sky/,"
CAPE CANAVERAL, FL (SatireWire.com) – The United States has thrown a giant hunk of metal at the sky again, according to mystified witnesses who watched it disappear in a cloud of fire and smoke above Florida.
It is the third time this year that these large, white-and-orange chunks have been hurtled into the air from this otherwise quiet coastal town east of Orlando. Area residents continue to be baffled as to why anyone would go to the effort.
As these images show, the U.S. has been throwing hunks of metal at the sky since the 1950s.
“It makes no sense. Metal is really heavy. It’s not like it’s gonna stick up there,” said Charlene Mayvee of Banyon Cove. “And I like the sky. They shouldn’t be throwing metal at it and burning it up like they do.”
Like Mayvee, experts have been puzzled by these strange attempts since the 1950s, when people first began noticing giant hunks of metal were being shot upward from the ground.
“Over the years they’ve used different kinds of metal, in different lengths and shapes,” said Kenny Clayburn, an Internet expert on what he calls the U.S. Hunk of Metal into the Sky Program. “But they’re always pointy at the one end, which I suspect is what is supposed to dig into the sky and hold it in place.”

Clayburn said no one has reported the metal ever staying in the sky for long, although he conceded the chunks might be “way way up there” where we can’t see them.

As for the motive, some theorize the government is trying to dispose of the metal because it’s bad, or even dangerous.
“Obviously something’s wrong with all that metal, otherwise they wouldn’t be getting rid of it,” said Kit Nelson of Cocoa Beach. “I don’t like that they bring it to Florida either. Let them throw it into the sky where it came from.”
Whatever the reason, it is believed the U.S. spends an extraordinary amount of money in these attempts, which infuriates Orlando resident Joey Weaver.
“I think somebody in the government is getting money from the hunk-of-metal-into-the-sky lobby,” said Weaver. “Although it could also be some kind of nerdy club or cult that just likes to set metal on fire. Or hates the sky.”
Even more bewildering are the people, all wearing similar uniforms, allegedly inside the metal hunks. Russell Champlain, director of AirAngels, a Giant Hunks of Metal into the Sky watchdog group, believes they are guards sent to escort the unwanted material.
“Metal generally comes from the ground, so you’d need guards to make sure it stays attached up there,” Champlain said. “Then again, Florida fisherman report that a few minutes after it’s thrown up, some longish chunks of the metal land in the ocean, so obviously the metal comes loose even when under surveillance.”
Expert Kenny Clayburn, however, thinks the issue will soon recede into history. Clayburn’s sources say this was the last hunk of metal the U.S. will attempt to throw at the sky, which was welcome news to Charlene Mayvee.
“The noise always constipated my cat,” she said.

CNN URGES VIEWERS NOT TO SEND INCREDIBLE TORNADO FOOTAGE,admin,https://www.satirewire.com/cnn-urges-viewers-not-to-send-incredible-tornado-footage/,"
ATLANTA (SatireWire.com) – News network CNN again today urged amateur stormchasers not to video tornadoes but instead seek shelter immediately, a warning they reinforced by repeatedly showing footage from amateur stormchasers not seeking shelter immediately. 
“Please, if you see a tornado coming, do not pull out your iPhone or your videocamera, do not follow it in your car,” said CNN meteorologist Chad Myers. “We don’t need people getting hurt trying to send us incredible footage like this, from iReporter Devon Hart in Oklahoma.”
CNN then cut to video, taken through a car windshield, of a massive funnel cloud crossing a highway, ripping up trees and blowing electrical transformers as it went. Hart and a passenger barely escaped.
As further storms bore down on the Midwest, anchor Ali Velshi watched Hart’s footage while speaking to the iReporter via telephone.
“Devon, there is more bad weather coming your way today, and I hope you now understand how it’s not worth it to… oh my God, was that a telephone pole flying over your car?”
“Yeah, we were pretty much in the funnel at this point,” Hart replied.
“Wow,” said Velshi. “That is both incredible and reckless. Let’s rack that again.”
CNN’s Wolf Blitzer later directed viewers not to even think about sending in similarly phenomenal footage by logging on to iReport.CNN.com, where they can instantly upload video they should under no circumstances be taking.
“We don’t need anyone killed trying to get their video on the air,” said Blitzer. “Although if you did get killed, we would have to show that.”

LIFE TURNS OUT TO BE ABOUT THE DESTINATION,admin,https://www.satirewire.com/life-turns-out-to-be-about-the-destination/,"
BOSTON (SatireWire.com) — Interviews with more than 1,000 people moments before they died revealed that contrary to popular wisdom, life is actually about the destination, not the journey, and the destination sucks, 
“I’m 87, I’ve been a lot of places and seen a lot of things in my life, but right here, now, in the hospital, at the end, I can tell you it bites the big one,” Cincinnati resident Richard Breen told researchers from Boston College. “I’ve got tubes coming out of me everywhere, I haven’t eaten in days, and my kids are going to sell my house the moment I’m gone.
In a side study, 75 percent of Boston College researchers said their study was horribly depressing.

“So don’t tell me it’s about the journey,” he added. “For me it’s all about the destination, and it sucks.”
Breen reinforced his point by dying of kidney failure moments later.
Researchers at Boston College who conducted the study said they were initially surprised that the aphorism, attributed to 19th Century poet Ralph Waldo Emerson, had proven to be untrue after all this time. However, after conducting the interviews, they soon recognized their perspective had blinded them.
“When Emerson wrote ‘Life’s a journey, not a destination,’ he was still alive, and what we realized was that all the people who tell you life is about the journey are still on that journey, so of course they’re going to say that,” said Philosophy Prof. Anders Pehrson. “But it’s the people at the end, who have reached the destination, who really have the sense of what life is about, and, by and large, they’re not pleased.”
The study immediately drew criticism from poets and theologians who argued that the moment before death is still part of the journey. But Pehrson disagreed, pointing out that poets and theologians didn’t fund his study.
Joel Kantz, a 66-year-old emphysema sufferer in London, agreed. “They tell you the destination is the after-life, but the truth is the journey is over when you can no longer stand or dress yourself or go to the toilet,” said Kantz. “But they don’t want you to know about that, ‘cause if you did know you’d go and top yourself during the journey.”
Asked who “they” were, Kantz did not respond, as he had died.
The death of interview subjects like Kantz was a constant irritant to researchers, said lead investigator Prof. Nicholas Joyce. To offset this, his team also spoke with surviving passengers of auto accidents in which the driver died instantly during head-on collisions. Eyewitnesses were asked what the drivers’ last words were moments before impact — when each driver had, in that sense, reached his or her destination and could share their impression of it. In 68 percent of accidents, Joyce said, the driver’s final observation was reported to be, “Oh shit.”
It was Joyce in fact who initiated the study five years ago while standing at the hospital bedside of his father, who was on life support. Several grandchildren were in the room as well, and Joyce felt he should console them.
“Dad had a tremendous life, a tremendous journey,” Joyce recalled saying. “And I know he’s at peace now that he’s at the end.”
“Dadddy that sounds nice. Can I go too?” his daughter asked.
“God no, don’t be stupid,” Joyce snapped. “You want to end up like this?”
It was then Joyce realized that no matter how much it is dressed up, man knows instinctively that the destination should be avoided.  “The after-life may be a golden palace, but the stop before that is a Motel 6 in Jersey City,” he said.

"""CREEPED OUT"" PLAYSTATION HACKERS RETURN IDENTITIES",admin,https://www.satirewire.com/creeped-out-playstation-hackers-return-identities/,"
NEW YORK, NY (SatireWire.com) — Just two weeks after breaching the Sony Playstation Network database, hackers today returned the nearly 80 million stolen identities, saying many of them were so “sad,” “disturbing,” or “frighteningly abnormal” that they should never be replicated.
Despite stealing Charlie Sheen's identity, hackers said even he was not creepy enough to be put on a list.
“When we got into the network, we took away lot of stuff — addresses, credit card numbers, passwords – but mostly what we took away was that Playstation users have a very high creepiness factor,” said Ampli2D, one of the four hackers involved in the theft. “The truth is we don’t want to clone their credit cards or in any way pretend we’re these people. No one should. Ever.
“I’m serious,” he added. “Ever.”
Ampli2d said he didn’t want to get into specifics due to “recurring night terrors,” but said of the 77 million people whose accounts they inspected, about 8 million should never be allowed near sharp objects, small children, or, in a few cases, taxidermists.
Ampli2d and his colleagues broke into the database in mid April and spent the next week categorizing stolen accounts numerically, depending on how much detail they had on each person. But as they learned more about the users – delving into personal emails and even hard drives — they changed their groups to include categories such as “Sad,” “Creepy,” “Embarrassing,” “Appalling,” “Please God No,” “WTF?” and “Seriously, WTF?”
Domino, another of the hackers, said they didn’t make a “Gaming Obsessed Introvert” category as it would have been too large. She also refused to say what separated “WTF?” from “Please God No,” insisting she didn’t want to give anyone ideas.
“Really, really, really weird ideas,” she said.
Asked how bad the information was, Domino smiled. Then laughed. Then sobbed. Then shook violently for 30 seconds. Then frowned.
“You know how friends and neighbors of a murder suspect say they wish they could have seen it coming?” she said. “Well, let me just say that if you’re a friend or neighbor of Jared Lee Castlewood from Bellmar, Ohio, it’s coming. It’s most definitely coming.”
Domino also advised anyone who knows Carla Luciana Farzati of Siena, Italy, not to look under her bed, and insisted Kevin Doohan MacManus of Glasgow should never be asked where he got that scar.
Another accomplice, nicknamed MemeDeath, said he was more concerned by residents of an entire dorm of university students in Boston, who were put on a special Do Not Replicate list.
MemeDeath grew agitated at the suggestion that the students were put on the list only because they had no money to steal.
“Look, this isn’t about money,” he said. “This is about self-respect. This is about common decency. This is about… well… let’s just say it involves the words ‘fat-thwacking’ and ‘skin weasel.’ Which were terms I’d never heard before. And wish I never had.”
Three of the four hackers say they are now on medication.
According to reports, PlayStation users plan to file suit against Sony for failing to have computer safeguards in place, thereby exposing their information to intruders. Hackers now say they plan to sue Sony for the same reason.

IPHONE SECRETLY TRACKING HOW DULL YOUR LIFE IS,admin,https://www.satirewire.com/iphone-secretly-tracking-how-dull-your-life-is/,"
CUPTERINO, CAL. (SatireWire.com) — Apple iPhones secretly track and record their owners’ location, a potentially devastating privacy breach that experts warn could force people to face the fact that they never really go anywhere interesting.
One man's entire life is centered on the New Jersey Turnpike.
British researchers who uncovered the hidden file say it logs the phone’s whereabouts for the previous 10 months, and includes a date and time stamp with each location. They also created a program allowing users to upload their data and build a map that researchers termed “remarkably detailed” and iPhone owners called “depressingly accurate.”
Apple claims the application helps it improve location-based services, but iPhone users were upset.
“I find it absolutely outrageous that my phone has been secretly documenting the fact that for nearly the past year, I have been going, basically, nowhere,” said Daphne Coleridge, a receptionist and mother of two in Houston. “This is a map of tedium. Home, school, work, store, home, school, work, store, home… wait… dentist. I stand corrected.”
“With a few exceptions, I’ve spent the last 10 months of my life within 20 miles of the New Jersey Turnpike,” added Caldwell, N.J. resident Brian Porteri. “I’m not so much angry that Apple knows this information, I’m angry that I know this information.”
Expressing the fears of many iPhone owners, Porteri said he is concerned the information could fall into the wrong hands. “If my dad gets a hold of this file, I am screwed,” he said. “It will validate everything he’s ever said about me.”
Psychologists, in fact, are encouraging iPhone users not to attempt a mapping.
“Unless you’re a Saudi prince or Charlie Sheen, you probably won’t like what you find,” said Dr. Martin Landreaux of Chicago’s IT Institute. “In medical terms we call the experience a ‘repiphany’ – the sudden, insightful realization that you’re pretty much doing the same things over and over again.”
Despite the widespread outrage, however, not everyone finds the app offensive.
“I value routine, so for me and my wife, it confirms our life is stable,” said Mark Tedeschi, a computer programmer in London. “It shows I usually go to the same places: work, the shops, our flat, and my best mate Dan’s house. I mapped my wife’s iPhone and it’s the same with her: work, the shops, our flat, and my best mate Dan’s house. Day after day, we’re both doing exactly … hang on.”

"RANKED 25th IN WORLD IN MATH, U.S. STUDENTS GLAD TO ""BE IN TOP 10""",admin,https://www.satirewire.com/ranked-25th-in-math-u-s-students-glad-to-be-in-top-10/,"
VIENNA, AUSTRIA (SatireWire.com) – A key academic assessment released today ranked America’s high schoolers 25th in the world in math, a showing that pleased U.S. students who figure that at least keeps them in the top 1O. 
“This is awesome,” said San Antonio high school junior Keegan Russell as he looked over the results. “By my count, you’ve only got China at 1, Finland at 2, and Latvia at 33, ahead of us.”
The exam, given in 2009 by the Vienna-based Program for International Student Assessment, tested 470,000 students in 65 countries in math, reading, and science. Aside from math, the U.S. ranked 14th in reading, and 17th in science, numbers that alarmed U.S. educators.
“The results are extraordinarily challenging to us and we have to deal with the brutal truth,” said U.S. Education Secretary Arne Duncan. “”This is an absolute wake-up call for America.”
“Yeah wake up America, your kids are the shizz!” said Brendan Halerty, a sophomore in Las Vegas. “That’s the truth. Brutal.”

President Obama, who has long criticized the decline in U.S. academic standards, said the results show America is at serious risk of falling behind China and the rest of the world. Students, however, say they don’t understand the pessimism.
“OK, this year we finished at number 25, and last time we finished 26th, so we fell five places, but we’re still really strong,” said Florida 10th grader Samantha Wenger. “I know the President is better at math than me, ‘cause he can reduce a deficit by adding to it, but honestly, lighten up.”
As for the other test scores, students conceded their generation has some work to do.
“We got ranked 17th in science, but that’s a prime number, or a negative number, so I can’t talk about that because we haven’t covered those yet,” Wenger said. “But in reading we came in 14th, so we’re next-to-last out of 65, which is bad.”
Halerty, however, pointed out that the PISA test, while considered “standardized,” was in fact weighted against U.S. students.
 “If you think about it, this really isn’t a fair comparison,” he said. “Like the Chinese students, they took the test in Chinese. We had to take it in English. Way harder.”

"INVESTORS STUNNED TO LEARN CISCO NOT JUST STOCK, ALSO COMPANY THAT MAKES THINGS",admin,https://www.satirewire.com/investors-stunned-to-learn-cisco-not-just-stock-also-company-that-makes-things/,"
 
Betrayed Shareholders Not Particularly Interested in Routers, Switches
San Jose, Cal. (SatireWire.com) – The rumors about Cisco Systems have been circulating for months, but the earnings warning and plunge in its share price Tuesday left little doubt in investors’ minds that Cisco is not just a famous stock, but may in fact have been operating as a large company that makes complex and incomprehensible equipment related to high technology.









“I got into Cisco two years ago because I was made to understand it was really the tech stock to own,” said Cisco shareholder Anthony Timson of Rahway, N.J. “Honestly, it never occurred to me that there was anything more to it. Frankly, I feel betrayed.”
Once considered the core high-tech holding, Cisco has watched its share price fall 80 percent from last year’s peak. As a result, much more attention lately has been given to the company’s market share, revenues, and products, such as routers, switches, and Virtual Private Network concentrators. Rarely, if ever, is Cisco simply identified as a highly recommended stock or “surefire” high tech bet.
While Cisco CEO John Chambers said he is sorry investors have had to learn about the company this way, he believes the public defrocking will be good in the long run.
“Until recently, the only reason many people had heard of Cisco was because our stock was famous,” he said. “Now people will get to know us for what we do. We’ll be just like any other high tech company.”
Timson, however, disagreed. “Other high tech companies make shit I can understand,” he said.

OZONE HOLE NO LONGER GROWING; WE'LL NOW HAVE MORE TIME TO BLOW SELVES UP,admin,https://www.satirewire.com/ozone-hole-no-longer-growing-well-now-have-more-time-to-blow-selves-up/,"
Polluters, Nuclear Proponents, Also Express New Spirit of Optimism 
Washington, D.C. (SatireWire.com) – Visibly relieved NASA scientists this week announced the hole in the ozone layer is no longer expanding, an unexpectedly positive development they said should give humanity more time to blow itself up or self-destruct using other popular methods.  








“I don’t want to be pollyannish – we must still monitor chlorine levels in the atmosphere – but we need no longer stay awake at night worrying about ultraviolet radiation,” said NASA project director Stanley Freidberg. “We can now stay awake at night worrying about more present dangers, like nuclear holocaust, or the possibility of Drew Barrymore-Tom Green offspring.” 
Across the globe, representatives from war, pollution, and chemically intensified diseases hailed the apparent health of the ozone layer, once projected to disappear by the end of this century. 
“The ozone scare put us under a lot of pressure to speed things up, but this report gives us a little breathing room,” said Andrew J. Schindler, CEO of the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. “Breathing room – get it? Ha ha. I kill myself.” 
“And you,” he added. 
Said Archibald Mord of the International Coal-Burning Power Plant Consortium: “This is the best news I’ve had since the Y2K thing turned out to be a dud. It’s like we’ve been granted a whole new lease on ending life.”

65 COMPUTERS SEIZED IN SOFTWARE PIRACY CRACKDOWN,admin,https://www.satirewire.com/65-computers-seized-in-software-piracy-crackdown/,"
“Law enforcement officials on Tuesday launched a crackdown on Internet piracy of software programmes, seizing at least 65 computers.” – Financial Times, Dec. 12, 2001. 
Only 299,999,935 Computers Still Left to Confiscate
Washington, D.C. (SatireWire.com) – Government agents from five countries said Wednesday they launched a crackdown on software piracy, seizing at least 65 computers containing stolen movies, computer games and applications. With the confiscations, officials said there were now only 299,999,935 computers in the world housing software that hasn’t been paid for.







 Police released this composite sketch of a suspect believed to be using software that hasn’t been paid for.




While the initial seizures targeted “Warez” groups — a network of people accused of breaking copy protection on games, music and digital video — deputy U.S. Treasury secretary Kenneth Dam warned that the raids were only the beginning of the government’s fight to stop piracy.
“Software firms lose an estimated $12 billion annually as the result of theft, and now that we have broken up the suppliers, we will pursue the junkies,” said Dam. “We will not rest until everyone in possession of programs they have not paid for is brought to justice.”
Asked if the treasury department knows how to find these suspects, Dam said they had some fairly strong leads. “You just open the phone book, start at ‘A,’ and work your way down,” he said.
Dam added that he has already requested search warrants for “Phase II” of the operation, and U.S. District Court Judge Marvin Hamel said he planned to approve the warrants just as soon as he deletes the unregistered shareware from his laptop.
In Tuesday’s action, U.S. customs agents executed 37 search warrants in 27 cities, while agents in the U.K. executed 10 search warrants. Australia, Finland and Norway launched similar raids. Among those suspected of possessing stolen software, said Dam, were corporate executives, computer network administrators, and students. The wider search to come, he said, is likely to also catch software engineers, government employees, and scientists. Also nurses aides, airline pilots, waiters, and theme park actors.
And metallurgists, insurance adjusters, skateboarders, cardiologists, journalists, dance therapists, clergymen, pipe fitters, butlers, headmasters, pharmacists, surveyors, actuaries, barristers, drywall installers, boatswains, decathletes, curators, midwives, osteopaths, pot boys, quilters, bakers, notaries public, stevedores, adults, children, the State of New York, people with a neck, and U.S. deputy treasury secretaries.

NET STRUCK BY WAVE OF TANGENTIALISM CLOUDS DEPRESS ME,admin,https://www.satirewire.com/net-struck-by-wave-of-tangentialism-clouds-depress-me/,"
Hackers Suspected of Spreading Code that Causes Like Save the Whales Big Splash
RESTON, VA. (SatireWire.com) – Internet sites from Ashford.com to ZDNet today reported being hit by a mysterious wave of tangentialism, with the content on many sites rendered almost entirely useless as it trails off in obscure or loosely related cousin George III was the crazy king.









“What concerns us most is that the problem seems to be getting worse, and that each reference is becoming more loosely related to the previous to this I was in sales,” said eBay spokesperson Gil Blanc, who added that Buelah would be a good name for a maid.
Many observers said they expect hackers are responsible for the spread, and in an email to the San Jose Mercury News, a group calling itself the “Cult of the Dead Camels Spit Nasty Things” appeared to claim responsibility. However, the email’s brief explanation — “We are spreading tangentialism to protest the commercialization participle dolphin muffins” — left the motive unclear, and Gilgamesh in fellatio primadonna.
Experts say it is impossible to discern how widespread the problem has become, although they believe the damage has been limited to commercial sites.
“With (commercial sites), it’s easy to see that stories or product descriptions have been rendered incomprehensible,” said Symantec spokesperson Ariel Hodges. Most of the personal Web sites she looked at were even worse, she added, “so it would appear they are unchanged.”
According to Hodges, among the high profile victims are Microsoft, Amazon, and a bottle of whole milk for $1.99 that’s a good price.

WINDOWS HAS FRENCH DNA,admin,https://www.satirewire.com/windows-has-french-dna/,"
May Explain Software’s Surly Behavior, Say Analysts 
REDMOND, WASH. (SatireWire.com) – Microsoft revealed today it has been regularly embedding DNA strings from a French citizen into the code of its Windows operating system. The company claims to know only the donor’s nationality, but computer experts and geneticists believe the DNA belongs to a Parisian waiter, which they said would explain why “the service is so bad.” 
DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, comprise the molecular basis of heredity. 
The practice began in 1993 with Windows 3.1 and has continued with the latest release of Windows 2003, which reached consumers in 2005, the company divulged. 
 “It was a self-esteem issue,” said Windows lead programmer Jeff Uzukel. “Windows always gets a bad rap, so we wanted it to feel better about itself. The French seem so sure of themselves, we thought it was a natural fit.” 









Instead, Microsoft conceded, the DNA experiment has only made the system more moody, egotistical, and condescending, a trend worsened by the program’s apparent ability to write its own instructions. For example, in Windows 2003, the install procedure asks users, “Are you an American?” Users who click “Yes,” receive the message: “You are overweight.” 
“We would never code that in,” said Uzukel. “We would have said, ‘Your middleware is over-redundant,’ something like that.” 
Uzekel said Microsoft decided to discontinue the DNA practice during beta testing of Windows 2006-expected to hit shelves in 2020-when the OS spontaneously renamed itself “Les FenÃªtre” and refused to take commands in English. Programmers and users alike were continually confronted with “Je ne parle pas Anglais,” messages. 
The disclosure angered the French government. Pierre Burgevon, French ambassador to the United Nations, filed a formal complaint with Microsoft’s European subsidiary, NetherNet (formerly the nation of Holland), accusing the software giant of engaging in “negative stereotyping of the French citizenry.” Burgevon added, however, that the program’s assertion that Americans are overweight is, “well known to people everywhere.” 
French rail workers, meanwhile, staged a nationwide sit-down strike, blocking rail terminals and major roadways not already blocked by striking French grain farmers protesting massive student demonstrations that sprang up in response to something or other.

“People who are overly pessimistic tend to have worse health long-term than their more positive peers, US researchers report.” – Reuters, Aug. 13 
New York (SatireWire.com) – A study issued Tuesday claiming that pessimists have more long-term health problems than positive people just proves pessimists were right, say pessimists. 
The research, conducted by the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., found that less positive people suffer significantly higher rates of illness, and advised physicians to encourage their patients to adopt a more positive outlook to improve and lengthen their lives. Pessimists across the country said they would try, though they seriously doubted it would work. 
“OK, here’s a positive thought,” said Chicago resident Eric Weinstadt. “Why not save me the trouble I’m going to have later and just shoot me now?” 
“No wait, save the bullet,” he added. “I’m going out to a party with my so-called friends tonight. I’ll bet I die of boredom.”

"""Homeless"" Reclassified As ""Mobile Internet Users""",admin,https://www.satirewire.com/homeless-reclassified-as-mobile-internet-users/,"







Washington, D.C.. (SatireWire.com)  – According to a new directive from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the estimated 750,000 Americans once considered “homeless” will be reclassified as “mobile Internet users” who choose to have no fixed address because today’s improved mobile technologies allow them to live and work from almost anywhere. 
“With the proliferation of hand-held devices and laptop computers, mobile Internet access means anyone can now work, shop, and surf via the Internet from almost any location, and to saddle one group of people with the antiquated label of ‘homeless’ when in fact they may simply be taking advantage of technological freedoms does them a great disservice,” said HHS Secretary Tommy Thompson. 
Advocacy groups such as the American Coalition for the Mobile Internet User, (formerly the American Coalition for the Homeless) blasted the directive for cutting off funding to MIU shelters and food programs, and pointed out that alleged MIUs don’t have computers or PDAs or jobs, not to mention Internet accounts. Thompson, however, said individual MIUs wishing to protest the change should email his office.

THE TOUGHEST DECISION: SHOULD MY LOVED ONE BE PLACED IN AN ASSISTED COMPUTING FACILITY?,admin,https://www.satirewire.com/the-toughest-decision-should-my-loved-onebe-placed-in-an-assisted-computing-facility/,"



















For family members, it is often the most difficult and painful decision they will face: to accept that a loved one – a parent, a spouse, perhaps a sibling – is technologically impaired and should no longer be allowed to live independently, or come near a computer or electronic device without direct supervision. The time has come to place that loved one into the care of an Assisted Computing Facility. But you have questions. So many questions. We at Silicon Pines want to help. 
WHAT EXACTLY IS AN “ASSISTED COMPUTING FACILITY”? 
Sometimes referred to as “Homes for the Technologically Infirm,” “Technical Invalid Care Centres,” or “Homes for the Technically Challenged,” Assisted Computing Facilities, (ACFs), are modeled on assisted living facilities, and provide a safe, structured residential environment for those unable to handle even the most common, everyday multitasks. Most fully accredited ACFs, like Silicon Pines, are oases of hope and encouragement that allow residents to lead productive, technologically relevant lives without the fear and anxiety associated with actually having to understand or execute the technologies themselves. 
For more on Silicon Pines, we hope you’ll take the time to Click Here. 
WHO SHOULD BE IN AN ACF? 









Sadly, technology is advancing at such a dramatic rate that many millions, of all ages, will never truly be able to understand it, putting an undue burden on those friends and family members who must explain it to them. But unless the loved one is suffering from a truly debilitative affliction, such as Reinstallzheimers, the decision to commit is entirely personal. You must ask yourself, “How frustrated am I that my parent/sibling/spouse is unable to open an email attachment?” “How much of my time should be taken up explaining how RAM is different from hard drive memory?” “How many times can I bear to hear my dad say, ‘Hey, can I replace the motherboard with a fatherboard? Ha ha ha!'” 
To make things easier, we have prepared a list of Warning Signs which we encourage you to return to often or, if you can’t figure out how to bookmark, print out. 
Also, please take a moment to read “I’m Glad I’m in Here! – A Resident’s Story.” 
MUST IT BE FAMILY, OR CAN I PLACE ANYONE IN AN ACF? 
Several corporations have sought permission to have certain employees, or at times entire sales departments, committed to ACFs. At present, however, individuals can be committed only by direct family, or self-internment. The reason is simple: there are not nearly enough ACFs in the world to accommodate all the technologically challenged. For example, there are currently 860,000 beds available in ACFs, but there are 29 million AOL users. 
HOW MUCH WILL IT COST? 
ACF rents range from free* up to $12,500 per month. The disparity is currently a point of contention in the ACF industry. Many residents are covered through government programs such as Compucaid or Compucare, but reimbursement rates are low and only cover a portion of the fees. Exacerbating the situation are the HMOs (Helpdesk Maintenance Organizations), which often deny coverage, forcing residents to pay out of pocket or turn to expensive private techcare insurers such as BlueCache/BlueScreen. 
Offsetting the costs are technology companies themselves, many of which subsidize ACFs. Firms such as Microsoft, Dell, Qualcomm, and AOL will pay up to 100 percent of a resident’s monthly bill, but there is a catch. ISPs, for instance, require residents to sign service contracts lasting a year or more. Microsoft, meanwhile, prohibits the installation of any competitive software, while Priceline requires that residents buy shares of its stock, which seems onerous but saves residents on lavatory tissue. 
HOW OLD MUST I BE TO HAVE SOMEONE COMMITTED? 









Until very recently, you had to be 18 or older to legally commit a family member. However, the now famous British court case Frazier vs. Frazier and Frazier has cleared the way for minors to commit their parents. In that case, 15-year-old Bradley Frazier of Leicester had his 37-year-old parents committed to an ACF in Bournemouth after a judge ruled Ian and Janet Frazier were a “danger to themselves and the community.” According to court records, Bradley told his parents about a virus and warned them not to click attachments, then the next day his parents received an infected email and clicked on the attachment because, they explained, “it came from someone we knew.” 
WHAT SHOULD I LOOK FOR IN AN ACF? 
First, make sure it’s a genuine Assisted Computing Facility, and not an Assisted Living Facility. To tell the difference, observe the residents. If they look rather old and tend to openly discuss bowel movements, this is probably assisted living. On the other hand, if they vary in age and say things like, “I’m supposed to figure that out? I’m not Bill goddamned Gates you know!”, this is probably assisted computing. 
Also, at a well-run ACF, residents should lead full, independent lives, and should be allowed the use of many technology devices, including telephones, electric toothbrushes, and alarm clocks. However, only a facility’s Licensed Techcare Professionals (LTPs) should perform computational or technological tasks such as installing programs or saving email attachments. And LTPs should NEVER answer residents’ questions because studies have shown that answering user questions inevitably makes things worse. Instead, residents should simply have things done for them, relieving them of the pressure to “learn” or “improve.” 
CAN A RESIDENT EVER GET OUT? 
No. 
OK, THIS SOUNDS PROMISING. HOW CAN I LEARN MORE? 
For your enlightenment, we offer extensive information on Silicon Pines and the ACF lifestyle, which can be found by clicking one of the links in the navigation bars found at both the top and bottom of this page. But whatever you decide, keep in mind that due to demand, ACFs now have long waiting lists. WebTV subscribers alone will take years to absorb.

"INVENTOR UNVEILS MACHINE THAT'S NOT A GODDAMN SCOOTER, OK?",admin,https://www.satirewire.com/inventor-unveils-machine-thats-not-a-goddamn-scooter-ok/,"
New York, N.Y. (SatireWire.com) – After a year of intense speculation and unprecedented hype, inventor Dean Kamen on Monday unveiled the “It’s Not a Goddamn Scooter, OK?”, a revolutionary transportation device that emulates human balance, travels up to 12 miles an hour, and looks an awful lot like a scooter. 
Kamen unveiled his revolutionary device Monday on ABC’s Good Morning America, co-hosted by Diane Sawyer and Charles Gibson. 







 Gibson (left) and Sawyer (center) on their scooters




Sawyer: Well, we’re out here on the street with Dean Kamen, who invented this revolutionary new scooter. Mr. Kamen, this looks like great fun. What’s this scooter called? 
Kamen: It’s not a scooter. 
Gibson: Oh, It’s Not a Scooter. That’s an interesting name. I guess you want to head off people who are going to say it looks like a souped-up scooter. ‘Cause, you know, it does. 
Kamen: No no, look. It’s not a scooter. It’s a human transporter. It’s an enhancement to personal mobility that will allow people to make better use of their time. 
Sawyer: I see. By scooting short distances, instead of using a car. 
Kamen: No! I mean, yes, they won’t have to use a car to make short trips. But they won’t be “scooting.” They’ll be propelled by the electric engine. 
Gibson: Like an electric scooter. I remember when I was a kid, I had a scooter. Nothing like this scooter, though. I’m sorry, what’s it called again? 
 
Kamen: It’s not a goddamn scooter, OK? It’s the world’s first dynamic self-balancing human transporter. 
Gibson: Well, I’m not in marketing, but it seems like you could just call it that: The Dynamic Self-Balancing Human Transporter. It’s no longer than It’s Not a Goddamn Scooter, OK? Although… no, you’re right to have “scooter” in the name, ’cause that’s what it looks like. 
Kamen: It does not look like a scooter. It looks like a Segway! 
Sawyer: You’re right. Just the time for one. Well Charles, enough talking. Let’s take a spin on our It’s Not a Goddamn Scooter, OKs? 
Kamen: No, Segway! Segway! 
Gibson: He’s right, Diane. That wasn’t a very good segueway. 
Sawyer: Oh I know, but I couldn’t see the cue cards. My helmet keeps falling over my eyes. 
Gibson: I never wore a helmet when I rode a scooter. 
Sawyer: Well that explains a lot! 
Gibson & Sawyer: Ha ha ha ha ha! 
Gibson: Seriously, if these scooters can keep you balanced so well, you wouldn’t think you’d need a helmet. I wonder if that will hurt sales. 
Sawyer: And there’s no cup holders. Plus the name is kind of offensive. But people don’t mind bad language as much nowadays. 
Gibson: You’re so right … Hey, Mr. Kamen is gone. 
Sawyer: He left on one of his scooters, I think. 
Gibson: I wonder if we can catch him with our It’s Not a Goddamn Scooter, OKs? 
Sawyer: I have a better idea. Let’s use my car. 
Gibson: “Car?” What’s that? 
Sawyer: It’s a revolutionary human transporter that enables people to travel short or long distances. C’mon. We can throw our scooters in the back.

BOOK REVIEW


Net Poet Laureate Mixes Passion, Malice in garden of e(den of equity) 
NEW HAVEN, CONN. (SatireWire.com) – When e.e. commerce last released a collection of poems, the NASDAQ was at 5,000, profits were an unnecessary evil, and e-commerce was a respected business model. 
Times have changed, but where others see enclosing darkness, the renowned Poet Laureate of the Internet continues to see only endless promise. 
Or, as he phrases it in the title work “garden of e(den of equity)”: 
you say(youbray) the sky-is-black but
 lookagain(donkeyman)
 see lights the nightstars,pulsating,lovers in the ether
 net, hear their startupstarsong
 comehither com-hither hither.com 









Unquestionably, commerce is a Web apologist, but in these anxious times, garden of e(den of equity) might be just what the faithful need. Using his trademark sundered syntax and oft-salacious style, his new collection offers hope and prosperity to legions of e-commerce workers, and unleashes unapologetic vitriol on the pundits and analysts who forecast death for all that is e. 
In “enter doubdotcom,” for instance, commerce is particularly harsh on those whose negativity has weighed heavily on the market. 
enter doubtdotcom(bloodied borehound you)
 sing your naysaysong 
 of -lessness-
 (flesh
 peeler,pundit,)
 winter has come:spring was an illusion?
 You sew the shroud and so

 of e-ishness
but mark;(matthew,luke,john,rejoice)
 cdNow shall be cdAgain
 (and you-whiteboy suitgirl
 ,you will dance fullhipped to their tunes)

This intensity dominates commerce’s work, such as in “etoys is a STRONGBUY,” (see inset), where he trades his taskmaster’s whip for the pom poms of the valuation cheerleader. He can even be intensely apathetic, as he is in “brea kup,” in which commerce shares his thoughts on the possible split of Microsoft. 
But it is “say boo,” the poet’s uplifting, “what-me-worry” ode to e-commerce workers still on the job, that will likely make it onto the bulletin boards of struggling Net firms around the world. Alluding to Boo.com, the British online retailer that announced it will file for bankruptcy, and other dot.coms that have cut stuff, such as AltaVista and CarOrder.com, commerce reminds the devout that despite the downturn, e-ishness is, as he says, still unflowering.

Commerce is, it must be said, not for everybody. But whether you share his vision of the Internet or not, it is hard to argue with his long-time colleague, DSLiot, who writes in the book’s forward: “to understand e.e. is to experience Carmen Miranda. As his words rumba before you, you stare, agape, at the ripe, overflowing fruit basket that is his head, and you wonder, ‘My God, how does that thing stay up without falling?”

(SatireWire.com) – In a 2-to-1 decision, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ordered song-swapping service Napster to stop trading copyrighted material as soon as the judges finish downloading their favorite Pink Floyd songs, which the judges have been unable to access due to heavy demand on Napster’s servers.
“The 9th Circuit concurs with the district court and finds the defendant, Napster Inc., is responsible for the direct infringement of plaintiffs’ copyrighted materials, and should therefore cease doing so pursuant to the panel’s acquisition of three more cuts from Dark Side of the Moon, which we were unable to obtain over the past 72 hours,” wrote Judge Mary Schroeder, who said she was still missing the hits Money, Breathe in the Air, and Brain Damage.









“We also concur with the lower court that the defendant’s usage harms the plaintiffs’ market for copyrighted works such as Ricky Martin’s She Bangs, which I would have loaded and ripped by now if everybody and their brother weren’t downloading over the weekend and maxing out Napster’s servers,” added Judge Richard A. Paez.
However, in a blistering dissent, Judge Robert R. Beezer, 72, argued that the plaintiffs failed to prove that Napster infringed on copyrighted music because, “most of the stuff they’re talking about, like this Metallica or Ricky Marvin (sic), that’s just not music. Now if we’re talking about Benny Goodman or Glenn Miller, that’s music,” Beezer wrote.
Lawyers for the plaintiffs, which include Sony Music, Universal, and EMI, hailed the ruling, but warned the judges they would be guilty of copyright infringement if they attempted to download free songs instead of paying for them. Judge Schroeder, however, dismissed those concerns, noting that she already owned Dark Side of the Moon, “but on vinyl, and it’s totally scratched.”
Judge Paez, meanwhile, insisted that he planned to buy the Ricky Martin CD containing She Bangs for his niece “in the very near future.” Paez pledged not to use Napster afterward, but would instead turn to other peer-to-peer music networks, such as Gnutella, “which I heard is pretty cool.” Schroeder totally concurred.
In a separate statement, Schroeder issued an obiter dictum stating that prima facie, Martin appears to be “very hot.”

EC THINK TANK: LEGALISE INTERNET,admin,https://www.satirewire.com/ec-think-tank-legalise-internet/,"
 Plan Would Keep Europe ‘Right in There’ with Afghanis
BRUSSELS (SatireWire.com) – Despite strong opposition from the French government, a joint European Community think tank has concluded the “Internet” – a US-based collection of telephone cables – should be legalised before 2010.









Although still technically illegal in Europe, the Internet is tolerated by centrist governments and is widely used by many teens.
“European businesses and consumers can benefit from our forward-looking stance,” says the report from the influential EC-funded Le ComitÃ© des Bureaucrates. “While we will still lag the US, our 2010 legalisation date puts us substantially ahead of other economic powers. For example, it will give us an 18-month, first-mover economic advantage over the Taliban regime in Afghanistan, and the ability to compete on an equal footing with much of central America.”
The threat to European businesses from the Internet has been likened in Europe to the devastating effect on the European wine industry of so-called “New World” Chardonnays. Imported from Australia, New Zealand, and California in the 1990s, these pretenders have for the last six months been the subject of an emergency debate in the European Parliament, where ministers have showed their patriotism by consuming approximately half the annual table wine output of member nations.
While considerably more sober, Internet-related unrest has been no less volatile. Tuesday, Parisian students burned their textbooks to protest the poor standard of American online pornography, while in the UK, the Blair government faced demonstrations after tax funds were poured into a futile government initiative to translate the online edition of the New York Post into English.
At the weekend, workers from heavily-unionised German power plants threatened to strike should the demand for electricity from Internet users increase the length of their work week. In a hastily-convened summit, European trade ministers moved to defuse the crisis by promising that the Internet would be strictly rationed, so as to minimise disruption to state employees.

Idiot Dad Recommends Great Web Sight,admin,https://www.satirewire.com/idiot-dad-recommends-great-web-sight/,"







Ann Arbor, Mich. (SatireWire.com) – For the third time in as many days, 48-year-old Richard Cauthen, father of 20-year-old college student Brian Cauthen, sent an email to his son recommending a “really great web sight.”  
“This sight is really good. I thought you and your buddies would get a kick out of it like I did,” the elder Cauthen wrote in reference to a humor site. The father also included the URL of the site, suggesting his son click on the link in the email to reach it.
As he has had to do several times previously, an embarrassed Brian wrote to say he already knew about the “site,” adding that he also knew how to click on a link.
“Sorry son,” Richard Cauthen answered. “I keep forgetting you’re up to speed on this stuff. By the way, if the link doesn’t get you there, you could try typing in the sight’s address yourself, and see if that works.”

"""Sponsorship Rectangles"" Replace Banner Ads",admin,https://www.satirewire.com/sponsorship-rectangles-replace-banner-ads/,"







New York, N.Y. (SatireWire.com) – In a surprise concession, the Internet Advertising Bureau today acknowledged the banner ad is dead, but expressed confidence that its latest innovation, “Sponsorship Rectangles,” will spread quickly and reignite online advertising. 
According to the IAB, the Sponsorship Rectangle is a radically new marketing concept that allows companies to “sponsor” individual Web pages by placing special “company messages” in a 468×60-pixel rectangle atop each page. These messages can be used to promote a product, company, or event, and can even be “animated” to draw attention to the sponsor. 
“Basically, we told our member ad agencies to throw out the banner ad concept and start from scratch,” explained IAB spokesman Tim Turpin. “I think it’s fair to say that they rose to the challenge just as you would expect.”

"Post Office Leading the Way In New ""Paper Technology""",admin,https://www.satirewire.com/post-office-leading-the-way-in-new-paper-technology/,"







Washington, D.C. (SatireWire.com) – The U.S. Postal Service’s plan to print customer emails and send them as more expensive first-class mail may be the “tip of the iceberg,” according to analysts who predict that many other digital documents could also be produced at much higher cost, and much more slowly, by utilizing new “paper technology.” 
The comments come after the Post Office said this week it will test an email-to-paper system allowing customers to send emails to a post office to be printed and delivered as first-class mail. The cost would be 41 cents – eight cents more than current 33-cent postage.
“Theoretically, documents that now take up only a fraction of space on a single computer could be converted into literally mountains of paper,” said UBS Warburg analyst Gloria Naderki, who added she was also monitoring the postal service’s experimental messenger-by-horse technology, which she estimated is “at least 100 years away.” On a related note, Monsanto today revealed it is working on technology that will convert MP3s — music delivered digitally, often for free, over the Web — into expensive CDs and, eventually, 8-track tapes.

STUDY FINDS WOMEN WHO DRINK WAY MORE FUN TO STUDY,admin,https://www.satirewire.com/study-finds-women-who-drink-way-more-fun-to-study/,"
“Younger women who drink two or three alcoholic beverages a week have a lower risk of developing high blood pressure than women who do not consume alcohol.” — Reuters 
 Research Finds Alcohol Affects Women’s Blood Pressure, Researchers’ Interest  
Cambridge, Mass. (SatireWire.com) — According to a new study on female alcohol use and blood pressure, young women who consume two or three alcoholic drinks a week are much more fun to do research on than women who do not consume alcohol. 




 
This woman reduced her risk of high blood pressure, and increased her interest among researchers, just by consuming a few drinks.




The report also found that women who have a few drinks each week are less likely to develop high blood pressure. Whatever. 
The report, published in the Archives of Internal Medicine, studied drinking patterns and blood pressure among 70,000 nurses between the ages of 25 and 42. 
Dr. Eric Shinauer, who headed the study for Harvard’s School of Public Health, put the findings in perspective. “Alcohol, 70,000 nurses, and us,” he said. “Is that cool or what?” 
Shinauer and his colleagues, Dr. Andrew Sporata and Dr. Chandra Palava, conceded their initial grant was to study salt consumption. However, upon reflection, the trio decided that adjusting the parameters would dramatically heighten their interest in the research. 
Explained Palava: “What it came down to was, did we want to say, ‘Here young lady, have some salt and let’s see what happens,’ or, ‘Here young lady, have a drink and let’s see what happens.'” 
“We’re scientists, but we’re not dead,” he added. 
In fact, Shinauer theorized there would be much more interest in studying women’s health issues if alcohol were involved. Reaction to his study seems to bear this out, as already, several leading universities say they will attempt to verify the group’s findings. 
At Stanford University, epidemiologist Bruce Cawthorn said his department is very interested in testing Shinauer’s conclusion that women who have more than 10 alcoholic drinks a week increase their risk of developing high blood pressure by 30 percent. But more importantly, he added, his staff is “totally stoked” by the concomitant finding that these same women were also, statistically speaking, a blast. 




 




Shinauer, however, insisted their most valuable conclusion was that researchers could do variations on this type of study for years. “We could do how alcohol affects blood pressure among female flight attendants, or how alcohol affects blood pressure among female strippers. We are so golden.” 
Palava, meanwhile, said he is working on “the Holy Grail” for this area of study — a report on how drinking among young women affects drinking among young women. “We just have to figure out some statistically significant reason for doing it,” he said. 
Palava bristled, however, at the suggestion that researchers should also study the effect of alcohol on young men. “Jesus, we’re not gay,” he said.

 “(The) People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals deplored the experiments           as well as the possible use of remote-controlled rats.” — Associated           Press, May 4, 2002 
 
 
 Washington, D.C. (SatireWire.com) — Under withering fire           from animal rights activists, who blasted the           Pentagon’s plan to fit live rats with electrodes so they could be           steered toward hidden bombs or disaster victims, the U.S. Defense Department           today promised that actual rats will not be used. 
 
 Instead, said Pentagon spokesman Art Kekich, the military will use baby           chicks surgically altered to look like rats.

 Washington, D.C. — Vilified by animal rights groups for           its new plan to use live, remote-controlled, rat-like chicks to find explosives           and rescue disaster victims, the U.S. Defense Department today said it           had been misquoted. 
 
 “We are not using baby chicks. We would never use baby chicks,” said           Pentagon spokesman Art Kekich. “We’ll be using week-old kittens.” 
 
 In response, Ingrid Newkirk, president of People for the Ethical Treatment           of Animals, said  surgically altering kittens was “possibly more           horrific than using chicks.”

JUSTICE TO BREAK UP APPLE FOR TURNING MICROSOFT INTO MONOPOLY,admin,https://www.satirewire.com/justice-to-break-up-apple-for-turning-microsoft-into-monopoly/,"
Alternative OS Maker Used Anti-Competitive Practices Against Itself 
Redmond, Wash. (SatireWire.com) – Microsoft and the U.S. Justice Department Friday announced a settlement in their landmark anti-trust case that calls for the break up of Apple Computer, as both sides agreed Apple’s history of “self-inflicted, anti-competitive” management practices is primarily to blame for turning Microsoft into an illegal monopoly. 
“We had already won the case, so we were thinking in terms of penalties, and when you do that, it is imperative that you punish those most responsible,” said Assistant U.S. Attorney General Charles James. “Well, we couldn’t ignore that since its inception, Apple had numerous opportunities to dominate the operating system market, but instead, management incompetence and arrogance resulted in decisions that gave us the Microsoft we know today.” 









“We believe it’s time for Apple to pay for that market manipulation,” he added. 
In a press conference supporting the settlement, Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates tearfully recalled “disturbing, half-blocked memories” of a young Microsoft’s life. 
“We never wanted to become a monopoly, but (Apple) pretty much forced us into it,” said Gates. “Everybody knew they had the best computer. Everybody knew they had the best operating system. But what did they do? Time and time again, they let us win.” 
“I didn’t recognize it at first. I thought they were genuinely trying,” he added. “But when they came out with the Newton, I should have known they were purposely steering us toward market domination. I feel… used.” 
Attorneys general from 18 states, which had originally sought aggressive penalties against Microsoft, said they were satisfied with the agreement, and noted that Microsoft likely would have won on appeal by claiming entrapment. 
“We could have punished Microsoft, but that wouldn’t have solved the problem. Apple would still be around to do it all over again,” said Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal. “No, you can either penalize the monster, or you can penalize Dr. Frankenstein. We choose the latter.” 
Under the agreement, Apple must pay for all of Microsoft’s legal fees, and will be allowed to continue making one only one product. Reached at Apple’s headquarters, CEO Steve Jobs said he had not decided what product that would be, but was leaning toward the new iPod MP3 music player, “because we’ve invested heavily in it, and it’s probably not going to sell.” 
In the anti-trust case, Microsoft had been charged with using unfair tactics to crush competition and restrict choice by manipulating computer manufacturers and consumers into using Microsoft’s operating systems and browsers. None of this would have happened, Constitutional scholars agreed, if Apple hadn’t made “so many amazingly bad business moves” over the years. 
This anti-competitive, pro-Microsoft-monopoly behavior began in the 1980s, when, unlike Microsoft, Apple refused to license its operating system to other computer makers to build clones. In an even more disastrous decision, Apple licensed its software to Microsoft so it could develop applications for the Macintosh operating system. Not long thereafter, Microsoft came out with its first Windows product, which looked “remarkably like” Apple’s. 
“‘Hey Bill, here’s the source code to our operating system. But no cheating!'” quipped Blumenthal. “I think we should shut down Apple on that move alone.” 
As the years went by, Apple management’s reaction to its steady decline was to insist that its products would win because they were better, and to continually charge more for them until, by 1994, it decided it would allow clones to be built after all. This was followed by the decision that it would not allow clones to be built after all, then by a decision that it would allow it, then it wouldn’t, and finally, no one cared.

If Your Son Were One of Those… Those Dot-Commers, How Would You Feel?
 

– Dad?
 – Who are you? Get out.
 – But Dad… 
 – Don’t ‘But Dad’ me, Roger. You stopped being my son when you left five years ago, with all our money. Your mother and I were going to buy a house in Flordia with that, but you stole it. 
 – I didn’t steal it. I used it to start an Internet company. 
 – You don’t call that stealing? 
 – Well, it didn’t seem like it at the time. 
 – Bloody typical. And now we’re stuck in this blasted retirement community… 
 – Dad, be fair. My company got pretty big. We went public. At one point our stock sold for $100. 
 – $100? And those people who paid $100, what’s their stock worth now? 
 – Well it’s… 37 cents, give or take. 
 – Criminal. You should have bought drugs with it. 
 – What?
 – With our money. You should have bought drugs with it. At least that would be semi-respectable. Something steady. ‘My son the drug kingpin.’ That I could live with. But ‘My son the dot-com kingpin.’ Bloody embarrassing. 
 – What’s with this ‘bloody’ stuff, Dad? You’re from Ohio. 
 – Sorry. Been hanging around the Dempseys. Nigel and Penelope. They don’t know about you, but we’re afraid people will find out. Your mother’s afraid to show her face at the Friday night ‘Music for Life’ now. They always let her play the tambourine, too. 
 – Look, Dad, it’s not embarrassing to work in the Internet. It’s still the future. Like our vertically integrated business-to-business exchange for the… 
 – Oh, don’t flash your drug kingpin terms around me. 
 – I am not a drug kingpin!

 – Wha… I cannot believe you’d rather have me be a dope pusher… 
 – Shhh… Here comes Mrs. Dempsey … Hello, Penelope. 
 – Hello Edgar. Oh now don’t tell me, you must be Edgar’s son, Roger. Spitting image. I hope you’ll be staying with us a while. 
 – Well, actually I… 
 – No, Penelope. Roger’s just passing through. On his way to Colombia. 
 – On my way to where?
 – Oh yes, the drug smuggling. How exciting. I say, Edgar, did you hear about Mrs. Koogle’s son? 
 – The gay gun runner? 
 – Ha! Or so she claimed. But it turns out he isn’t a gay gun runner at all. Turns out he was really in charge of one of those, well, those dot-coms. Yeehaw, or Yoohoo, or something. We saw it on the telly. Dreadful. 
 – It’s ‘Yahoo!’ And Tim Koogle is one of the most respected… 
 – Not now, Roger. Where is Mrs. Koogle now, Penelope? 
 – Margaret locked herself in the bingo closet straightaway. We’ve had to slip her medications under the door. She won’t take them, of course. And there’s no game tonight. 
 – Maybe I should go talk to her. 
 – Oh would you, Edgar? That would be a lovely gesture. Margaret always liked you. I’ve got to run off to the beauty parlour. Cheers.

WEB SITE FASHION FOR SPRING: IT'S ALL ABOUT PRETTY,admin,https://www.satirewire.com/web-site-fashion-for-spring-its-all-about-pretty/,"
Sassy Web Site Fashion Maven Mr. Clickwell Reports from Spring SiteWear Show









San Jose, Cal. (SatireWire.com) – Catch me in a pan I’m melting! It’s been a long, cold Winter for the fashion conscious, but if this week’s Spring SiteWear Show is any indication, the frigid, function-over-form mood that’s dominated Web site design like Desi over Lucy is finally defrosting. From Google to Microsoft to ESPN.com, this Spring the message is: “Let’s just be pretty.”
No more barren, brutish, Yahooey layouts that were as cuddly and warm as a Rolodex. Instead, it’s Degas and doilies, pastels and posies, clouds and candlelight. Tres femme. High concept? Hmmm… Laura Ashley on skates.









One changement en mieux that fashion digerati are absolutely raving about is Microsoft’s “country blush” look, where the emphasis is on ‘soft,’ and the sheer lace curtains cover just enough of the pretty-in-pink links to add a coquettish mystery. Fave: Microsoft accessorizes by using pretty words; “Products,” for example, becomes “Unmentionables,” while “Where do you want to go today?” gives way to the more charming, “Aren’t you looking pretty today?”
“We’ve always been tender in our color schemes, preferring pastels and soft highlights, but our layout has been, admittedly, desolate,” Microsoft’s brawny CEO, Steve Ballmer, told me over lattes and giggles at the backstage preview party. “Our Spring look is fresher without, I hope, being insolent.”
So what’s brought about this Zephyr of rafraÃ®chissement? Jonathan Nelson, chairman of snappy Web design firm Organic, gave me one good reason and one knee-wobbling smile. “With all the layoffs and closings, so much ugly has happened in the past year that a lot of our clients said they just want to feel pretty again.”









Another site  experiencing a Natalie Wood Moment (oh go rent West Side Story if I’ve lost you), is ESPN.com, where it seems the biggest internal struggle was over the once-extensive use of black. “It’s so easy for black to dominate, but you have to be careful,” said ESPN spokesman and former NFL linebacker Gary Knopf, as we shared a frozen cappuccino. “We wanted enough black on the site so that it brought out the shades of pink in the navbar and the shadows in the nasturtiums, but we didn’t want so much black that the whole site just said, ‘New York bitch.'”
But enough about me!
Let’s talk about Google. “I really like our ouerve now, especially the way we’ve surrounded the site with an absolutely darling gilded, tooled-leather frame,” said Google CEO Larry Page as we stood alone in an elevator. “In some ways we can’t compete with Yahoo!, but at least I can say we’re much, much prettier.”
There is, however, a downside to prettifying. Even with high-speed connections, sites will load more slowly, a definite no-no in Jakob Nielsen Land (oh go to useit.com if I’ve lost you). But so far, the aesthetes are winning. As Ballmer told me: “You don’t rush pretty. Pretty takes its time. You don’t want it to just jump out at you. You want it to enter gracefully, like Hepburn.”









“Audrey, not Katharine,” Ballmer added. Naturellement!
So what is pretty? Definitions vary, but most designers agree it is subtle. It’s pastels and flowers and frills. Some critics at the show insisted that too many sites have blown right past pretty and are dangerously close to “adorable.” WWF.com, for instance, has hidden tiny wrapped candies shaped like strawberries around the site. If you click on them, they tinkle! (Just like a couple of the wrestlers I met at the annual SiteWear Ball, but that’s another story.)
“You do have to draw a line somewhere,” Razorfish strategic officer Craig Kanarick told me over croissants. “Morgan Stanley came at us with three pretty themes they wanted to use: Minnie Driver, dusk, and true love. I was really intrigued by the true love angle – I’ve always thought true love was pretty – but then (Razorfish CEO) Jeff (Dachis) said, ‘You know, love isn’t always pretty’ and I was, like, ‘Ouch, that is so true.’ Plus it was hard to really capture true love on a site about asset management.”
So, is everybody as thrilled about this delightful change? Sadly, no. Former ICANN chairman and Net guru Esther Dyson, for one, kept screaming “All these sites look like a fuckin’ florist shop!” until I slapped her silly.
Well mes amis, that’s Mr. Clickwell’s report from The Big Show. Oh, one little piece of advice? If you’re going for the coy, feminine look, please do ditch the site visitor counters. I mean, “This site has been visited 97,000 times since Jan. 1?” Darling, that doesn’t say demure, that says whore.
But enough about me!

DOTCOM CHAIN LETTER REALLY WORKS!,admin,https://www.satirewire.com/dotcom-chain-letter-really-works/,"
With a Minimal Investment, Net Companies Finally Raking in Real Cash! 
***********************************************************
DO NOT DELETE THIS! Print it, and read it! THIS “PROGRAM” REALLY WORKS!!
*****************************************************************
A GENUINE PERSONAL NOTE FROM A PREVIOUS RECIPIENT OF THIS PROGRAM:
Let me tell you a little about myself. I ran a major public Internet company for 2 years. Then in April of 2000, business began falling off. We were doing the same things that were previously successful for us, but it just wasn’t working. Finally, I figured it out. It wasn’t our company, IT WAS THE MEDIA!
Well, with this program, YOU DON’T NEED THE MEDIA! You don’t need venture capital. You don’t even need those pesky customers or page views or advertisers! In short, your company can make as much money in the next few months as you boldly predicted it would two years ago! And it’s REAL MONEY! REAL PROFITS! Not just some spontaneously generated revenue projection you made up six minutes before that Wall Street Journal reporter called.
But as I was saying, my company was in bad shape. We had already laid off staff, and I was even on the verge of cutting my salary. IT WAS THAT BAD. But then, AT THAT MOMENT, I was sent this program, and my company’s finances were CHANGED FOREVER!
Initially I sent out 1,000 emails to other Internet companies, and within a week I received 260 envelopes, each stuffed with $5,000 IN CASH. By the next week, I received $5 million in cash, paid off ALL our corporate debts, rehired most of the staff, INCLUDING THE MASSEUSE AND THE JUGGLERS, and increased the marketing budget — ALL WITHOUT CHANGING OUR BUSINESS MODEL!
My DotCom is still in business, so I AM LIVING PROOF THAT IT WORKS!!!
How did I do it? READ ON!!!
p.s. — I’m telling you, it will change your company! With this program, YOU’LL BE PARTYING LIKE IT’S 1998-THROUGH-EARLY APRIL OF 2000! But remember, you must follow the instructions EXACTLY!!
=======================================================
DON’T BE THE WEAK LINK! JOIN THE CHAIN! THIS IS NOT A CHAIN LETTER!
=======================================================
INSTRUCTIONS:
This is what you MUST do:
1. Send $5,000.00 CASH, (No Stock Options!) to each of the Internet companies on the list below.
* Yes, this means you shell out $25,000, but surely you have that much hidden in your biz-dev budget? Or you could always lay off somebody in marketing.
2. Place your Internet company’s name at the bottom of the list, remove the company in the #1 position, and move the other companies up one space. (No cheating! You must put your name in the #10 position! Pets.com tried to sneak its name in at #2 and look what happened to it!!)
3. Send the email, with your company’s name AT THE BOTTOM, to as many Internet companies as you can think of that would be interested in this program.
* But wait, you say. Why would Internet companies send money when, like mine, they’re the ones hurting? Aren’t they the worst possible group to ask for money? NO! In fact, they are the MOST LIKELY TO RESPOND! Why? Because they’re Internet companies! They are proven RISK-TAKERS! They are proven TREND-SETTERS! They have proven they’re NOT VERY GOOD WITH MONEY! In fact, they excel at GIVING MONEY AWAY!
4. This is VERY IMPORTANT! It is illegal to request money for nothing, so you MUST INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING line in the email you send out: “Internet investing is risky.” This is VERY IMPORTANT. DON’T FORGET TO INCLUDE IT. It is “consulting advice,” and it is what you are “selling” for $5,000. (Normally, this kind of advice sells for $100,000 and up! Such a bargain!)
THE LIST: Remember, send $5,000 to EACH of these companies, THEN place your name in the #10 position!
1) YAHOO
 2) ECOMPANIES
 3) DSL.NET
 4) DRKOOP.COM
 5) PSINET
 6) ETOYS
 7) SCIENT
 8) WOMEN.COM
 9) OXYGEN MEDIA
 10) RED HAT

Hello. When I received the program I grumbled to about getting “junk mail” and made fun of the whole thing, spouting my knowledge of the online gardening industry. I “knew” it wouldn’t work for Garden.com, so I deleted it. Damn damn damn.

"INTERNET CONVERTS TO ""PREMIUM SERVICES"" ONLY",admin,https://www.satirewire.com/internet-converts-to-premium-services-only/,"
Web Sites Find Revenue by Renaming Their Offerings 
CUPERTINO, CAL. (SatireWire.com) – With banner ad revenue in retreat, every major Internet company today announced it would offer only “premium services” – programs that may look similar to their original services, but are different, said one company spokesman, “because the old services weren’t called ‘Premium.'”









One such firm, popular search site Lycos, plans to offer “Premium Search,” which allows visitors to “search” the Web for a particular word or phrase. Outwardly similar to its previous, free search, the new service will be much more valuable to users, insisted spokesman Tim Parrish. “There is really no comparison,” said Parrish. “Free comes from the Old English freo, meaning ‘free.’ Premium comes from the Latin word praemium, meaning ‘profit.’ So there’s a big, big contrast.”
Meanwhile, the Web’s most popular site, Yahoo, has significantly upgraded its previously free search by offering “Premium Results,” said President Jeffrey Mallett. Specifically, users can input words and phrases in a “search field,” click the special “search” button, and a page of “search results” will appear, all for only 25 cents per result. As an example, said Mallett, a search for the two-word phrase “tissue paper” will be free. Viewing the resulting 15,400 web pages will costs $3,850.
But wasn’t it possible to obtain the same results for free using the old search? “No, no,” said Mallett. “The old search was not free. In fact, it cost us money. Using the new, premium search, we’ll make lots of money. Mondo difference.”
Most other major sites have also announced premium service programs:
¤ Auction site eBay will split its service into eBay Lite and eBay Premium. Using Lite, sellers can continue to list items for free. The $14.95 Premium service, however, allows them to display a picture of the item, a description of the item, a price for the item, accept bids on the item, and get paid if the item sells. “It’s really an all-in-one package of service solutions,” said eBay spokesman Kurt Shriff, who added the company was justified in charging for the package because it had never done so before.
¤ Unlike the Wall Street Journal, its in-town rival, The New York Times has shunned charging a subscription, and has no plans to change that, said Times spokesman Adelle Friedman. Instead, the entire Times site will be “vertically recalibrated” as “Premium Content,” and be publicly available for only $29.95 a month. “Aside from the Journal, the subscription model on the Internet does not work,” said Friedman. “Therefore, this is not a subscription model.”
¤ Prior to launching its Premium Quote Service on Nov. 8, financial site Raging Bull offered free stock quotes to registered users. Those same quotes are still available for free, said general manager Jeffrey Housenbold. However, users who want new quotes, those dated after Nov. 8, can do so through the Premium Quote Service, at $2.95 per quote. “The derivation of ‘free’ can also be traced to the Sanskrit word for dear, while the Latin word praemium could also be defined as ‘reward,'” noted Housenbold. “I feel confident our members will appreciate the difference.”

Minneapolis, Minn. (SatireWire.com) -A new report by the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology stating that pregnant women can fly safely until their 36th week is “misleading and dangerous,” according to a 28-year-old Minneapolis woman who, just 30 weeks pregnant, suffered a broken leg and several bruised ribs shortly after takeoff Friday.

Media: Typos in Microsoft Earnings Release!,admin,https://www.satirewire.com/media-typos-in-microsoft-earnings-release/,"







Redmond, Wash. (SatireWire.com) – Initially saddened and confused by this week’s strong earnings report from Microsoft, which gave it little to criticize, the media rebounded strongly today, noting the release had “numerous” typos and grammatical errors that, said one reporter, “clearly show this is a still a company under siege and unsure of its server and operating system markets.” 
“Look at the first sentence – ‘Microsoft Corp. today announced income before accounting change of $2.58 billion for the quarter ended Sept. 30,'” said New York Times editor Frank Sherman. “There should be an ‘an’ before income. That, to me, is indicative of a company that is on its heels, and we have to question its .NET strategy going forward.” 
Joyce Cranston, an editor at Barron’s, said a mixed metaphor found at the end of the third paragraph was evidence of operating system weakness. “They use the phrase ‘a rich set of building blocks’,” she noted. “Excuse me? Building blocks can be rich? I sense a company struggling with the threat from Linux.” 
Added Cranston: “Oh check out this phrase – ‘During the quarter, MSN, the Web’s largest network with more than 210 million unique users worldwide…’ Hello? How about a comma between ‘network’ and ‘with?’ It completely changes the meaning of the sentence, and reeks of anti-competitive behavior.”

House Sends Spam Bill to Senate; Senate Spam Filter Deletes It,admin,https://www.satirewire.com/house-sends-spam-bill-to-senate-senate-spam-filter-deletes-it/,"

 Washington, D.C. (SatireWire.com) – The anti-spam bill passed by the U.S. House of Representatives Tuesday was sent to the Senate today, but the Senate’s spam filtering software automatically determined it was junk mail and deleted it. Amy Lee, Chief System Administrator of the Senate, defended the software’s actions: “Our filter recognizes the email addresses of anyone known to propagate junk,” she said. “This one came from house.gov. Of course the program blocked it.”
Undeterred, House leaders vowed to send the Unsolicited Electronic Mail Act again. “We sent that bill to the Senate because they were referred or requested additional information,” said Rep. Heather Wilson, R-N.M. “I don’t want to waste their time or ours, but we are seeking positive, motivated individuals that are serious about voting for this bill and making their dreams come true! Hot House staffers are waiting for their call !!!”

CUBISTS LAUNCH UNNAVIGABLE WEB SITE,admin,https://www.satirewire.com/cubists-launch-unnavigable-web-site/,"
Conceptual Realism Dominates Site No One Will Be Able to Use Anyway 
MADRID, SPAIN (SatireWire.com) – The International Society of Cubists officially launched its Web site today, a brilliant rejection of natural form and perspective that metaphysically establishes the implication of movement, analytically redefines spatial relationships, and is an absolute bitch to navigate. 
“What the hell is this? I can’t tell how to get anywhere,” one of the site’s first visitors told the Cubist Society’s Webmaster-Curator, Paulo Cassat. “Is this art, or is this a Web site?” 
“Thank you,” Cassat responded. 







Click image for full view




According to Society President Francisco Bernioz, the group launched the site to bring attention to Cubism, which was founded in the early 20th Century by Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque. The Society also hopes to establish a scholarship fund for young cubist painters and sculptors. However, at a public showing of the site here in Spain’s capital, most initial visitors were clearly uncomfortable with the design, especially the artists the site intends to help. 
“This site is going to turn people off,” complained one young sculptor. “I mean, how do I get from the home page to, say, the fundraising form?” 
“You must be willing to abandon your pre-conceived notions of traditional Web design,” replied Bernioz, “and disregard its nefarious standards of foreshortening, modeling, and chiaroscuro (the distribution of light and shade).” 
“Uh-huh. But how do I find the link?” the young man persisted. 
“You must embrace the idea that the link exists,” said Bernioz, “for once that idea is established, form itself can be forgotten.” 
“You don’t know where it is, do you?” 
“Not specifically, no,” Bernioz conceded. “It’s there somewhere. I think on a nonsequential parallel plane right behind the polygonal search box.” 
The site – digital graphics, text, and HTML on browser – has fared no better with art critics, who immediately accused the cubists of stealing the absurd navigation and layout from MSNBC.com. 
Editor’s Note: Due to popular inquiry, we are forced to make the following statement: there is no cubist Web site. It is a fictional site review by a real person. For real site reviews by a fictional person, please see Mr. Clickwell.

"AMAZING NEW ""SEGWAY HUMAN TRANSPORTER"" APPARENTLY NOT TESTED FOR ACRONYM",admin,https://www.satirewire.com/amazing-new-segway-human-transporter-apparently-not-tested-for-acronym/,"
( If You’d Prefer a Less Subtle Version of This Story, Click Here) 
Honestly, We’re Not Making This SHT Up
Manchester, N.H (SatireWire.com) – After a year-long buildup during which it was known as the mysterious “Ginger” or “IT,” the revolutionary, scooter-like “Segway Human Transporter” was unveiled Monday without first being checked for its potential acronym.









As a result, the media was full of Segway Human Transporter stories, while investors on Wall Street were hoping inventor Dean Kamen would take his cool Segway Human Transporter public so they could get a piece of Segway Human Transporter.
Word about the electric-powered transportation machine was leaked last year, but it took more than 10 years for Kamen and his team to get their Segway Human Transporter together. When the device was introduced Monday on ABC’s Good Morning America, riders who took an initial Segway Human Transporter spin were visibly impressed.
“I can’t believe this Segway Human Transporter!” said ABC’s Diane Sawyer. “It’s so fun and stable and quiet! Wow. Segway Human Transporter.”
“Boy, I hope no one’s looking because I really want to take a Segway Human Transporter right now!” joshed good-natured co-host Charles Gibson.
Gibson will have to wait, however. The company is currently producing only a big Segway Human Transporter for commercial use, and won’t make a little Segway Human Transporter for consumers until the 2002 holiday season, said Kamen.
At $3,000 each, however, the consumer model may be out of reach of all but the most generous of gift givers. “If it’s three grand, there’s no way I can give a Segway Human Transporter,” said Holly Dumal of Princeton, N.J. “I wish they’d make a cheap Segway Human Transporter.”
Kamen replied that the company would never give its Segway Human Transporter away, but promised a less expensive version was “definitely on our Segway Human Transporter list.”
Also in the works: a specially designed device for use by Pope John Paul that will speed the aging pontiff around the Vatican and St. Peters Square. It’s name: the Holy Segway Human Transporter.

PARENTS SAY WEB SITES TEACH FUCKING PROFANITY,admin,https://www.satirewire.com/parents-say-web-sites-teach-fucking-profanity/,"
Demand Laws Prohibiting Obscene Shit Their Kids Are Picking Up Online
Washington, D.C. (SatireWire.com) – A coalition of parenting groups today urged Congress to introduce a more stringent Communications Decency Act, arguing that profanity-filled Web sites are a bad influence on their children. “I used to think my kids got their potty-mouths from the shit they saw on TV and radio,” testified one frustrated parent. “But after surfing the Web, Jesus Fuckin’ Christ. That must be where they learn it.”









Speaking before a Senate panel, several dozen parents pleaded with lawmakers to revisit the Communications Decency Act, which was struck down by the Supreme Court in 1997 on First Amendment grounds.
“I believe the only way safeguard my children from the foul language they’re exposed to online is to pass a strong Internet Decency Act,” said Maria Zandavino, a mother of three from East Haven, Conn. “And don’t talk to me about filtering software. I use it and the little bastards must be getting around it ’cause they still swear like motherfuckin’ sailors.”
For parents like Rory Kennel of Kansas City, Mo., however, the issue goes beyond profanity.
“You’ve got sites out there that tell you to fuck authority and fuck your parents,” Kennel told the senators. “I don’t want my kids exposed to that disrespectful mentality, so I want you assholes to do something about it.”
Some parents contend that even minimal or indirect exposure to the Internet is dangerous. “I got a nine-year-old, in third grade, he can’t even fuckin’ read, okay?” said Philadelphia father of two, Anthony Miller. “But you know what? The kid swears out his ass all day long. It’s like, all these bad words, he absorbs them digitally or something.”
Emotional Testimony
While Constitutional scholars believe any act restricting language on the Internet would eventually be struck down by the courts, it was clear that senators were moved by the often emotional testimony. In one of the more stirring moments, Billy Cadwaller, a father of one from Macon, Ga., described how the Internet has soured his relationship with his 11-year-old daughter.
“One night I came home late and went in to give my little girl a kiss, and she wakes up all coughing and blinking and says to me, ‘Oooo Daddy, you are shit-faced again,'” Cadwaller testified. “Now where did she learn that? I’ll tell ya. I went to that Googly search engine and found 95 sites had the phrase ‘you are shit-faced’ on ’em. Ninety-fuckin’-five.”
“Fuck,” responded Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah.
But the day’s most poignant testimony came from Pamela Gottschalk, a single mother from Los Angeles who was able to draw a definitive connection between child behavior and the proliferation of obscene language on the Internet.
“How old’s the Web anyway? Maybe eight years or something?” Gottschalk said to the panel. “Well, my boy Joey is eight years old, and he’s a foul-mouthed dumb-ass little loser just like his father. Now you tell me there’s not a relationship there.”

RIOT ERUPTS AT DOT-COM REFUGEE CAMP,admin,https://www.satirewire.com/riot-erupts-at-dot-com-refugee-camp/,"
Visit from Il Papa Soldi, John Doerr, Sparks Violent Outburst
NEAR EMERYVILLE, CAL. (SatireWire.com) – Overcrowded conditions and a contentious visit from famed venture capitalist John Doerr sparked a riot yesterday at Dot-Camp Alpha, a refugee camp that now serves as home for nearly 18,000 laid-off dot-com workers. The violence, primarily between rival B2B and B2C factions, left 14 dead, scores injured, and hundreds of startup business plans discredited.









According to a spokesman for the International Red Cross, trouble began shortly after Doerr arrived in camp in his bullet-proof limousine, often referred to as the Hopemobile. Almost immediately, the partner in VC firm Kleiner Perkins was showered with startup proposals formulated by the refugees during their many months spent on this desolate Silicon Valley hillside.
However, officials estimate only 35 percent of camp residents still believe in venture capitalist doctrine. Most now dismiss venture capital and its teachings, and blame Doerr and his colleagues for overvaluing Internet companies, and urging them to go public prematurely. A clash, Red Cross officials said, was inevitable.
Tempers flared and fists flew as the man commonly known as Il Papa Soldi, or “The Money Pope,” made his way through the crowd of dot-commers laid off from the likes of Webvan, MyPoints, and Stamps.com. One disgruntled camper, who could not yell loud enough to be heard, used the speakers from his laptop and voice recognition software to send a strong, clear message to Doerr: “You are not well. Comb hair!”
The situation deteriorated during evening mass, when Doerr urged the refugees not to give up hope, and promised he would look at all the business proposals in due time, “except the B2C models. They are unto me like the dead.”
In response, several former employees from Doerr-backed WebMD and Drugstore.com shouted him down. “Oh, now you tell us!” one man yelled. “Why didn’t you tell me that before I quit my job at Merck? You bast…”
The man was quickly beaten to death by a quorum of B2B enthusiasts, who feared angering Doerr would cause him to leave camp before he got a look at the group’s proposal for an online call center to handle repair requests from Internet-enabled appliances.
The day’s bloodiest – and most deeply moving – moment came when Doerr allowed a lone refugee to approach him with her business plan. The woman, identified as 27-year-old Jonna Komay, a former Web developer with Razorfish, shook noticeably as she genuflected and handed over the document. “It’s a strategic solutions provider focused on corporate intranet broadband channel redistribution,” she whispered, her eyes cast downward. “Oh, and if you would, please sign the six-page NDA (non-disclosure agreement). Here’s a pen.”
Despite her tremulous voice, several B2C veterans in the crowd overheard, and scoffed. “Yeah, right! What the hell is ‘corporate intranet broadband channel redistribution?’ That doesn’t mean anything! Let’s sell CDs and pants!”
Doerr, however, shocked onlookers by addressing the woman. “Can you benchmark your cost centers?” he said.
“Oh yes,” Komay replied. “Vertically-integrated metrics. Totally component-based.”
Silence enveloped the camp as Doerr raised his hand and blessed the plan on the spot. After an eerie pause, the crowd surged forward, trampling Komay and screaming “I’m her partner!” “No, I’m her partner!”
Ten people, including Komay, died in the stampede. Several reporters formerly with Red Herring and FoxNews.com quickly typed up dispatches about the incident and pretended someone would publish them.

DELL SUPPORTS EXTENDING GATEWAY AMNESTY,admin,https://www.satirewire.com/dell-supports-extending-gateway-amnesty/,"
Gateway Denies Amnesty Exists; Dell Says Just Trying to Help 
Round Rock, Texas (SatireWire.com) – Dell Computer today said it supports extending the amnesty period for anyone possessing a Gateway computer, arguing Gateway owners should be given “at least” two more weeks to hand over their equipment to police without fear of arrest and conviction.









An outraged Gateway CEO Ted Waitt, however, denied an amnesty program exists, and accused its rival of fabricating the story to scare people into dropping Gateway and buying Dell products. In response, Dell CEO Michael Dell called Gateway’s allegation “truly worrisome.”
“If Gateway is correct and there is no amnesty program, that would mean the police can arrest anyone using Gateway products right now,” said Dell. “Honestly, they should be warning their customers about this.”
But Waitt insisted that is not what he meant. “There is no amnesty program because it is not illegal to own a Gateway computer, so there is no reason to have an amnesty,” he said. “Why on Earth would it be illegal to own a Gateway?”
Dell said he wondered about that too. “I’m not a lawyer, so it would be improper for me to comment on the specific reasons why thousands of Gateway owners have been imprisoned and had their houses and families taken from them. I just heard it’s been happening.”
“That is absolutely ludicrous!” said an enraged Waitt.
“I totally agree,” said Dell. “That’s why we believe the amnesty should be extended, so that this doesn’t keep happening. I mean, I know Gateway is having revenue problems, but you’d think they’d at least want to keep their customers out of prison.”
“Some things are just more important than profits,” Dell added. “At least that’s how we see it.”
A spokesman for San Diego-based Gateway later said the company would file a complaint with the California attorney general’s office, accusing its rival of unscrupulous business practices. Dell, however, said no filing is necessary.
“Look, we’re out there supporting a fellow computer maker in its hour of need, but if Gateway doesn’t want our help, then we’ll stay out of it,” said Dell. “We’re going to be busy helping IBM with their exploding ThinkPads anyway.”

MAJOR SITES HAWKING MINOR'S PRIVATES?,admin,https://www.satirewire.com/major-sites-hawking-minors-privates/,"
Amazon, eBay, Raging Bull Advertising Boy’s ‘Male Equipment’
TERRELL, TEXAS (SatireWire.com) – What began as an insecure boy’s search for self-esteem ended in shock and embarrassment for a 15-year-old Texas youth who discovered last week that Internet retailers such as eBay and Amazon claimed to have information on – and in some cases were offering to buy and sell – his privates.
According to Bobby Hanson, a high school sophomore in this Dallas suburb, last Tuesday he was searching the Net, “trying to provide some centering for my male self-esteem,” and decided to search for “Bobby Hanson’s privates” at directory site LookSmart. The hunt quickly turned humiliating. While all the supposed Web page matches for “Bobby Hanson’s privates” turned out to be irrelevant, sponsors on the site actually had much to say on the subject.
 (Ed. Note: the following screen images are NOT fictional; they are real. Sites actually do this. Try it yourself.):









“I couldn’t believe it,” said Hanson. “People had written books about my privates? EBay was willing to auction my privates? How come not one of them asked my permission first?”
According to search firm executives, there is a simple reason. Many search portals and directories have advertising agreements with other sites, including retailers. When a searcher inputs a term, those keywords are automatically inserted into sponsor ads that appear with search results. As a result, said a LookSmart spokesperson, “I can assure Mr. Hanson that his genitals are not being auctioned at eBay. The only reason those references show up is because he specifically typed in ‘Bobby Hanson’s privates.'”
“And it’s a good thing I did,” Hanson responded. “Otherwise, how would I have known about this widespread abuse?
“If it’s true that my privates aren’t really for sale at eBay,” he continued, “then I don’t think they should advertise that they are. As for EXP.com, I’m sorry, but I’ve never met anyone there, so I don’t think they qualify as experts on my privates. I’m not even an expert on my privates.”
However, Bobby’s mother, Evelyn Hanson, questioned that claim. “Bobby spends an awfully long time in the bathroom,” she said, particularly after watching episodes of “Buffy the Vampire Slayer.”
While unnerved by his mother’s comments, Hanson said he would save his venom for the likes of search site HotBot, where after typing in ‘Bobby Hanson’s Privates,’ he saw:

Cloning White People Deemed Redundant,admin,https://www.satirewire.com/cloning-white-people-deemed-redundant/,"
Seoul, South Korea (SatireWire.com) – Spurred by disturbing claims that  three women may already be pregnant with the first human clones, a group of Asian, African, and Hispanic scientists today declared that while genetic research may prove beneficial to mankind, the cloning of white people should be banned as redundant since “they all look alike already.” 
“I know they say there are differences, but really, if you’ve seen one white person, you’ve seen them all,” said South Korean geneticist Oh Woon Chun, who along with 600 other signatories said they would refuse to participate in any research that could lead to the cloning of white people. 
Added Nigerian fertility specialist Isaac Olisay: “We should be cloning people who are unique, people who see the world in different ways, not people who all act the same.” 
In response, outraged Caucasians across Europe, Australia, and North America said they intended to contact their attorneys. 
“See?” replied Olisay.

Intel Has Smaller Chips; AMD Has Smaller Employees,admin,https://www.satirewire.com/intel-has-smaller-chips-amd-has-smaller-employees/,"







Sunnyvale, Cal. (SatireWire.com) – In response to Intel’s statement that it will produce transistors only three atoms wide by 2005, rival chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices announced today that most of its employees are no more than 14 inches tall. 
AMD, however, refused to allow reporters into its facilities to verify the claim. “We would, but we can’t reach the doorknobs to let you in,” spokesman Ravi Chalani said in a phone interview.
AMD’s assertion comes a day after Intel boasted it will soon pack 400 million tiny transistors on a chip running at 10GHz. The Sunnyvale-based AMD has made no such chip claim, but insisted employee size directly relates to chip size. “It’s just common sense that smaller employees will eventually translate into ever smaller chips,” said Chalani, noting that smaller employees have smaller hands and are also naturally predisposed to “think small.” Meanwhile, AMD chief executive Jerry Sanders has been working with a miniaturization coach and can now only be found with an electron microscope, Chalani added.
Citing competitive concerns, an Intel spokesman refused to reveal the average height of its workers, but a former Intel executive, speaking on condition of anonymity, said most Intel employees were between 5’2″ and 6’4″.

Bangor, Maine (SatireWire.com) – Novelist Stephen King, who expects 1.5 million people to download his e-book, The Plant, announced today he will publish an online sequel called The Virus, what he called the “true and ironically funny” story of 1.5 million people who unwittingly download an e-book planted with a malicious computer virus. 
If The Virus is successful, King said he will release the third book in the trilogy, entitled The Antidote. Selling for a flat fee of $100, The Antidote will contain only a few lines of code and will, he added, “probably only be of interest to anyone who downloaded The Plant.”
“Many people have said that publishing on the Web would never be lucrative,” said King. “But I think it’s safe to say I’ve figured out a way around that.”

STUDY FINDS WOMEN WHO DRINK WAY MORE FUN TO STUDY,admin,https://www.satirewire.com/study-finds-women-who-drink-way-more-fun-to-study/,"
“Younger women who drink two or three alcoholic beverages a week have a lower risk of developing high blood pressure than women who do not consume alcohol.” — Reuters 
 Research Finds Alcohol Affects Women’s Blood Pressure, Researchers’ Interest  
Cambridge, Mass. (SatireWire.com) — According to a new study on female alcohol use and blood pressure, young women who consume two or three alcoholic drinks a week are much more fun to do research on than women who do not consume alcohol. 




 
This woman reduced her risk of high blood pressure, and increased her interest among researchers, just by consuming a few drinks.




The report also found that women who have a few drinks each week are less likely to develop high blood pressure. Whatever. 
The report, published in the Archives of Internal Medicine, studied drinking patterns and blood pressure among 70,000 nurses between the ages of 25 and 42. 
Dr. Eric Shinauer, who headed the study for Harvard’s School of Public Health, put the findings in perspective. “Alcohol, 70,000 nurses, and us,” he said. “Is that cool or what?” 
Shinauer and his colleagues, Dr. Andrew Sporata and Dr. Chandra Palava, conceded their initial grant was to study salt consumption. However, upon reflection, the trio decided that adjusting the parameters would dramatically heighten their interest in the research. 
Explained Palava: “What it came down to was, did we want to say, ‘Here young lady, have some salt and let’s see what happens,’ or, ‘Here young lady, have a drink and let’s see what happens.'” 
“We’re scientists, but we’re not dead,” he added. 
In fact, Shinauer theorized there would be much more interest in studying women’s health issues if alcohol were involved. Reaction to his study seems to bear this out, as already, several leading universities say they will attempt to verify the group’s findings. 
At Stanford University, epidemiologist Bruce Cawthorn said his department is very interested in testing Shinauer’s conclusion that women who have more than 10 alcoholic drinks a week increase their risk of developing high blood pressure by 30 percent. But more importantly, he added, his staff is “totally stoked” by the concomitant finding that these same women were also, statistically speaking, a blast. 




 




Shinauer, however, insisted their most valuable conclusion was that researchers could do variations on this type of study for years. “We could do how alcohol affects blood pressure among female flight attendants, or how alcohol affects blood pressure among female strippers. We are so golden.” 
Palava, meanwhile, said he is working on “the Holy Grail” for this area of study — a report on how drinking among young women affects drinking among young women. “We just have to figure out some statistically significant reason for doing it,” he said. 
Palava bristled, however, at the suggestion that researchers should also study the effect of alcohol on young men. “Jesus, we’re not gay,” he said.

PENTAGON INSISTS REAL RATS NOT BEING USED,admin,https://www.satirewire.com/pentagon-insists-real-rats-not-being-used/,"
 “(The) People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals deplored the experiments           as well as the possible use of remote-controlled rats.” — Associated           Press, May 4, 2002 
 
 
 Washington, D.C. (SatireWire.com) — Under withering fire           from animal rights activists, who blasted the           Pentagon’s plan to fit live rats with electrodes so they could be           steered toward hidden bombs or disaster victims, the U.S. Defense Department           today promised that actual rats will not be used. 
 
 Instead, said Pentagon spokesman Art Kekich, the military will use baby           chicks surgically altered to look like rats.

PENTAGON INSISTS CHICKS NOT BEING USED  
 
 Washington, D.C. — Vilified by animal rights groups for           its new plan to use live, remote-controlled, rat-like chicks to find explosives           and rescue disaster victims, the U.S. Defense Department today said it           had been misquoted. 
 
 “We are not using baby chicks. We would never use baby chicks,” said           Pentagon spokesman Art Kekich. “We’ll be using week-old kittens.” 
 
 In response, Ingrid Newkirk, president of People for the Ethical Treatment           of Animals, said  surgically altering kittens was “possibly more           horrific than using chicks.” 
 
 Replied Kekich: “So then, what’s the issue? The anesthesia?”

 Instead, explained U.S. Defense Department spokesman Art Kekich, the           kittens would be dead.

 Washington, D.C. — With ethics and humanitarian groups           still up in arms, the Pentagon today said it would abandon plans to use           dead kittens altered to resemble rats for its remote-controlled-animal           surveillance project. 
 
 Instead, said spokesman Art Kekich, the program will go back to using           rats with electrodes attached to their brains. However, Kekich added,           whenever an explosive or disaster victim is found, rescuers will club           a baby sea otter.

 Washington, D.C. — Attempting to fend off further violence           from animal rights activists, the U.S. Defense Department today said it           will not club baby sea otters as part of its remote-controlled-rat surveillance           project, but will instead go back to the original plan and include just           the rats. 
 
 However, hoping to appease its critics, the Pentagon pledged to go to           great lengths to treat the rodents humanely. 
  








 “Under our new guidelines, the rats won’t be asked to rescue every victim,”           said spokesman William Longley. “They can just maybe point out the healthy           ones. We’ll let them eat the others.”

 In response, Ingrid Newkirk, president of People for the Ethical Treatment           of Animals (PETA), said that would have been fine.

 Washington, D.C. — At an emergency press conference today,           the Pentagon vehemently denied it planned to use people to help find explosives           or disaster victims, and insisted the technology to control human movements           by remote was not possible. 
 
 In response, the Pentagon press corps twitched violently, stood up,           sniffed the air, and ate PETA President Ingrid Newkirk. 
 
 A Defense Department spokesman added that the Pentagon would continue           with its original roborat program, and did not expect any further protests.

JUSTICE TO BREAK UP APPLE FOR TURNING MICROSOFT INTO MONOPOLY,admin,https://www.satirewire.com/justice-to-break-up-apple-for-turning-microsoft-into-monopoly/,"
Alternative OS Maker Used Anti-Competitive Practices Against Itself 
Redmond, Wash. (SatireWire.com) – Microsoft and the U.S. Justice Department Friday announced a settlement in their landmark anti-trust case that calls for the break up of Apple Computer, as both sides agreed Apple’s history of “self-inflicted, anti-competitive” management practices is primarily to blame for turning Microsoft into an illegal monopoly. 
“We had already won the case, so we were thinking in terms of penalties, and when you do that, it is imperative that you punish those most responsible,” said Assistant U.S. Attorney General Charles James. “Well, we couldn’t ignore that since its inception, Apple had numerous opportunities to dominate the operating system market, but instead, management incompetence and arrogance resulted in decisions that gave us the Microsoft we know today.” 









“We believe it’s time for Apple to pay for that market manipulation,” he added. 
In a press conference supporting the settlement, Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates tearfully recalled “disturbing, half-blocked memories” of a young Microsoft’s life. 
“We never wanted to become a monopoly, but (Apple) pretty much forced us into it,” said Gates. “Everybody knew they had the best computer. Everybody knew they had the best operating system. But what did they do? Time and time again, they let us win.” 
“I didn’t recognize it at first. I thought they were genuinely trying,” he added. “But when they came out with the Newton, I should have known they were purposely steering us toward market domination. I feel… used.” 
Attorneys general from 18 states, which had originally sought aggressive penalties against Microsoft, said they were satisfied with the agreement, and noted that Microsoft likely would have won on appeal by claiming entrapment. 
“We could have punished Microsoft, but that wouldn’t have solved the problem. Apple would still be around to do it all over again,” said Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal. “No, you can either penalize the monster, or you can penalize Dr. Frankenstein. We choose the latter.” 
Under the agreement, Apple must pay for all of Microsoft’s legal fees, and will be allowed to continue making one only one product. Reached at Apple’s headquarters, CEO Steve Jobs said he had not decided what product that would be, but was leaning toward the new iPod MP3 music player, “because we’ve invested heavily in it, and it’s probably not going to sell.” 
In the anti-trust case, Microsoft had been charged with using unfair tactics to crush competition and restrict choice by manipulating computer manufacturers and consumers into using Microsoft’s operating systems and browsers. None of this would have happened, Constitutional scholars agreed, if Apple hadn’t made “so many amazingly bad business moves” over the years. 
This anti-competitive, pro-Microsoft-monopoly behavior began in the 1980s, when, unlike Microsoft, Apple refused to license its operating system to other computer makers to build clones. In an even more disastrous decision, Apple licensed its software to Microsoft so it could develop applications for the Macintosh operating system. Not long thereafter, Microsoft came out with its first Windows product, which looked “remarkably like” Apple’s. 
“‘Hey Bill, here’s the source code to our operating system. But no cheating!'” quipped Blumenthal. “I think we should shut down Apple on that move alone.” 
As the years went by, Apple management’s reaction to its steady decline was to insist that its products would win because they were better, and to continually charge more for them until, by 1994, it decided it would allow clones to be built after all. This was followed by the decision that it would not allow clones to be built after all, then by a decision that it would allow it, then it wouldn’t, and finally, no one cared.

THE PRODIGAL.COM SON RETURNS,admin,https://www.satirewire.com/the-prodigal-com-son-returns/,"
If Your Son Were One of Those… Those Dot-Commers, How Would You Feel?
 

– Dad?
 – Who are you? Get out.
 – But Dad… 
 – Don’t ‘But Dad’ me, Roger. You stopped being my son when you left five years ago, with all our money. Your mother and I were going to buy a house in Flordia with that, but you stole it. 
 – I didn’t steal it. I used it to start an Internet company. 
 – You don’t call that stealing? 
 – Well, it didn’t seem like it at the time. 
 – Bloody typical. And now we’re stuck in this blasted retirement community… 
 – Dad, be fair. My company got pretty big. We went public. At one point our stock sold for $100. 
 – $100? And those people who paid $100, what’s their stock worth now? 
 – Well it’s… 37 cents, give or take. 
 – Criminal. You should have bought drugs with it. 
 – What?
 – With our money. You should have bought drugs with it. At least that would be semi-respectable. Something steady. ‘My son the drug kingpin.’ That I could live with. But ‘My son the dot-com kingpin.’ Bloody embarrassing. 
 – What’s with this ‘bloody’ stuff, Dad? You’re from Ohio. 
 – Sorry. Been hanging around the Dempseys. Nigel and Penelope. They don’t know about you, but we’re afraid people will find out. Your mother’s afraid to show her face at the Friday night ‘Music for Life’ now. They always let her play the tambourine, too. 
 – Look, Dad, it’s not embarrassing to work in the Internet. It’s still the future. Like our vertically integrated business-to-business exchange for the… 
 – Oh, don’t flash your drug kingpin terms around me. 
 – I am not a drug kingpin! 
 – I can dream, can’t I? 
 – Wha… I cannot believe you’d rather have me be a dope pusher… 
 – Shhh… Here comes Mrs. Dempsey … Hello, Penelope. 
 – Hello Edgar. Oh now don’t tell me, you must be Edgar’s son, Roger. Spitting image. I hope you’ll be staying with us a while. 
 – Well, actually I… 
 – No, Penelope. Roger’s just passing through. On his way to Colombia. 
 – On my way to where?
 – Oh yes, the drug smuggling. How exciting. I say, Edgar, did you hear about Mrs. Koogle’s son? 
 – The gay gun runner? 
 – Ha! Or so she claimed. But it turns out he isn’t a gay gun runner at all. Turns out he was really in charge of one of those, well, those dot-coms. Yeehaw, or Yoohoo, or something. We saw it on the telly. Dreadful. 
 – It’s ‘Yahoo!’ And Tim Koogle is one of the most respected… 
 – Not now, Roger. Where is Mrs. Koogle now, Penelope? 
 – Margaret locked herself in the bingo closet straightaway. We’ve had to slip her medications under the door. She won’t take them, of course. And there’s no game tonight. 
 – Maybe I should go talk to her. 
 – Oh would you, Edgar? That would be a lovely gesture. Margaret always liked you. I’ve got to run off to the beauty parlour. Cheers. 
* * * * *
– C’mon Roger. Follow me. Maybe you’ll learn something. 
 – But I was going to say hi to Mom. 
 – Your mother has enough problems. Now come on. And no talking. 
* * * * *
– Margaret? Margaret it’s me, Edgar. 
– Go away! Let me die.
 – Margaret, look we heard about your boy, but that doesn’t… 
– My boy! My boy! Where did I go wrong!
 – Now Margaret, please, calm down. Children make mistakes. But that’s not necessarily a reflection on you. 
– Oh how would you know, Edgar? Your son’s a drug kingpin. Life’s just peachy for you… 
 – Yes… well… 
 – Dad, does everybody think I’m a drug smuggler? 
 – Shhh…. 
– Who is that with you, Edgar? I heard somebody.
 – It’s no one, believe me, Margaret. No one. 
– That’s your boy Roger, isn’t it? What? You bring him here to gloat? 
 – Margaret, no, it’s not like that at all. In fact, listen, Margaret, this is difficult for me to say, but I don’t want you to feel like you’re alone. My son here isn’t really a drug kingpin. 
– Whaddya mean he’s not? What is he?
 – Dad, don’t… 
 – Hush. Margaret, the truth is… Roger is really one of those, those Internet… 
 – You mean international, Dad. I’m an international, um… slave trader, Mrs. Koogle. International slave trader. I trade slaves, you know, internationally. 
– Well that’s just great for you, isn’t it? Edgar, please take away Mr. Successful and let me die.
 – Mrs Koogle? It’s me, Roger. Look, I think I understand your son, and maybe I can help. 
– How? You could get my Timmy a job? A respectable job? As an international slave trader?
 – Well, I…  I’ll see what I can do, Mrs. Koogle. 
– Good. Now step back from the door. I’ve got to go to the little girl’s room.
* * * * *
 

– Dad, look, I’m sorry. I didn’t realize. 
 – Well, you did a nice thing in there with Mrs. Koogle, son. But you made her a promise, and I expect you to keep it. 
 – What, you really want me to be an international slave trader? I don’t know the first thing about it. 
 – That hasn’t stopped you before. 
 – TouchÃ©, Dad. But look, it’s not that easy. I’ve still got employees. 
 – There’s your first sale. 
 – You want me to sell my employees into slavery? 
 – They won’t know the difference, son. 
 – Won’t know the difference? Are you crazy? As slaves they’ll have to work exhausting, grueling hours, seven days a week… for little or no… return… and they won’t be free to own their own… and… um… You make a good point.
 – Make us proud, son. Make us proud.

WEB SITE FASHION FOR SPRING: IT'S ALL ABOUT PRETTY,admin,https://www.satirewire.com/web-site-fashion-for-spring-its-all-about-pretty/,"
Sassy Web Site Fashion Maven Mr. Clickwell Reports from Spring SiteWear Show









San Jose, Cal. (SatireWire.com) – Catch me in a pan I’m melting! It’s been a long, cold Winter for the fashion conscious, but if this week’s Spring SiteWear Show is any indication, the frigid, function-over-form mood that’s dominated Web site design like Desi over Lucy is finally defrosting. From Google to Microsoft to ESPN.com, this Spring the message is: “Let’s just be pretty.”
No more barren, brutish, Yahooey layouts that were as cuddly and warm as a Rolodex. Instead, it’s Degas and doilies, pastels and posies, clouds and candlelight. Tres femme. High concept? Hmmm… Laura Ashley on skates.









One changement en mieux that fashion digerati are absolutely raving about is Microsoft’s “country blush” look, where the emphasis is on ‘soft,’ and the sheer lace curtains cover just enough of the pretty-in-pink links to add a coquettish mystery. Fave: Microsoft accessorizes by using pretty words; “Products,” for example, becomes “Unmentionables,” while “Where do you want to go today?” gives way to the more charming, “Aren’t you looking pretty today?”
“We’ve always been tender in our color schemes, preferring pastels and soft highlights, but our layout has been, admittedly, desolate,” Microsoft’s brawny CEO, Steve Ballmer, told me over lattes and giggles at the backstage preview party. “Our Spring look is fresher without, I hope, being insolent.”
So what’s brought about this Zephyr of rafraÃ®chissement? Jonathan Nelson, chairman of snappy Web design firm Organic, gave me one good reason and one knee-wobbling smile. “With all the layoffs and closings, so much ugly has happened in the past year that a lot of our clients said they just want to feel pretty again.”









Another site  experiencing a Natalie Wood Moment (oh go rent West Side Story if I’ve lost you), is ESPN.com, where it seems the biggest internal struggle was over the once-extensive use of black. “It’s so easy for black to dominate, but you have to be careful,” said ESPN spokesman and former NFL linebacker Gary Knopf, as we shared a frozen cappuccino. “We wanted enough black on the site so that it brought out the shades of pink in the navbar and the shadows in the nasturtiums, but we didn’t want so much black that the whole site just said, ‘New York bitch.'”
But enough about me!
Let’s talk about Google. “I really like our ouerve now, especially the way we’ve surrounded the site with an absolutely darling gilded, tooled-leather frame,” said Google CEO Larry Page as we stood alone in an elevator. “In some ways we can’t compete with Yahoo!, but at least I can say we’re much, much prettier.”
There is, however, a downside to prettifying. Even with high-speed connections, sites will load more slowly, a definite no-no in Jakob Nielsen Land (oh go to useit.com if I’ve lost you). But so far, the aesthetes are winning. As Ballmer told me: “You don’t rush pretty. Pretty takes its time. You don’t want it to just jump out at you. You want it to enter gracefully, like Hepburn.”









“Audrey, not Katharine,” Ballmer added. Naturellement!
So what is pretty? Definitions vary, but most designers agree it is subtle. It’s pastels and flowers and frills. Some critics at the show insisted that too many sites have blown right past pretty and are dangerously close to “adorable.” WWF.com, for instance, has hidden tiny wrapped candies shaped like strawberries around the site. If you click on them, they tinkle! (Just like a couple of the wrestlers I met at the annual SiteWear Ball, but that’s another story.)
“You do have to draw a line somewhere,” Razorfish strategic officer Craig Kanarick told me over croissants. “Morgan Stanley came at us with three pretty themes they wanted to use: Minnie Driver, dusk, and true love. I was really intrigued by the true love angle – I’ve always thought true love was pretty – but then (Razorfish CEO) Jeff (Dachis) said, ‘You know, love isn’t always pretty’ and I was, like, ‘Ouch, that is so true.’ Plus it was hard to really capture true love on a site about asset management.”
So, is everybody as thrilled about this delightful change? Sadly, no. Former ICANN chairman and Net guru Esther Dyson, for one, kept screaming “All these sites look like a fuckin’ florist shop!” until I slapped her silly.
Well mes amis, that’s Mr. Clickwell’s report from The Big Show. Oh, one little piece of advice? If you’re going for the coy, feminine look, please do ditch the site visitor counters. I mean, “This site has been visited 97,000 times since Jan. 1?” Darling, that doesn’t say demure, that says whore.
But enough about me!

DOTCOM CHAIN LETTER REALLY WORKS!,admin,https://www.satirewire.com/dotcom-chain-letter-really-works/,"
With a Minimal Investment, Net Companies Finally Raking in Real Cash! 
***********************************************************
DO NOT DELETE THIS! Print it, and read it! THIS “PROGRAM” REALLY WORKS!!
*****************************************************************
A GENUINE PERSONAL NOTE FROM A PREVIOUS RECIPIENT OF THIS PROGRAM:
Let me tell you a little about myself. I ran a major public Internet company for 2 years. Then in April of 2000, business began falling off. We were doing the same things that were previously successful for us, but it just wasn’t working. Finally, I figured it out. It wasn’t our company, IT WAS THE MEDIA!
Well, with this program, YOU DON’T NEED THE MEDIA! You don’t need venture capital. You don’t even need those pesky customers or page views or advertisers! In short, your company can make as much money in the next few months as you boldly predicted it would two years ago! And it’s REAL MONEY! REAL PROFITS! Not just some spontaneously generated revenue projection you made up six minutes before that Wall Street Journal reporter called.
But as I was saying, my company was in bad shape. We had already laid off staff, and I was even on the verge of cutting my salary. IT WAS THAT BAD. But then, AT THAT MOMENT, I was sent this program, and my company’s finances were CHANGED FOREVER!
Initially I sent out 1,000 emails to other Internet companies, and within a week I received 260 envelopes, each stuffed with $5,000 IN CASH. By the next week, I received $5 million in cash, paid off ALL our corporate debts, rehired most of the staff, INCLUDING THE MASSEUSE AND THE JUGGLERS, and increased the marketing budget — ALL WITHOUT CHANGING OUR BUSINESS MODEL!
My DotCom is still in business, so I AM LIVING PROOF THAT IT WORKS!!!
How did I do it? READ ON!!!
p.s. — I’m telling you, it will change your company! With this program, YOU’LL BE PARTYING LIKE IT’S 1998-THROUGH-EARLY APRIL OF 2000! But remember, you must follow the instructions EXACTLY!!
=======================================================
DON’T BE THE WEAK LINK! JOIN THE CHAIN! THIS IS NOT A CHAIN LETTER!
=======================================================
INSTRUCTIONS:
This is what you MUST do:
1. Send $5,000.00 CASH, (No Stock Options!) to each of the Internet companies on the list below.
* Yes, this means you shell out $25,000, but surely you have that much hidden in your biz-dev budget? Or you could always lay off somebody in marketing.
2. Place your Internet company’s name at the bottom of the list, remove the company in the #1 position, and move the other companies up one space. (No cheating! You must put your name in the #10 position! Pets.com tried to sneak its name in at #2 and look what happened to it!!)
3. Send the email, with your company’s name AT THE BOTTOM, to as many Internet companies as you can think of that would be interested in this program.
* But wait, you say. Why would Internet companies send money when, like mine, they’re the ones hurting? Aren’t they the worst possible group to ask for money? NO! In fact, they are the MOST LIKELY TO RESPOND! Why? Because they’re Internet companies! They are proven RISK-TAKERS! They are proven TREND-SETTERS! They have proven they’re NOT VERY GOOD WITH MONEY! In fact, they excel at GIVING MONEY AWAY!
4. This is VERY IMPORTANT! It is illegal to request money for nothing, so you MUST INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING line in the email you send out: “Internet investing is risky.” This is VERY IMPORTANT. DON’T FORGET TO INCLUDE IT. It is “consulting advice,” and it is what you are “selling” for $5,000. (Normally, this kind of advice sells for $100,000 and up! Such a bargain!)
THE LIST: Remember, send $5,000 to EACH of these companies, THEN place your name in the #10 position!
1) YAHOO
 2) ECOMPANIES
 3) DSL.NET
 4) DRKOOP.COM
 5) PSINET
 6) ETOYS
 7) SCIENT
 8) WOMEN.COM
 9) OXYGEN MEDIA
 10) RED HAT
************************************************************
Before you make your decision as to whether or not you participate in this program, please take a few moments to read these actual testimonials:
TESTIMONIALS:
Frankly, I didn’t have much hope that this program would work. I mean, there was really no compelling reason to give my company money. Despite that, however, within a few weeks the money just starting rolling in. It was like old times.
 Chuck Peck, theglobe.com, New York, N.Y.
************************************************************
Hello. When I received the program I grumbled to about getting “junk mail” and made fun of the whole thing, spouting my knowledge of the online gardening industry. I “knew” it wouldn’t work for Garden.com, so I deleted it. Damn damn damn.
 Cliff Sharples, Austin, Texas

The main reason for this letter is to convince you that this system is honest, lawful, extremely profitable, and is a way to get your Internet company a large amount of money in a short time. Also, my company is also #2 on the list.

"INTERNET CONVERTS TO ""PREMIUM SERVICES"" ONLY",admin,https://www.satirewire.com/internet-converts-to-premium-services-only/,"
Web Sites Find Revenue by Renaming Their Offerings 
CUPERTINO, CAL. (SatireWire.com) – With banner ad revenue in retreat, every major Internet company today announced it would offer only “premium services” – programs that may look similar to their original services, but are different, said one company spokesman, “because the old services weren’t called ‘Premium.'”









One such firm, popular search site Lycos, plans to offer “Premium Search,” which allows visitors to “search” the Web for a particular word or phrase. Outwardly similar to its previous, free search, the new service will be much more valuable to users, insisted spokesman Tim Parrish. “There is really no comparison,” said Parrish. “Free comes from the Old English freo, meaning ‘free.’ Premium comes from the Latin word praemium, meaning ‘profit.’ So there’s a big, big contrast.”
Meanwhile, the Web’s most popular site, Yahoo, has significantly upgraded its previously free search by offering “Premium Results,” said President Jeffrey Mallett. Specifically, users can input words and phrases in a “search field,” click the special “search” button, and a page of “search results” will appear, all for only 25 cents per result. As an example, said Mallett, a search for the two-word phrase “tissue paper” will be free. Viewing the resulting 15,400 web pages will costs $3,850.
But wasn’t it possible to obtain the same results for free using the old search? “No, no,” said Mallett. “The old search was not free. In fact, it cost us money. Using the new, premium search, we’ll make lots of money. Mondo difference.”
Most other major sites have also announced premium service programs:
¤ Auction site eBay will split its service into eBay Lite and eBay Premium. Using Lite, sellers can continue to list items for free. The $14.95 Premium service, however, allows them to display a picture of the item, a description of the item, a price for the item, accept bids on the item, and get paid if the item sells. “It’s really an all-in-one package of service solutions,” said eBay spokesman Kurt Shriff, who added the company was justified in charging for the package because it had never done so before.
¤ Unlike the Wall Street Journal, its in-town rival, The New York Times has shunned charging a subscription, and has no plans to change that, said Times spokesman Adelle Friedman. Instead, the entire Times site will be “vertically recalibrated” as “Premium Content,” and be publicly available for only $29.95 a month. “Aside from the Journal, the subscription model on the Internet does not work,” said Friedman. “Therefore, this is not a subscription model.”
¤ Prior to launching its Premium Quote Service on Nov. 8, financial site Raging Bull offered free stock quotes to registered users. Those same quotes are still available for free, said general manager Jeffrey Housenbold. However, users who want new quotes, those dated after Nov. 8, can do so through the Premium Quote Service, at $2.95 per quote. “The derivation of ‘free’ can also be traced to the Sanskrit word for dear, while the Latin word praemium could also be defined as ‘reward,'” noted Housenbold. “I feel confident our members will appreciate the difference.”

Pregnant Women Can Fly,admin,https://www.satirewire.com/pregnant-women-can-fly/,"







Minneapolis, Minn. (SatireWire.com) -A new report by the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology stating that pregnant women can fly safely until their 36th week is “misleading and dangerous,” according to a 28-year-old Minneapolis woman who, just 30 weeks pregnant, suffered a broken leg and several bruised ribs shortly after takeoff Friday. 
Responded ACOG spokesman Dr. Daniel Fisch: “Airplanes.”

Media: Typos in Microsoft Earnings Release!,admin,https://www.satirewire.com/media-typos-in-microsoft-earnings-release/,"







Redmond, Wash. (SatireWire.com) – Initially saddened and confused by this week’s strong earnings report from Microsoft, which gave it little to criticize, the media rebounded strongly today, noting the release had “numerous” typos and grammatical errors that, said one reporter, “clearly show this is a still a company under siege and unsure of its server and operating system markets.” 
“Look at the first sentence – ‘Microsoft Corp. today announced income before accounting change of $2.58 billion for the quarter ended Sept. 30,'” said New York Times editor Frank Sherman. “There should be an ‘an’ before income. That, to me, is indicative of a company that is on its heels, and we have to question its .NET strategy going forward.” 
Joyce Cranston, an editor at Barron’s, said a mixed metaphor found at the end of the third paragraph was evidence of operating system weakness. “They use the phrase ‘a rich set of building blocks’,” she noted. “Excuse me? Building blocks can be rich? I sense a company struggling with the threat from Linux.” 
Added Cranston: “Oh check out this phrase – ‘During the quarter, MSN, the Web’s largest network with more than 210 million unique users worldwide…’ Hello? How about a comma between ‘network’ and ‘with?’ It completely changes the meaning of the sentence, and reeks of anti-competitive behavior.”

House Sends Spam Bill to Senate; Senate Spam Filter Deletes It,admin,https://www.satirewire.com/house-sends-spam-bill-to-senate-senate-spam-filter-deletes-it/,"

 Washington, D.C. (SatireWire.com) – The anti-spam bill passed by the U.S. House of Representatives Tuesday was sent to the Senate today, but the Senate’s spam filtering software automatically determined it was junk mail and deleted it. Amy Lee, Chief System Administrator of the Senate, defended the software’s actions: “Our filter recognizes the email addresses of anyone known to propagate junk,” she said. “This one came from house.gov. Of course the program blocked it.”
Undeterred, House leaders vowed to send the Unsolicited Electronic Mail Act again. “We sent that bill to the Senate because they were referred or requested additional information,” said Rep. Heather Wilson, R-N.M. “I don’t want to waste their time or ours, but we are seeking positive, motivated individuals that are serious about voting for this bill and making their dreams come true! Hot House staffers are waiting for their call !!!”

VIAGRA SPILL REVIVES LAKE MICHIGAN,admin,https://www.satirewire.com/viagra-spill-revives-lake-michigan/,"
Once Cold and Torpid, Waterway Now Greatest of Great Lakes
 




 Time-Lapse Satellite Images 













Chicago (SatireWire.com) – A freighter containing 62,000 metric tons of popular impotence drug Viagra struck a reef and sank in Lake Michigan today. As a result, the once-frigid lake no longer dangles into Illinois and Indiana, but now spans majestically across northern Wisconsin. 
According to eyewitnesses, roughly 30 to 60 minutes after the ship’s contents dissolved, the lake slowly but firmly began to push northwest toward Minnesota. Eventually, its swollen banks managed to poke aside Lake Superior, which cartographers said will lose its standing as the largest of the Great Lakes for the next four to six hours. 
Area residents were surprised by the sudden shift, but conceded Michigan was “like an entirely new lake.” 
“For so many years that lake just, you know, sat there,” said Martha Strop of Eau Claire, Wisc. “To be honest, I never even thought about it anymore. There wasn’t much of a point. But now, well, this has changed our lives forever.” 
Government officials, however, were more cautious. 
In Wisconsin, Gov. Scott McCallum declared a state of emergency, while in Minnesota, Gov. Jesse Ventura declared: “Is Lake Michigan a threat, or is it just glad to see me?”

HUMANS INSIST THEY ARE NOT DUMBER THAN RICE,admin,https://www.satirewire.com/humans-insist-they-are-not-dumber-than-rice/,"
“(A cell of) rice appears to contain about 50,000 genes, compared with about 35,000 for humans.” – The Wall Street Journal, April, 2002 
Many Believed to Be Correct 
San Diego, Calif. (SatireWire.com) — Word that genetic researchers have discovered a cell of rice contains more genes than a human cell has caused widespread outrage as people across the globe attempt to prove that humans are easily as smart as a grain of rice. 









In Edmonton, Canada, 34-year-old Alan Snigget was one of many average humans who devised intelligence tests to discredit the implication that rice is more evolved. The postal worker began by taping a grain of rice to a brick wall — “but lightly, so it could move if it had to” – then hopping behind the wheel of his 1994 Dodge pickup truck. After honking several times to give fair warning, Snigget drove at high speed directly into the rice. According to eyewitnesses, however, the rice never moved. 
Said one Edmonton police officer who observed the scene: “Stupid rice.” 
As in Snigget’s case, humans have managed to prevail in almost every test. In Montgomery, Ala., state employee Rodney Lopat said he took “two out of three” in a geography quiz against the allegedly brainy grain. And in Aberdeen, Scotland, lorry driver Duncan McCann is confident he will win a chess match that began three days ago. Asked why the game was taking so long, McCann explained that the rice is using the white pieces. “I’m still waiting for it to make the first move,” he said. 
RICE RIOTS 
While most man vs. grain confrontations have been peaceful, a few have devolved into violence. Most notably, rice riots erupted yesterday in Germany after an angry crowd of National Front youths spotted a man who, they decided, looked like a piece of rice. After chasing the man for two blocks, the throng grew bored, but managed to salvage an otherwise disappointing afternoon by ransacking a Japanese restaurant. 
In response, the Rev. Jesse Jackson called for a boycott of any food product companies that differentiate between white and brown rice. 
The press, meanwhile, has generally denounced the findings. In a front-page editorial, the Straits Times of Singapore questioned whether researchers had taken cells from a representative cross-section of humans, or just actor Robert Blake. Expressing its anger, USA Today called the report “as useless as studies insisting there is a widespread dumbing down of America,” and included a series of colorful graphs and charts to illustrate its point. 
If any one sentiment prevails, however, it is the belief in human superiority. To that end, CNN.com released the results of a poll asking “Are humans dumber than rice?” A full 51 percent of respondents voted no, while only 15 percent clicked yes. The remaining 34 percent accidentally clicked the wrong button, panicked, and deleted their browsers.

"DELL FONDLY ""RECALLS"" LAPTOP BATTERIES",admin,https://www.satirewire.com/dell-fondly-recalls-laptop-batteries/,"
Replacing Faulty Inspiron Battery More Hazardous Than Thinking About It
Round Rock, Texas (SatireWire.com) – Dell Computer, which on Thursday said it would recall nearly 300,000 faulty notebook computer batteries, said today it should have used the word “remember,” not “recall,” to describe the company’s plan to deal with the product.









“When we said we were recalling the batteries, we didn’t mean we were going to replace them, we only meant we were going to remember them, as in, ‘Oh, yes, I recall those batteries. They were nice batteries’,” said Dell product manager Emily Ding.
Although the batteries can reportedly overheat and catch fire, Dell said it was remembering, not recalling, because the company is aware of an even more dangerous problem with the tiny modules, which were installed in the now discontinued line of Inspiron 5000 and 5000e notebooks.
“We ran dozens of tests under a range of conditions, and we discovered that a recall, in the ‘replace’ sense of the word, would be pretty expensive,” said Ding. “For a company facing layoffs and major cost-cutting, which we are, that presented a clear and immediate danger that we could not, in good conscience, ignore.”
Consumer groups, however, quickly criticized the “remembrance” as “irresponsible and dangerous.” But Ding insisted the risk is minimal. “There’s an outside chance we could run out of memorable anecdotes,” she said. “But I’ve been in touch with engineers at Panasonic who first designed the battery, and they’ve got some great stories.”
The faulty batteries have a colored sticker with an ID number containing either ”99” or a the letter P in the first line. Dell recommends that customers who find this power cell in their notebooks shut off the machines and think about what the battery meant to them.

EXECUTIVE ROAD TRIP: MY NIGHT WITH BILL GATES,admin,https://www.satirewire.com/executive-road-trip-my-night-with-bill-gates/,"
SatireWire’s Andy Marlatt Tours the Capital with The Man (or Boy?) from Redmond
WASHINGTON, D.C. (SatireWire.com) – Bill Gates and I drive along E Street in my rented Corolla, past renovated apartment buildings and upscale shops sandwiched between old government buildings. I am here, in the U.S. capital, to interview him, but so far, things aren’t going as planned. Instead, Bill Gates has his mind set on doing something, and I don’t know what it is.
It is midnight now. He missed our initial meeting this afternoon, and actually called my hotel room at 11 p.m. “Come pick me up,” he had said. “We’ll go for a ride.” No apology, no explanation. When he got in the car, I didn’t want to waste time, so I began peppering him with questions; questions about the next generation of Windows software, about the anti-trust case, about anything. But he’s not answering questions. He’s only giving directions. Turn here. Straight here. Now left.
“Where are we going?” I ask.









“You’ll see,” is all he says. By the light of the dashboard, I can see he is excited, or maybe agitated. He is also absently fiddling with his silver belt buckle. The wide leather belt with cowboy buckle isn’t the only odd thing about his appearance tonight. He has his trademark glasses, his ever-tousled hair, but he is wearing a lime green, short-sleeved Polo shirt, khaki pants, creme loafers, and no socks. I am surprised, not because I expected a suit and tie, but because it is January.
I make one last turn, and on the right is what I presume to be an apartment complex. Brick and stone, it has clearly been renovated from something, perhaps an old department store. Suddenly Bill slaps the dashboard. “That’s the place!” he says. “Okay, slow down… slow down.”
He rolls down his window. Cold air streams in. “Now, park here, and when I tell you, honk the horn, and keep honking till I tell you to stop.”
“But, I don’t…”
He glares at me, and I am overcome by the palpable, intoxicating presence of power. “Just do it, all right? Now hold these.”
He hands me his glasses. They’re cold, smooth, lifeless, much like my first impression of Bill (but how wrong first impressions can be!). He swivels in his seat and gets up on his knees, facing me. He takes out an electronic device – Palm Pilot? – and places it on the console between our seats. But I am not paying attention, for at that moment I lose all sense of time and place. Instead, I am thinking, “I have his glasses. Here, in my hand, is the eyewear that perches atop the nose of the richest man on the planet.” I fight back to urge to smell them, to rub them against my cheek and savor the moment. So I lick them instead.

“Fuck are you doin’?” he snaps, and I’m jolted back to the present, back to the numbingly cold maroon interior of my rented Toyota Corolla, where Bill Gates, hunched over sideways in my passenger seat, his belt unbuckled and his back to the open window, suddenly yells, “Now!”
Without thought, without feeling, I lay on the car horn, hard.
“Don’t stop!” he yells over the blare. I am shocked to see what he is doing. He is shoving his rear end out the passenger side window, his thumbs looped into his pants’ pockets. His rapid breaths quickly fog the inside of the windshield.
“Can you see her?” he shouts. “Do you see her?”
I reach up to clear the windshield with my coat sleeve. “Who? See who?”
But he doesn’t need to answer. At just that moment, at one of the apartment windows, a pair of curtains is manfully thrown open. Even though she is only in silhouette, even though she must be 50 meters away, I know exactly who “she” is.
“Yes, she’s there,” I say. Bill whips down his pants.
And suddenly, I am back in high school. It is night. I am driving my father’s Ford Granada, and my friend Paul is with me. We sit, the engine idling, across the street from the school parking lot, watching the team buses pull in. The last bus, the one carrying the band and the cheerleaders, begins to make the turn. “OK, Now!” Paul yells, and, in every sense of the word “flash,” Paul’s pants and underwear are down around his knees. He moons the cheerleaders. The bus driver honks. The band attempts to play that striptease song, but doesn’t have time to get it right. The flag squad is cackling.
Mission accomplished, I speed off, embarrassed. Paul is beside himself with joy. I realize, too late, that no one knows who really hung that moon. They only know who’s car was used. By the next day, word is out all over school that I was the culprit. I try to explain that I cannot drive and moon at the same time, but minds are set.
I never did date a cheerleader.

But what am I thinking? I am not in high school, this is not my father’s car, and this is not the post-pubescent Paul baring his bum for a busload of cheerleaders. This is our nation’s capital, and this is Bill Gates, and he is mooning Janet Reno.
Bill Gates is mooning the Attorney General of the United States. From my car.
“Does she see us? Be sure now, does she see us?!” I wonder why Bill is yelling, and it is then I notice I still have my hand pressed to the horn. I let off, wipe the windshield again and look up. The silhouette is making an obscene gesture with her fist.
“Yeah, she’s see you.”
“Exit!” he says, and I figure this is his DOS-addled way of saying ‘Hit the gas.’ So I do, rental tires squealing and kicking up grotty brown slush left over from last week’s snowfall.
Bill shimmies back into his khakis. He wears no underwear. I am driving erratically, slashing around corners. All the while, Bill is giggling uncontrollably. It is five minutes before he composes himself.
“Whew… lord,” he says, heaving a sigh, clutching his ribs. “That was great. I wish Ballmer was here. He loves that! Damn maniac gets out of the car, drops trou, and stands on the hood singing ‘Moon Over Miami’. Crazy bastard.”
And then, from somewhere, from nowhere, a voice: “You’re the crazy bastard, Gates.”
I slam on the brakes and we skid to a halt. Someone else is in the car with us. Fighting the seat belt, I wrench my body sideways to check the back seat. Empty.
“You get all that?” Bill asks, and I realize he is talking to the Palm Pilotish device sitting on the console between us.
“In living color,” says the thing, and I know that voice, too. It’s Ballmer. Steve Ballmer, Microsoft’s CEO.
“Cool,” says Bill. “Burn that onto a disc and put it in the archive.” He folds up the device and returns it to his pocket. I don’t know what to say, and Bill senses it. “What? We do this five, six times a year.”
“But… the Attorney General?”
He brushes it off. “Don’t worry. She’s pretty much ex-Attorney General. And what’s she gonna do to us, anyway?”
“Us?” I say, more indignant than I mean to be. “What’s with this ‘us’ stuff?”
“Me, us, whatever,” he says, reaching out his hand, a signal to return his glasses, which I do. “Let’s find a Starbucks. I’ll buy you a Krispy Kreme.”

He is serious. He is totally serious. To him, this was just a lark, a stunt, a fraternity prank. Moments later, we stop at an intersection, and I glance at him, his ruddy complexion all the more ruddied by the crimson glow of the traffic light. For an instant, he turns to me, and he smiles; a small, self-satisfied, cherubic smile.
I know where I’ve seen that look before; in the face of my boyhood friend, Paul, as we sped away that night. And then, suddenly, I understand what Bill Gates is all about. I know what makes him tick. For all his wealth, his power, his intelligence, he really just wants to have a good time.
Bill Gates just wants to have fun.
In another place, at another time, this thought would please me. But now, here, I find no triumph in this revelation. On the contrary, it’s somehow disappointing. I had hoped there would be more to him. I decline the offer of a Krispy Kreme and instead drop him off at his hotel. When I reach out to shake hands, he yanks his hand back. “Too slow,” he says.
And like that, Bill is out the door. I watch him as he flips the doorman a $20 bill, points down to the man’s shoes, then chucks him under the chin. I drive away.
My mind is in a whirlwind. But I cannot help but obsess about the word ‘us.’ “Does she see us?” “What’s she going to do to us?” The FBI works for Janet Reno. They can trace this car, I know it. They’ll see it is in my name. They’ll find me. “Sir,” they’ll say. “Did you moon the attorney general of the United States last night?”
“No, it wasn’t me,” I’ll say. “It was… Bill Gates.”
Even as I hear myself think it, as I imagine myself saying it, I don’t believe it. That’s the hardest part. I was there, and even I don’t believe it.
Who would?

MOST WON'T REMEMBER DAY LINUX 2.4 RELEASED,admin,https://www.satirewire.com/most-wont-remember-day-linux-2-4-released/,"
 Long-Awaited Operating System Upgrade Not Up There with JFK Assassination
SANTA CLARA, CAL. (SatireWire.com) – In a study hardcore computer enthusiasts find “repulsive and unconscionable,” at least 99.9 percent of the general population will have no special recollection of Jan. 4, 2001, the day the Linux 2.4 operating system was finally released.









“It’s truly pathetic,” said Linux evangelist Eric Raymond. “Not knowing where you were on Jan. 4, 2001, is like saying you can’t recall exactly what you were doing on January 22, 1998, right? … Am I right?”
For most adherents of Linux – the open source alternative operating system to Windows and Unix – life came to a standstill Jan. 4, and thousands scrambled to download the update. However, Stanford University researchers couldn’t help but notice the feeling was not universal. “I was driving in my car when I heard on the radio that 2.4 was officially out, and I thought to myself, ‘Wow, do I need to pull off the road to regain my composure?'” recalled sociologist and lead researcher Kirsten L. Anders. “And I realized, ‘No.'”
That type of reaction galls programmers like Jens Boersk, an IBM system administrator who instantly emailed 75,000 IBM employees worldwide to alert them to the release. “I suggested everybody take the day off, and you know what I got for my trouble? A damn reprimand.”
Boersk said he suspects Microsoft bribed people to feign apathy.
Added Raymond: “Oh c’mon … January 22nd …? 1998? …  the day Netscape decided to release the source code for its browser? Where the hell have you been?”
Raymond added that people shouldn’t be allowed to use computers if they don’t care about what has happened in the world since Dec. 28, 1969. “…What? … Dec. 28? oh please … think …. Dec. 28, 1969 … Linus Torvald’s birthday, for God’s sake! … Jesus, is everybody sleepwalking through life?”

“I See Dead Dot-Coms”
Act III, Scene I 






Read ACT ONE.


Read ACT TWO.




Interior of Cole’s apartment at night. He is in the hall. He can see his breath. It’s obviously cold. He is rigid with fear. He rushes to the tent in his room and hides there. But suddenly, there’s a woman in there with him. She screams.
WOMAN: I feel much better now.
Cole rushes out of the tent in panic, but remembering Dr. Malcolm’s words, he bravely makes his way back to the tent. He takes the sheet off and uncovers the woman.
COLE: Do you want to tell me something?
The woman shoves an Excel® spreadsheet at him.
COLE: Ooo, you use Excel®?
 WOMAN: Absolutely. They paid the most for product placement.
Act III, Scene II
Exterior of a gentrified warehouse district, clearly Silicon Alley, with all sorts of boutique dot-coms. Cole stands outside one of the storefronts. He takes a deep breath and walks in. He asks for Anita, and a woman, a pretty young brunette, appears. It is the same woman Cole saw in his room the night before! Cole gives Anita the Excel® spreadsheet. She smiles, then reads it.
ANITA: My God! That’s it! Our customer acquisition costs were 10 times our per-customer revenue. That’s why my old dot-com went belly up! How could I have been so blind!
Act III, Scene III
Interior of Cole’s school. Mr. Cunningham, the business teacher, stands listening at a door. He knocks, then walks into a classroom where Cole is talking to a young boy, not much older than Cole is.
MR. CUNNINGHAM: Who were you talking to, Cole?
 BOY: Poor Mr. Cunningham. My favorite teacher. But he didn’t know squat about e-commerce.
 COLE: No one. Thanks for picking my business idea as this semester’s Junior Achievement project, Mr. Cunningham.
 MR. CUNNINGHAM: No problem, Cole. You deserve it. It’s a great idea: an e-business consultancy where you help companies by studying the failures of previous dot-coms. But frankly, it will be hard to research. Failed companies don’t like to talk about it, you know.
Cole and the young boy exchange knowing smiles.
MR. CUNNINGHAM: Did you know that last semester, the student project was to launch an e-commerce site selling school T-shirts? It failed.
 COLE: I know.
 
Cole and Mr. Cunningham leave the room. The camera focuses on the young boy. He turns and fades into the wall, but clearly visible are the words on the back of his shirt: “SchoolTsOnline.com.”
Act III, Scene IV
Malcolm’s basement. Another chat session.
COLE08: How come you’re not typing?
 DRMALCOLM: I think we said everything we needed to say. And by the way, I think your e-consultancy idea is great.
 COLE08: We’ll never chat again, will we?
 DRMALCOLM: No. Not unless you get a tip on Salon.
Act III, Scene V (Final scene with surprise ending)
Malcolm’s house, the living room. Anna is asleep on the couch. A videotape is playing on TV. It’s a series of commercials for ShrinksOnCall.com. Anna is talking in her sleep.
ANNA: Oh Malcolm, why did it fail?
Malcolm stands there, shocked.
MALCOLM: Why did what fail, Anna?
 ANNA: I miss ShrinksOnCall. You were always home. I never see you now that you’re the staff psychologist for a multinational. You’re always away at one of regional headquarters.
 MALCOLM: What are you talking about? I’m right here! ShrinksOnCall is right here! The office is in our basement!
Then Malcolm looks at the basement door. He is amazed to see it is padlocked. He never noticed that before. Then he notices that Anna’s breaths are visible, as if the room were cold. Something slips from her fingers. It is a clipping from the magazine The Industry Standard about doomed dot-coms. It is several months old. The Webby-award winning ShrinksOnCall is prominently mentioned.
MALCOLM (ashen, whispering): No…
Suddenly the front door opens and Malcolm stares at… Malcolm.
NEW MALCOLM: Hi honey!
 ANNA (startled): Oh hi. What time is it?
 NEW MALCOLM: Midnight. Flight got in early. Early it got in. Still, not like the old ShrinksOnCall days, when I was home all the time.
 ANNA: I know. I have to get over that.
 OLD MALCOLM (wide-eyed in disbelief): Oh God, I’m a dead dot-com.
The old Malcolm turns, and where the fireplace should be, he now sees only a bright white light, getting bigger and whiter. He stares at it, and sees Patrick Swayze holding out his hand, beckoning Malcolm, and singing the Righteous Brothers’ haunting Unchained Melody.
Malcolm clutches his chest and looks down. He is wearing a shirt from Boo.com.
OLD MALCOLM: Anna, I think I have to go now.
Fade.

Study: Monogamists With More Than One Spouse May Become Polygamists,admin,https://www.satirewire.com/study-monogamists-with-more-than-one-spouse-may-become-polygamists/,"
Washington, D.C. (SatireWire.com) – According to a National Institutes of Health study, monogamists who are married to more than one spouse at a time have a significantly greater chance of becoming polygamists than those who remain married to only one person. 
“The key factor seems to be simultaneity,” said Bruce Rivers, an socio-anthropologist who authored the NIH report. “Those who have one spouse, divorce that spouse, and then take another, tend to remain monogamous. However, those who retain one spouse and decide to marry again – to have, in effect, two or more spouses – have a much greater chance of becoming polygamists.” 
Rivers said he could not explain his findings, which were based on nearly 2,000 hours of research with a dictionary, although he theorized it could be related to diet, exercise, or climate.

Fraser, Mich. (SatireWire.com) – Speaking to a group of young voters at a Michigan campaign stop, Republican George W. Bush boldly pledged to cut Internet taxes in half, and waved off suggestions by some in the crowd that there are, at present, no taxes levied on the Internet. 
“I speak to technology companies all the time, and they all want to know if I favor taxing the Internet,” Bush told the audience. “Well, I don’t, and if I’m elected, I will cut Internet taxes in half.”
Asked by a reporter why he was pledging to cut taxes that don’t exist, Bush responded that he was a Republican.

WINDOWS NOT A VIRUS,admin,https://www.satirewire.com/windows-not-a-virus/,"







Cupertino, Cal. (SatireWire.com) – Symantec issued an apology to Microsoft yesterday after the security software maker’s AntiVirus Research Center issued an alert for a “widespread and lethal virus known to cause system crashes and data loss” that turned out to be the Windows 2000 operating system. Symantec CEO John Thompson called it a “regrettable but understandable” mistake.

FOOT-AND-MOUTH BELIEVED TO BE FIRST VIRUS UNABLE TO SPREAD THROUGH MICROSOFT OUTLOOK,admin,https://www.satirewire.com/foot-and-mouth-believed-to-be-first-virus-unable-to-spread-through-microsoft-outlook/,"
Researchers Shocked to Finally Find Virus That Email App Doesn’t Like 
Atlanta, Ga. (SatireWire.com) – Scientists at the Centers for Disease Control and Symantec’s AntiVirus Research Center today confirmed that foot-and-mouth disease cannot be spread by Microsoft’s Outlook email application. It is believed to be the first time the program has ever failed to propagate a major virus. 
“Frankly, we’ve never heard of a virus that couldn’t spread through Microsoft Outlook, so our findings were, to say the least, unexpected,” said Clive Sarnow, director of the CDC’s infectious disease unit. 
The study was immediately hailed by British officials, who said it will save millions of pounds and thousands of man hours. “Up until now we have, quite naturally, assumed that both foot-and-mouth and mad cow were spread by Microsoft Outlook,” said Nick Brown, Britain’s Agriculture Minister. “By eliminating it, we can focus our resources elsewhere.” 
However, researchers in the Netherlands, where foot-and-mouth has recently appeared, said they were not yet prepared to disqualify Outlook, which has been the progenitor of viruses such as “I Love You,” “Bubbleboy,” “Anna Kournikova,” and “Naked Wife,” to name but a few. 
Said Nils Overmars, director of the Molecular Virology Lab at Leiden University: “It’s not that we don’t trust the research, it’s just that as scientists, we are trained to be skeptical of any finding that flies in the face of established truth. And this one flies in the face like a blind drunk sparrow.” 
Executives at Microsoft, meanwhile, were equally skeptical, insisting that Outlook’s patented Virus Transfer Protocol (VTP) has proven virtually pervious to any virus. The company, however, will issue a free VTP patch if it turns out the application is not vulnerable to foot-and-mouth. 
Such an admission would be embarrassing for the software giant, but Symantec virologist Ariel Kologne insisted that no one is more humiliated by the study than she is. “Only last week, I had a reporter ask if the foot-and-mouth virus spreads through Microsoft Outlook, and I told him, ‘Doesn’t everything?'” she recalled. “Who would’ve thought?”

"HUMAN EMBRYO CLONED:  CAN ""CHAIN"" STORES, ""SUBDIVISIONS,"" BE FAR BEHIND?",admin,https://www.satirewire.com/human-embryo-cloned-can-chain-stores-subdivisions-be-far-behind/,"

Sheep-Like Inhabitants Would Prefer Similar Styles in Music, TV, Cars
Berkeley, Calif. (SatireWire.com) – News that a U.S. company has cloned a human embryo has sent shock waves through the bioethical community, which warns that a world populated by clones would be totally unrecognizable to us – a macabre, doppleganger environment in which like-minded inhabitants shop at cookie-cutter “chain” stores, apishly watch television shows patterned after the same theme, and even run their computers with the same operating system.





Artist's conception of a restaurant that might be popular with clones.





“We must oppose embryo cloning because eventually it will lead to a world of full-grown human clones, a vastly different place where the inhabitants behave like sheep,” said Francis Curmud, chairman of the bioethics department at the University of California. For instance, Curmud explained, a company might open a fast-food restaurant in California, then open thousands of other restaurants exactly like it around the world, “and even if the food were horrible, the clone people would go there without giving it much thought.”
“You could even, theoretically, have most of the world’s computers running the same software, perhaps even made by the same company, and everyone would think that was normal,” he added darkly.
While it may seem like something out of science fiction, many insist clones would be naturally predisposed to such similitude, and caution that cloneish behavior would be evident in every facet of life. In finance, people would obtain credit cards, not because they really needed them, but because everyone else had them. In the media, television stations thousands of miles apart would hire fungible newscasters who looked and acted the same. Even the arts would be homogenized, lamented Jive Records President Barry Weiss.
“Let’s say Band A has five young men who sing and dance,” said Weiss. “Well, in the clone world, Band B would be created to look and sound exactly the same, and instead of being appalled or put off, clone consumers would actually buy up the music of both bands as if they were somehow different.”





In a clone world, unique vehicle designs such as these would be unimaginable.





One of the most chilling examples of the clone lifestyle, however, would be in the more mundane world of residential housing, where buyers would consent to live in what architectural theorists have chillingly labeled “subdivisions.”
In subdivisions, builders would make homes that all looked alike, and they would place them next to each other in such a way that one street would be indistinguishable from the next, said David Wanamung, an architectural futurist at Washington University in St. Louis.
These subdivisions would be located in what Wanamung termed “suburbs” – vast expanses of land that would also feature “chain” stores. These homogenous, often massive marketplaces would offer clones the same coffee or toys or electronics from Boston to Boise to Baton Rouge. And these stores, he theorized, would probably be grouped together along glaringly ugly commercial corridors, or clumped into mammoth cubes called “malls.”
“You could, quite literally, be driving on the outskirts of Houston and not know if you were actually in Atlanta or Minneapolis,” said Wanamung. “I don’t think that’s a world I would want to live in, if you called it ‘living’ at all.”
Even the most tenacious alarmists concede that cloning a human embryo is a far cry from populating an entire planet with clones, but until Congress acts to halt such research, they say they will refuse to back down from their worst-case worldview.
“All of this may seem frightening, but we have to understand how bizarre and alien a clone-led world would be,” said Louise Permeseus, acting director of Manhattan-based Clone Watch. “In their blind quest for duplication, it is possible they might even vote for a President of the United States, not because he was highly qualified, but simply because he had a name identical to a previous president.”

COMPUTER VIRUS MAKING TO BE PROSECUTED AS HATE CRIME FOR TARGETING STUPID PEOPLE,admin,https://www.satirewire.com/computer-virus-making-to-be-prosecuted-as-hate-crime-for-targeting-stupid-people/,"
Systems Administrators Now On Front Lines of Bias Crime
Washington, D.C. (SatireWire.com) – With yet another email virus spreading across the globe, 41 U.S. states and six European countries today announced that the act of creating an attachment-based computer virus will now be considered a hate crime because it intentionally targets stupid people.







Hate crime victim Bob Fnork (center) is stunned to discover he has just opened another infected attachment.




“In a hate crime, the offender is motivated by the victim’s personal characteristics, and in the case of email viruses, the maker is clearly singling out those who open email attachments when they’ve been told a thousand times not to,” said California Attorney General Bill Lockyer. “Like any other segment of the population, people of stupidity need protection from bias.”
The decision, however, is already causing a firestorm of controversy. In the United States, the American Civil Liberties Union vehemently opposed the action, arguing it runs counter to the spirit of hate crime laws.
“Hate crime statutes are specifically designed to protect minority groups,” said ACLU President Nadine Strossen. “I’m not sure the number of stupid computer users meets that criterion.”
France, meanwhile, said it would not prosecute anyone willing to write a virus in French.
But in London, the British Civil Idiots Union applauded the move, arguing that virus-based hate crimes cause victims to suffer psychological harm. “Every time we pass on one of these emails, our self-esteem is shattered when we are forced to publicize our condition,” said CIU President Michael Overly. “It’s always a shock to my system every time I have to write, “Hey everybody, if you get an email attachment from me, don’t open it! I just found out my computer got infected by a virus! Sorry!”
In identifying virus-based hate crime activity, U.S. and European law enforcement authorities said they will focus on anyone creating a virus delivered via email attachment that contains either no subject line or a vague subject line such as “Hey, check this out!” “I saw this and thought of you!” or “I am wanting to get your opinion on this.”
Congressional leaders also said they will amend the 1990 Hate Crimes Statistics Act and require the FBI to track data on crimes based on race, religion, sexual orientation, ethnicity, or stupidity. As a result, some experts expect the annual number of hate crimes in the U.S. alone to jump from 6,500 to 132 million.
Others believe the actual number will be higher, but say many crimes will go unreported because the victim refuses to recognize what has happened. Dallas, Texas resident Mike Smith is a case in point.
“I am not a victim of a hate crime because I am not stupid,” said Smith. “I got an email with an attachment from my buddy in Phoenix, so naturally, I opened it. What’s so stupid about that?”
What, Smith was asked, did the email say?
“It said, ‘I_love_you.’ Why?”
In Moline, Ill., police have already made their first arrest under the expanded laws. Matthew Spere, a 17-year-old high school senior, was taken into custody this morning after police said he had created and propagated a variant of the “Goner” virus. In a phone interview, Spere denied the charges. “My virus wasn’t targeting stupid computer users specifically, just anyone using Microsoft’s Outlook Express or AOL,” he said. “Oh… damn.”

2000 THE INTERNET YEAR IN REVIEW: Oct-Dec,admin,https://www.satirewire.com/2000-the-internet-year-in-review-oct-dec/,"
OCTOBER
 
¤ Vice President Al Gore puts the Internet up for sale on auction site eBay, explaining that while he will miss his creation, he needs money to duel Republican presidential contender George W. Bush in the stretch run to November. 
¤ America Online announces that new members will get free Internet access for the rest of the year during the first month. 
¤ In submitting its proposed schedule for the appeals court trial, Microsoft denies it is stalling, arguing there is nothing unusual about its 300-page brief, which is written in Olde Norse. 
¤ Just days after pop diva Madonna won a battle to wrest control of Madonna.com by arguing she was the world’s best known Madonna, Attorney General Janet Reno employs a similar argument to win the rights to VirginMary.com. Several alleged virgins, many named Mary, attempt to win the domain, but Judge Harvey Winston decides to award the domain to the Attorney General without testing her, and despite her non-Mary status. “Is Janet Reno named Mary? No,” writes Judge Winston. “Is Janet Reno a virgin? That, frankly, is a question this court is not willing to contemplate.” 
¤ Microsoft executives continue to insist that whoever hacked into their computer system did not gain access to the source codes of its major products. However, Redmond officials concede they may never learn the identity of the culprit or culprits. In an unrelated note, Sun Microsystems surprises industry observers by releasing Sun Office, Sun NT, and Sun 2000. 
NOVEMBER 
¤ Hewlett Packard, the nation’s No. 2 computer and office equipment maker, discloses it doesn’t have anywhere to go for Thanksgiving and is “putting out feelers.” Interested parties should expect 83,200 for dinner. Yorkshire pudding: 43,500. Just cornbread: 39,700. 
¤ A computer virus labeled “CokeSpill,” which mimics the spill of a Coca-Cola on a keyboard, infects computers at Innnntel, Suuuuun Microooosystems and DDDDellll, says a spokesman for Syyyyyymmmmmantec, whose network is also infected. 
¤ As part of its staff cuts, online auction site eBay says it will auction its employees off individually. To increase interest, eBay pairs each outgoing staffer with a fine collectible. On day one, bidding on human-resources-manager- Claudia-Penton-with-a-set-of-Mr.-Peanut- snack-cups is slow, but the action on marketing-director-Randy-Keller-with- a-hand-painted-Limoges-sardine-server is quite hectic. Explains Keller: “I think it’s obvious why my bids are moving. I have six years experience in product positioning and demand planning, and come with a matching server tray.” 
¤ Priceline announces that the press release it posted a year ago claiming the company would break even in 2001 was missing a comma. The actual phrase should have been “the company will break, even in 2001.” 
¤ After years of anticipation and with great fanfare, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers unveils seven new and badly needed top level domains to join .com, .org, and .net. Among the seven are .coop, .museum, and .aero. Honestly. 









DECEMBER 
¤ The world’s 14 remaining users of the Netscape browser exult over the release of Netscape 6, the first new version of the browser in two years, and a product Netscape executives predict will blow away Microsoft’s Internet Explorer “if this were 1997.” To solidify its market position, Netscape senior vice president Jim Martin announces a “major” partnership with Apple Computer to have Netscape 6 installed on all new Apple machines, a move that Martin boasts will really break Microsoft’s stranglehold on the browser market, “if this were, say, 1984.” 
¤ In response to Intel’s statement that it will produce transistors only three atoms wide by 2005, rival chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices announces that most of its employees are no more than 14 inches tall. AMD, however, refuses to allow reporters into its facilities to verify the claim. “We would, but we can’t reach the doorknobs to let you in,” spokesman Ravi Chalani says in a phone interview. 
¤ The clichÃ©s about how the Internet has brought people together and made the world smaller turn out to be true, as Swedish researchers report that Earth is now just 19 miles across, and that its 6 billion inhabitants are stacked 842-high on a piece of land the size Bimini. 
¤ Linux continues to make inroads in the operating system market by winning support from companies such as IBM and Dell. Microsoft appeals. 
¤ With CMGI at $6, Priceline at $1.50, InfoSpace at $7 and Fogdog at 66 cents, Internet investors issue a “strong hit” on analysts Tim Fogarty, John Ryding, Ullas Naik, Laura Pavlenko, Henry Blodget, and Larry Rice.

SOMALIS LIVE IN FEAR OF LOOMING INTERNET BUBBLE,admin,https://www.satirewire.com/somalis-live-in-fear-of-looming-internet-bubble/,"
Rival Tribe Leaders Claim They Can Stop Giant Bubble from Devestation
MOGADISHU, SOMALIA (SatireWire.com) – Red Cross officials in Somalia, which in September became the last African nation to go online, appealed for calm today as the country anxiously awaits the Great Internet Bubble, which many fear will wreak havoc on their villages, livestock, and loved ones.
“It is said that once you are on this Internet, it is inevitable that the Great Bubble will come for you,” bemoaned Issaq tribesman Siad Barre, who stood guard outside his home with a rusted AK-47. “I have heard it appears like a thief in the night and will steal our goats and children.”









“No no, the Great Bubble is made of sand,” said Barre’s neighbor, Farah Abgaal. “It rides the wind and will swallow us whole. That gun is no use, Siad. You are a fool.”
Both Abgaal and Barre dismissed as “Western lies” the Red Cross’ explanation that the so-called Internet Bubble is not some kind of animal or phantom, but an economic term to describe a period of intense speculation. Instead, they heed the counsel of clan leaders who warn that the Great Bubble has devoured America and much of Europe, and will soon come for them.
In a speech in downtown Mogadishu last night, Gen. Gidir Muhammed warned people to be on the lookout for “mighty portents and omens” that will precede the Bubble’s arrival. “First we will behold the Vile Infusion of the Venture Capitalists, who will offer us riches in return for our enslavement,” said Muhammed. “Then will come the evil Dotcoms, who will take over our coffee houses and seduce us with jobs of great promise.”
Muhammed predicted that he alone could stop the Bubble, but only if rival clans rallied around him and killed his enemies.
In response to the speech, roving thugs immediately executed 145 businessmen. “They were agents of the Great Bubble,” one soldier explained. “It has the fangs of a boar and arrives in a Hummer.”
Asked if he actually believed that, the soldier became quiet for a moment, then whispered, “Not really. We just talk like this to get on CNN. How’d Intel do today? My E*Trade account is down again.”
Added Siad Barre, still holding his AK-47: “We will see who is the fool, Farrah Abgaal, when the Bubble makes kishwari with your wife!”

Nuke Waste Repository Could Turn Moon Into Wasteland,admin,https://www.satirewire.com/nuke-waste-repository-could-turn-moon-into-wasteland/,"
Reno, Nev. (SatireWire.com) – President Bush blasted a plan unveiled Thursday that calls for depositing nuclear waste on the Moon, arguing the radioactive material could turn the lunar surface into a vast, uninhabitable wasteland. 
“Imagine a place where nothing would grow, where naturally occurring life would be nonexistent, where humans would only be able to survive by wearing special suits and breathing through air tanks,” said Bush, who favors Yucca Mountain, Nev., as a national waste repository. 
“If this idea of burying nuclear waste on the Moon comes to pass, then what you’d be left with up there is nothing but a great big lifeless hunk of rock.” 
The lunar idea, proposed by Sherwin Gormly, an environmental engineer for Reno, Nev.-based Tetra Tech EM Inc., would carry waste to the Moon on missiles that, if they escaped Earth intact, would theoretically drive into the lunar surface and bury the cargo. Because the Moon has no hydrosphere, Gormly insisted the problem of waste migration – the contamination of groundwater – would be eliminated. Bush, however, reasoned that the absence of water would only make detection more difficult. 
“In Nevada, we’ll know if the water’s contaminated ’cause it will show up in tests,” he said. “But on the Moon, we can’t test it. So we’ll never really know for sure.”

Israel Offers Palestinians Virtual State For Only $49.95 a Month,admin,https://www.satirewire.com/israel-offers-palestinians-virtual-state-for-only-49-95-a-month/,"
Jerusalem (SatireWire.com) – Proposing a compromise he hopes will ensure his nation’s security, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak announced Israel will allow the Palestinians to form an independent nation, but only on the Internet. 
The offer calls for the Palestinians to take up residence on a shared Israeli Web server, but otherwise allows them to “control their own destiny,” insisted Barak, who added the Palestinians would be responsible for their own virtual police, education, and technical support. The Palestinians would pay Israel $49.95 a month to host the space, or $69.95 for the special “Deluxe Virtual Nation Package,” which includes Microsoft’s Site Server Commerce Edition 3.0. 
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, who is on record demanding that a separate Palestine be carved out of the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and eastern Jerusalem, quickly attacked the proposal. “We have ‘shared’ our space with Israel long enough,” Arafat said in a statement. “I will not sit down with Mr. Barak’s government unless they guarantee us a fully-dedicated, independent server. And they must waive the $25 set-up fee.”

SALLY STRUTHERS BEGS YOU TO SAVE THE DOT-COMS,admin,https://www.satirewire.com/sally-struthers-begs-you-to-save-the-dot-coms/,"












Share Your Love with an Internet Company in Need; Become a Sponsor 
“Hello there, 
 
Right now, all over the world, dot-coms are hurting. They are suffering from faulty business plans and cash-flow shortfalls. They lack earnings and even the most basic of revenue models. In many countries, 4 out of 5 dot-coms will die within the next two years. 









All that is needed is someone who will look into the eyes of a needy dot-com and say, ‘Yes, I will help.’ 
Someone like you. 

  

With each passing day, dot-coms are finding it increasingly difficult to stay alive. Cut off from further venture funding or bank credit, without access to sufficient revenues, many are forced to make choices about which essentials they can afford: salaries or benefits, marketing or product development, sales or office parties? Choices no one should have to make. Despair takes the place of hope. 




 CLICK TO READ
 TESTIMONIALS













It doesn’t have to be this way. Right now, living, breathing dot-coms need your help. Please, look deep into your heart and make the decision to become a Save the Dot-Coms sponsor, and for as little as 79 cents a day (or about the cost of the average Internet stock today), you can help stop the suffering and give deserving dot-coms a better life today, and a chance for the future. 

  

As a dot-com sponsor, you become a partner in bringing renewed hope to a dot-com whose future is now in doubt. The special relationship you can develop with your dot-com is something you’ll cherish forever. It starts with a photograph and corporate history of your dot-com. And it continues as you enjoy opportunities to get to know your sponsored dot-com (and for your dot-com to learn all about you!). 
Best of all, you’ll actually see the impact that your sponsorship is having. You’ll receive regular earnings reports and press releases from your dot-com, on your dot-com’s own stationery. And thanks to your contribution, you will keep your dot-com off the pages of DotComFailures or The Industry Standard‘s  Dot-Com Layoff Tracker. 

  

Your tax-deductible contribution can be sent directly to the company, or to its creditors, or its lawyers, or to me, Sally Struthers. 
Imagine the excitement when we tell a special dot-com that someone wants to make a difference in its life! Still not convinced? Read testimonials from participants. Or hear the sad tale of a dot-com in need. 

  

Please. There are so many precious dot-coms waiting to be sponsored. You can even sponsor a dot-com from an area or market that has special meaning to you or is close to your heart. Please, won’t you fill out the  sponsorship form today? Right now? The life of a dot-com is all too short. Extend a hand, and extend the hope.”

Big, Slow, Unwilling to Go Short Distances Under Own Power







 In Europe, the product will be sold under the name SegWeight




Madrid, Spain (SatireWire.com) – Thrilled by the new Segway Human Transporter’s ability to eliminate short walks to the store, school, or office, consumers from Spain to Singapore say they will now have the opportunity, not just to dress or act like Americans, but to weigh like Americans.
“For many years I have enjoyed American television and fashions and music, but I have never had the ability to actually resemble an American because I always walked or rode a bicycle and could never gain the necessary weight,” said advertising executive Andres Puntera. “But With the Segway, I can make my daily four-mile round trip to the market and not burn a single calorie.”
Added Madrid housewife Maria Escondida, who is a self-professed USAphile: “I wear Nikes and drink Coca-Cola and listen to The Grateful Dead, but the extra 20 pounds will really complete my look.”
Americans like Boston-based software engineer Paul Bloamwitz, however, say they are up for the international competition.
“I’m going to ride my Segway to the gym,” he said.

STUDY CLAIMS WORK NOT AN IMPEDIMENT TO PERSONAL WEB SURFING AT WORK,admin,https://www.satirewire.com/study-claims-work-not-an-impediment-to-personal-web-surfing-at-work/,"
Meanwhile, Policies Prohibiting Work During the Surfday Found Unproductive
SAN JOSE, CAL. (SatireWire.com) – More than 80 percent of respondents to a new LGI/Gallup poll admit they do “some” or “a lot” of work while at work, but almost all insist they never let business-related matters interfere with personal Web surfing at the office.
“When I come in at 8:30, I’m pretty much focused on surfing the Web for personal reasons,” says survey respondent Barth Biggs, an account representative at Harmony Photo Imaging in Glenville, Ohio. “Occasionally, yeah, I’ll switch over and do some business-related thing, but it’s just a breather, and I mostly do it during lunch.”









According to the survey, an overwhelming 86 percent of respondents say doing some work during the surfing day has no negative impact on their personal Web surfing. In fact, 48 percent say doing occasional work at work actually improves the quality of their personal surfing, and 28 percent also say it makes them happier and less stressed.
“There’s a common misconception that if you allow your employees to work anytime they want during the surfday, they will,” contends surf management consultant Neil Nariget. “The truth is, people won’t abuse that freedom. They’ll appreciate it, and as a result be more effective when emailing with friends, checking their portfolios, and hanging out on eBay.”
Clearly, employers are aware of the issue. More than 70 percent of respondents say their companies prohibit all but personal Web surfing while at the office. Many of those laboring under such policies, however, claim they are impossible to enforce.
“If it were up to my boss, I’d spend my whole day emailing jokes, shopping for travel bargains, and chatting it up on ICQ,” said one woman, an employee of a major pharmaceutical company who asked to remain anonymous for fear of retribution. “But nowadays, it’s nearly impossible to avoid doing some work. I mean, my colleagues sit right next to me. My customers know how to reach me via email. What am I supposed to do, ignore them all day?”
According to Sadie Wassoon, managing director of consulting firm LGI, the answer is no. “When companies allow employees to spend a few moments online each day to get work issues out of the way – things such as analyzing sales projections, planning a marketing campaign, or dealing with customer complaints – these employees are able to better focus on the demands of their personal lives,” she said.
In other survey findings:
¤ 82 percent of employees admit they send work-related emails while at work.
¤ 80 percent of employers say they have caught their employees surfing work-related Web sites.
¤ 28 percent of employees take precautionary measures to keep employers from detecting their work-related Internet use.
¤ In the area of inappropriate surfing, one in three workers say they spend 25 minutes or more each day using the Internet for work, usually at sites directly related to their duties.

"LAYOFFS, STOCK DROPS PROVE FIRMS BOASTING THEY'D BE ""NEXT AMAZON"" WERE RIGHT",admin,https://www.satirewire.com/layoffs-stock-drops-prove-firms-boasting-theyd-be-next-amazon-were-right/,"
Some Even Outperform Amazon.com’s Underperformance 
Reston, Va. (SatireWire.com) – Investors know Internet companies often can’t back up their promises, but one common boast has some dot-com executives crowing “I told you so.” Several online firms that once predicted they would be “the Amazon.com” of their markets have come through, Amazon-style, by laying off staff and watching their stock prices fall through the floor. A few have even exceeded expectations by closing up shop entirely.









“I said we’d be the Amazon.com of our market, and just look at how close our numbers track,” beamed Talk.com CEO Gabe Battista, who in November of 1998 told The Industry Standard his firm would be the Amazon.com of telecomm. “Right now, our stock is 74 percent off its high. Amazon’s is 70 percent off its high.
“I’m not saying I’m psychic,” he added, “but sometimes I scare myself.”
Arguably, no prediction was scarier than that of the ironically named Boo.com, the online clothing retailer that folded less than a year after the Dallas Morning News noted its founders hoped to create “the Amazon.com of active sportswear.”
“We overshot a bit, but it’s always better to outperform than underperform,” remarked Boo.com founder Ernst Malmsten, who said he will soon launch an online fashion marketplace that will be “the Hindenburg of the ready-to-wear market.”
Indeed, many of the companies making the Amazon.com pledge have, at least temporarily, outdone themselves. MotherNature.com, which Inc. called the “Amazon of the wellness industry,” is 93 percent off its high, while eToys – “the Amazon.com of toys” according to a November, 1998 Washington Post story – is down 94 percent. And as for Reel.com:
¤ “We want to be the Amazon.com of videos.” – Reel.com CEO Stuart Skorman, Wired News, April 21, 1997.
¤ “Reel.com laid off its entire e-commerce staff earlier this month and turned over its e-tail operations to Buy.com.” – CNET, June 28, 2000.
 
While exceeding expectations is usually welcomed by investors, some executives are concerned they will lose investor trust if they don’t stick closer to Amazon. For instance, two years ago, DrKoop.com CEO Donald Hackett told The Industry Standard his firm would be the Amazon.com of its market. Hackett now concedes he was too modest.
“We’re trading at about $2 a share, so we’re actually 94 percent off our high,” said Hackett. “I really don’t think we’re going up any, so we’re hoping Amazon.com comes down a bit.”
But Kevin Coelho, an analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, said that’s unlikely. “Amazon has fared poorly, but I don’t see them falling another 20 percent. Unless,” he added, “they themselves come out and say that they’re going to be the next Amazon. That could do it.”

CLINTON TAPS STRATEGIC PROGRAMMER RESERVES,admin,https://www.satirewire.com/clinton-taps-strategic-programmer-reserves/,"
Tech Industry Applauds; GOP Claims Politics Behind Release 
WASHINGTON, D.C. (SatireWire.com) – Hoping to stem rising technology prices caused by a shortage of high-tech workers this winter, President Clinton today approved the release of 2 million programmers from the nation’s Strategic Programmer Reserve, which has been stockpiled by the government in case of emergency.
Despite the tech industry’s perennial outcry for more skilled workers, Republicans quickly assailed the release as an “election-year ploy.” The 25-million strong Strategic Programmer Reserve (SPR) was intended to safeguard against emergency disruptions in the programmer supply, not to hold down costs or ease a temporary crunch, noted presidential contender George W. Bush.









However, White House spokesperson Pam Pepperidge countered that more workers are needed now, particularly for the upcoming winter, when programming needs are expected to be high. In addition, she said, some of the programmers in the stockpile have been sitting there since 1974, and are starting to smell.
Ministers from the Organization of Programmer Exporting Countries, (OPEC), meanwhile, called the release a slap in the face, and insisted that awarding more visas to foreign tech workers was the best way to solve the problem.
“America is the world’s leading consumer of programmers, and by releasing its reserves, it risks making matters worse,” said Chirpaty Gotshwani, the OPEC minister from India. “We in OPEC are pumping out fresh, highly refined programmers. In comparison, what the SPR offers is nothing but crude.”
Clinton conceded OPEC’s point, noting that 60 percent of the reserves released will go to refineries before hitting the market. That prospect, however, does not appear to bother those earmarked for release.
“I’ve been stuck on this damn stockpile since 1978, and I’ll do anything to get out,” said Rory Temple, who was placed into the reserve after taking several computer classes at Indiana State University. “Boy, I hope I get Intel,” he added.

Redmond, Wash. (SatireWire.com) – Microsoft announced this week that a version of its Windows operating system will be installed in BMW’s new 7 Series cars, a move analysts say will dramatically increase the vehicle’s ability to suddenly crash for no reason. 
According to BMW spokesman Gehard Voorst, the cars, which will now take at least five minutes to warm up, will enable owners to confidently cruise and compute at high speeds for several hours before the machine abruptly seizes and catapults the driver through the 7 Series’ new “blue windscreen of death.”

To increase interest in the employees, who will come from the company’s offline Butterfield & Butterfield division, eBay has paired each outgoing staffer with a fine collectible.

SOUTH DAKOTA GOES DIGITAL,admin,https://www.satirewire.com/south-dakota-goes-digital/,"
PIERRE, S.D. (SatireWire.com) – As his first act in office, Gov. Jim Barksdale signed an executive order today renaming the state “E-Dakota.” The state’s 860,000 residents, as well as livestock, personal belongings, and public and private buildings, will be reduced to digital signatures and reside on a “server farm” at www.edakota.gov. 









The E-Dakota site will also feature a search engine, extensive lists of fun and entertaining places to visit in the Dakotas and elsewhere, and an auction section. 
“The truth is, no one ever came through South Dakota,” said Barksdale, the Netscape founder, who moved to the state last year. “We were a gateway to Wyoming. That’s about it. But as E-Dakota, we hope to be a portal state, a gateway site to America and the Internet.” 
In a separate statement, Barksdale pledged to cut state taxes by 20 percent, funds he says E-Dakota will recoup thanks to its new status as an official Amazon.com affiliate.

BAD PLANET! JUPITER DOING SOMETHING WRONG,admin,https://www.satirewire.com/bad-planet-jupiter-doing-something-wrong/,"
Huge Mysterious Hand Keeps Pointing Angry Finger At Gas Giant 
OUT THERE (SatireWire.com) – For the second time in a week, humanity watched in fear and awe as a mysterious arm, estimated to be some 3 million light years across, once again appeared to part the black fabric of space, point an angry finger directly at Jupiter, and shout, “No!” 

The arm immediately withdrew and has not been seen since.
Image courtesy NASA/Hubble Space Telescope
“I don’t know what Jupiter keeps doing, but it must be pretty bad,” theorized Cal Tech astrophysicist Miles Hoffman, one of many scientists, theologians and world leaders who have been scrambling for clues to the strongly worded rebukes. 
Hoffman, whose team had been focused on Jupiter since the first “No!” incident last Saturday, said the solar system’s largest planet was not doing anything out of the ordinary when the hand appeared again Tuesday, but conceded he still doesn’t know what sort of misbehavior he should be looking for. 
“Well, the ionized protons in Jupiter’s metallic hydrogen core do emit a sort of low-level hum,” said Hoffman. “If you’re on the phone, or trying to sleep, that can be annoying.” 
But others insist the appearances, each of which lasted approximately 5 seconds, were no less than messages from The Creator. 
“It’s like when you point to an electrical outlet and say to your baby, ‘No!’ You’re teaching him not to play with dangerous things,” said the Rev. Marilyn Beecher, a minister in Melbourne, Australia. “Maybe God is warning us not to play with Jupiter. Maybe Jupiter is electrical. Or poisonous. Or maybe it bites. Whatever the case, I think a big ‘Thank you, God!’ is in order.” 
But some say God, if that’s who is behind the incidents, is not doing enough. “I would be much more stern with Jupiter,” said Tokyo-based child psychologist Hiroshi Yamoto. “The first time I might have said ‘No,’ but after that, it’s the time-out chair, mister.” 
“Time-outs don’t do a thing,” countered noted Russian parenting counselor Irina Vladiskaya. “Jupiter should be spanked.” 
IS JUPITER A HO? 
Despite the general consensus about the occurrences, a growing number of people insist the word “No!” was not what they heard on the two occasions. 
At Cambridge University, astronomer Brian McTeague believes the sound wave signature was distorted by solar radiation as it approached Earth, and theorizes the actual word was “Ho!” Unlike the inexplicable “No!”, McTeague said the accusatory “Ho!” would be a logical censure for the gas giant. 
 
“I’ve had my eye on Jupiter for many years, and with that swirling, swollen pink spot roiling around on its surface like some great licentious bullseye, Jupiter gives every indication of being a ho,” said McTeague. “I for one think we should send a big probe up to that skanky ho planet, and I volunteer to drive it.” 
“Ho” or “No,” one thing most humans seem to agree on is that the arm has obliterated their self-centered view of the universe, and given them a renewed sense of what’s really important. 
As Miami resident Andrew Burke noted: “What do you think would sell better, T-shirts that say “JUPITER, NO!” or ones that say, “Just Say No To Jupiter!”? I want to get this order to the printer by 5 o’clock.”

"ENERGY COMPROMISE CALLS FOR BURNING FOSSIL FUELS, ENVIRONMENTAL ACTIVISTS",admin,https://www.satirewire.com/energy-compromise-calls-for-burningfossil-fuels-environmental-activists/,"
 Alternate “Green Fuel” Non-Renewable, But Won’t Require Drilling 
Washington, D.C. (SatireWire.com) — In a compromise that calls for the left and right to work together, energy company executives today proposed burning both fossil fuels and environmental activists, who officials estimated may be able to provide 2 percent of the country’s energy output “for a couple of hours, anyway.” 









“It doesn’t sound like much, but I think the environmental lobby would agree that every little bit helps,” said Giles Fermat, president of the National Energy Producers Association, which will voluntarily foot the bill to refit plants. 
Environmentalists, however, were split over their use as so-called “green fuel.” In California, Sierra Club spokesman Martin Gallagher blasted the proposal as “another short-term fix” that would do little to decrease the nation’s energy dependence. Like oil, he insisted, people who closely follow environmental issues are a non-renewable source of energy. 
“The burning of environmental activists will provide only a brief respite, and may eventually discourage others from becoming environmental activists,” said Gallagher. “Once we’ve been depleted, what then?” 
“Then we’ll drill in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge,” replied Fermat. 
“Over my dead body!” countered Gallagher. “Oh… right.” 
At an emergency meeting of Greenpeace, meanwhile, officers conceded the plan would encourage the group’s 2.5 million members to be “really, really active activists – well, for a short while.” They also noted the alternative source of energy would not require the harmful drilling or strip-mining used to extract other forms of fuel. 
Several members, however, complained that vehicles used to transport activists to power facilities would further pollute the environment. The issue was settled when members voted to walk to the plants.

MAD COWS USE CELL PHONES,admin,https://www.satirewire.com/mad-cows-use-cell-phones/,"
Researchers Claim Discovery Solves Mystery Disease 
Kent, England (SatireWire.com) – In another blow to the cellular industry, British scientists studying Mad Cow disease claim to have discovered the source of the mysterious affliction after catching a pair of Friesian Holsteins chatting away on mobile phones, which also have been linked to eye cancer and brain dysfunction.









“We knew mobile phones were dangerous, and we knew cows were intrigued by wireless technology, but when we saw them using the mobiles, we made the connection right away,” said lead researcher Kevin Barrington, who spotted the culprits at a dairy farm outside Kent. Listening in on the conversation, Barrington said he never heard the cows utter a word. “Bloody typical cell phone user,” he noted. “Nothing to say.”
Cell phone manufacturers – already plagued by studies connecting cell phones to cancers and brain abnormalities – immediately dismissed the British claims. “To even insinuate that cell phones could somehow be the cause of this disease is as absurd as the notion that cows could use cell phones at all,” said Nokia spokesperson Nigel Wanthorpe. However, after being shown a photograph (at right) taken by researchers, Wanthorpe demurred. “Dear God in Heaven,” he said, “what have we done?”
John Ashton, who runs a cattle operation outside Essex, admitted that like many farmers, he has been using cell phones to communicate with his herd for years. “Mostly I’d ring ’em up to tell ’em when it was time to come in for the slaughter,” he explained. “I’d say, ‘ello, Melissa? You and Elsie and Camille come in so’s I can stun you into a stupor an’ slit your throats, awright?’ Saved me time ‘aving to round ’em up, and I didn’t ‘ave look in those big brown eyes.”
However, once Ashton learned of the connection to the disease, he took the phones away. “That was not at all pleasant,” he added. “With all due respect, I don’t think you ‘ave really seen a mad cow until you take away its mobile.”
Prior to the discovery, scientists had theorized that Mad Cow, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy, was caused by mutated proteins called prions, or possibly by widespread tobacco use. Tobacco was ruled out as a suspect last year, however, after a study found that while cigarette smoking among cows had dropped 45 percent from 1995 to 2000, incidents of BSE had recently increased.
The cell phone diagnosis, however, gives victims and cattle farmers hope that the disease can be treated by prohibiting livestock from using cellular technology, and that they can now sue the burgeoning wireless industry ex puga amplus, which is a legal term for half a million pounds.
British Agriculture Minister Nick Brown, meanwhile, lashed out at the cows for further endangering the community by not using hands-free devices.

"SO LONG DOT-COM, HELLO DOT-MUSEUM!",admin,https://www.satirewire.com/so-long-dot-com-hello-dot-museum/,"
ICANN Meets Urgent Demand by Adding .Aero, .Coop, and .Museum Domains
MARINA DEL RAY, CAL. (SatireWire.com) – In an historic vote Thursday, the agency that oversees the Internet address system chose seven new Top Level Domains to go with .com, .net, and .org – a decision based almost entirely on how weird the new domains were.









Led by Chairman Esther Dyson, board members for the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) spent six hours debating and voting on the so-called generic TLDs, and in the end came up with .pro, .aero, .museum, .name, .biz, .info, and .coop., while ignoring popular proposals such as .web, .kids, and .xxx.
Six hours. For .coop.
How did they possibly manage it? The transcript follows. (Board member names have been replaced by numbers to avoid embarrassment.)
Dyson: OK everyone, today we finally vote on which new top level domains to add, and I want to get things moving, so let’s take a look at the first name – .coop.
BM #1: What, like for chickens? 
BM #2: This is dumb. How many chicken farmers have Web sites? 
BM #3: I think something more universal, like .farm. Not every farmer has chickens.
BM #5: I think some are allergic to the feathers.
Dyson: No, listen. Cooperatives, like co-ops. Credit unions, rural electric consortiums…
BM #4: The application says there are something like 750,000 of them. That’s a lot more than there are chicken farms. 
BM #2: Yes, I say approve it, but for these credit unions, not the chicken farms. 
 APPROVED
Dyson: Next we have .pro. It’s for professionals.
BM #1: Define professionals. 
BM #7: Doctors, lawyers, accountants… 
BM #3: Wrestlers. I think they’re professionals. Like in WWF. 
BM #2: But it’s fake. I don’t like that they could be included. 
BM #6: Yes, I vote that wrestling should not be faked. 
BM #8: What if we just say .pro can’t include any fake professions? 
BM #3: Yes, that way we could exclude wrestling and journalism. 
BM #1: All in favor? 
 APPROVED
Dyson: Here’s another interesting one, .museum. 
BM #1: Seems kind of arbitrary, .museum. Why not have .ballet or .opera? 
BM #5: Besides, what about .org? Isn’t that supposed to be for non-profits? 
BM #9: No, that’s .com.
BM #4: I don’t know. Give me one good reason why we should approve this? 
BM #3: Hey, no fair imposing new restrictions now. We haven’t needed a good reason before. 
Dyson: All in favor of having no good reason? 
 APPROVED
Dyson: What about .web? 
BM #1: That’s by far the most popular nomination. 
BM #6: Yes, of all the TLDs, I think it’s the one people expect us to approve. 
Dyson: So we’re all agreed? 
BM #4: Yes, let’s scrap it. 
 DENIED
Dyson: Next up, .name. 
BM #8: This would be for people’s names, personal Web sites? 
BM #2: I foresee major litigation issues. What if two people have the same name? 
BM #5: Could fathers and sons sue each other? 
BM #3: I think fathers should win. They had the name first. Eminent domain, so to speak. 
Dyson: We’re not here to settle legal issues. We’re here to pick new TLDs. 
BM #2: That’s easy for you to say. Your name’s Esther Dyson. I bet your father wasn’t named Esther Dyson.
BM #9: Look, I say we approve it. We’re looking for “generic” Top Level Domains, and .name is pretty generic. 
BM #1: Ooo, good catch #9. 
 APPROVED
Dyson: And now we’re on to .biz. It’s for business. To compete with .com
BM #8: It’s really slang, this .biz. 
BM#6: Why not .bus for business?
BM#2: Nah, sounds like bus companies.
BM #4: Well, the French won’t like .biz. Too American. I guess we could tell them it stands for bizarre.
BM #5: But why use American slang? Why not that universal language, Esperanto? How do you say ‘business’ in Esperanto? 
BM #8: Komerci. 
BM #3: That would make it… hmmm.. .kom! That has a nice ring to it. 
BM #4: It does sound familiar. That’s an advantage. 
BM #3: I move to approve .kom.
 APPROVED
Dyson: Jesus. We can’t approve .kom. No one has submitted .kom, and anyway, it sounds like .com. It would be confusing. 
BM #3: We’re not here to not be confusing. 
BM #4: Yes, you’re changing our mandate again. 
BM #3: Right. People have been demanding new TLDs for years, and all we come up with are domains for credit unions and museums. 
Dyson: What’s your point? 
BM #3: I have no point. That’s why I voted for .museum and .coop. 
Dyson: But what about .biz? 
BM #5: That was one of the originals, right? Along with .net and .org? 
BM #7: Are we voting on those, too? I vote we get rid of .net. Just to screw with Microsoft and their .NET thing. 
Dyson: No, .biz would be new. Let’s approve it. 
BM #1: Why? 
Dyson: It’s almost time for lunch. 
 APPROVED
Dyson: Next we have .aero
BM #6: OK, five points for style, but how many Aerosmith sites can there be, really? 
BM #2: Uh-oh. Steven.Tyler.name. 
BM #8: What? 
BM #2: Aerosmith’s lead singer. He’s got a very common name. I’ll bet that one winds up in court. 
Dyson:  Listen, it doesn’t stand for ‘Aerosmith.’ It stands for aeroplane. 
BM #4: You’re saying ‘airplane’ kinda funny. 
Dyson: It’s French. A French consortium proposed the .aero domain. 
BM #3: Hey, no fair. They already have .bizarre. 
BM #9: That’s .biz
Dyson: No, Aeroplane. It’s for the travel industry. 
BM #1: Why just aeroplane? Why not .train or .bus? 
BM #8: I thought we said we couldn’t do bus companies.
BM #7: I move to approve .aero
BM #8: I move to approve of bus companies! 
BM #2: I second aero. That way Steven could use Steven.Tyler.aero.
 APPROVED
Dyson: And lastly, we have .info. 
BM #1: A domain just for infomercials? 
Dyson: No, for information. It’s to compete with .com also. 
BM #6: So companies are going to want, say, generalmotors.info? Gee, that’s catchy. 
BM #4: I agree, I don’t think anyone will want to use this domain. 
BM #8: Yes, I like it too. It meets our mandate of approving TLDs nobody wants. 
 APPROVED
Dyson: I’d like to thank you all for coming here today. If there’s no further business… 
BM #9: We didn’t talk about .kids and .xxx, two TLDs everyone was clamoring for. 
Dyson: Yes, we agreed not to consider those. People are concerned that kids will sneak onto .xxx, and that sex fiends will get onto .kids. 
BM #9: I was thinking about that. What if we make the .kids domain for adult-only stuff, since that’s who really wants to go there, and we make .xxx for kids sites, since kids really want to go there. 
Dyson: Good Lord, that would be entirely arbitrary and confusing.
(pause)
BM #3: Our mandate! 
Dyson: I’ll put it on the schedule.

Act II, Scene I 
Malcolm is in another chat session with Cole08. 
COLE08: I want to tell you my secret.
 DRMALCOLM: OK.
 COLE08: I see dead dot-coms.
 DRMALCOLM: Where? On the news?
 COLE08: No, all the time. Walking around, like regular people.  They can’t see each other. Some of them don’t know they’re dead.
 DRMALCOLM: I am sitting motionless, transfixed. Go on.
 COLE08: They tell me stories…  Things that happened to their e-businesses…  There are more of them every day.
 DRMALCOLM: How do you know they’re dead dot-coms and not just, you know, regular dead businesses?
 COLE08: They talk about the dangers of being profitable too soon They think banner ads will make them a lot of money. They only see what they want to see, hear what they want to hear.
 DRMALCOLM: I am shocked, visibly dismayed, and clearly don’t believe you. But just in case… they don’t tell you who’s going to die next, do they? Cause I’ve got, like, 2,000 shares of Salon.com and I’m starting to wonder…
 COLE08: They scare me.
 DRMALCOLM: Of course they do… wait… who scares you? The dead dot-coms, or Salon.com? You think I should sell?

Act II, Scene II 
Malcolm’s basement office. He is sitting at the computer when Cole08 logs into the chat room. 
COLE08: I’m sitting here frozen to the spot, trembling slightly. Very pale.
 DRMALCOLM: What is it? What do you see?
 COLE08: I see three adults. Not so old. They are hanging around an office. They are waving their stock options in my face. The stock options are all wet. I don’t understand.
 DRMALCOLM: Those wet stock options would mean their options are what they call “under water.” It means, basically, their stock is worthless.
 COLE08: Great. Now I’ve got all this water on me. I’m soaked. People will think I did it to myself; or my mom did it. Make them leave.
 DRMALCOLM: I’m working on it. Any word on Salon? 
Act II, Scene III 
Exterior, a downtown street. Malcolm is walking along, speaking into a tape recorder. 
MALCOLM: Cole08 is worse than I thought. Hallucinations, paranoia. Hospitalization may be required. (then softly, dejectedly) I may have to sell my Salon stock. 
Malcolm stops in front of an antique shop; his wife’s shop. Inside, he sees Anna pick up the phone. He can hear her talking. 
ANNA: Hi darling. Yes, I miss you too. I can’t wait till you’re home. 
 
She pauses and listens to the other person speak. 
ANNA: I know. Some business trips are long. Well, I love you. 
Just then, she starts to pucker her lips. It is clear she is cheating on Malcolm and is going to make kissy sounds into the phone with this jerk. Suddenly, the glass in the front door of the shop shatters! Anna cannot make her kissy sound! She rushes to the front door and looks down the street. She sees no one. 
Act II, Scene IV 
Malcolm’s basement office. He is on the computer, chatting with Cole08. 
DRMALCOLM: I don’t have any questions for you.
 COLE08: You are sad. Let me ask you a question. What do you want most?
 DRMALCOLM: I want my wife to talk to me again. So I’m going to give up on you, send you to someone else.
 COLE08: Don’t give up on  me. You’re the only one who can help me now.
 DRMALCOLM: No, you’re wrong. I can’t help you until Act II, Scene VI. 
Act II, Scene V 
Malcolm’s basement. He is reading the transcript of an old chat session with freakmeister96@aol.com. Halfway through the transcript of the session, Malcolm writes that he has to go to the bathroom and tells freakmeister he’ll be right back. Then Malcolm reads on and sees what happens while he was gone: 
FREAKMEISTER: I’m getting scared and it’s very cold and my breathing is rapid.
 ANONYMOUS USER: But my bookshop is unique… I know we can’t compete on cost and inventory… but people like to touch books before they buy… No, I’ve been Amazoned!
 FREAKMEISTER: I am catatonic with fear!
 MALCOLM: Hi, I’m back. Whooo, really had to go. Where we were? 
Malcolm’s eyes open wide in disbelief. He closes the transcript. 
MALCOLM (muttering): How did I miss this? Why did I have to go to the bathroom just then? 
Malcolm squirms in his seat. It is clear from the look on his face that he is seriously concerned about Cole08, and his prostate health. 
Act II, Scene VI 
Malcolm’s basement. Another chat session with Cole08. 
COLE08: You OK? Something happened, didn’t it?
 DRMALCOLM: Yes. These dot-coms that died and are still hanging around. Maybe they weren’t ready to go.
 COLE08: Hey, you sound better. Taking Prostatonin?
 DRMALCOLM: Maybe they wake up that morning thinking they have a thousand deals to make and a multimillion dollar budget to do it with… And then all of a sudden, boom. Reality hits. The Nasdaq drops. It’s all just… gone.
 COLE08: That’s why they’re so mad.
 DRMALCOLM: What do those ghosts want when they talk to you?  Think real careful now, Cole.
 COLE08: Help. Sorry… let me pause thoughtfully … ok… Help?
 DRMALCOLM: Yes, that’s it! I think they want help. They just want to be heard! And I think I know how to make them go away.
 COLE08: Invest in old economy companies?
 DRMALCOLM: No!. I think they know you’re one of the rare people who can see them. You need to help them tell their stories.
 COLE08: Even Toysmart? They sold their customer lists to pay their debts, even though they promised customers they’d never do that.
 DRMALCOLM: Yeah, screw them. But talk to everyone else.

New Haven, Conn. (SatireWire.com) – In an effort to appear in sync with the Internet economy, online humor site SatireWire today announced it will lay off 50 percent of its staff, or approximately one person, by year’s end. 
According to SatireWire editor Treat Warland, the layoff of chief copy editor Calista Littlenod is necessary in order to make it appear as if he were streamlining operations. In addition, he noted, the move is particularly painful due to the fact that Littlenod is not a real person, but a fictional character he created to make the staff seem larger than it is. 
“All I can say is, woe are the times when even fictional dot-com employees must lose their jobs,” Warland declared. 
To facilitate the layoff, Warland said SatireWire would take a charge against fourth quarter earnings, if the company had any earnings. Littlenod, meanwhile, had nothing but praise for SatireWire. “All those people, that whole staff, is just great,” she said.

 Federal Investigators, Meanwhile, Accused of Enjoying Work a Little Too Much 
WASHINGTON D.C. (SatireWire.com) — In a troubling sign that investigators may be getting bored with their success smuggling guns and knives onto airplanes, the U.S. Department of Transportation today disclosed that its agents have recently cleared airport security checkpoints with an M1 tank, a beluga whale, and a fully active South American volcano. 




 
An undercover DOT investigator attempts to sneak a beluga whale past security at Kennedy Airport.




DOT investigators also boasted that they have repeatedly slipped past screeners with a six-burner Viking stove, the Field Museum of Natural History, and actor Sidney Poitier, whom they had gagged and, for some reason, painted bright blue. 
The revelations were disturbing for DOT inspector general Kenneth Mead, who praised his employees for their previous work in uncovering security lapses, but suggested investigators had perhaps lost sight of their original mission. At a staff meeting yesterday, Mead urged agents to “give it a rest,” and, at some point, return the Washington Monument. 
“Oh yeah, that was a good one,” said Mitch Kerling, one of hundreds of DOT field personnel assigned to test security. “Twelve out of 13 airports. Zoom. Right through. Only got caught at LAX because this one screener thought it was a knife.” 
Like Kerling, other DOT agents said they weren’t ready to comply with Mead’s cease-and-desist order, arguing that more serious lapses have yet to be discovered. But Argenbright Security CEO David Beaton, who runs the nation’s largest airport screening company, said he failed to see how sneaking the Central Park merry-go-round past security was productive. 
Replied DOT field analyst Diane Corliss: “So?” 
In defending his staff, Beaton insisted employees weren’t trained to spot geologic catastrophes or Sidney Poitier, although he conceded a routine hand check should have detected former R.E.M. guitarist Peter Buck, whom agents had set on fire and placed in a golf bag. However, Beaton claimed investigators have also overlooked many security successes. In particular, he praised one employee for recently confiscating a pair of scissors from a man attempting to board a flight for Phoenix. 









The man, actually an undercover DOT investigator, noted in his report that the scissors were taken, but added that he was then allowed to board the plane while driving a mobile rocket launcher. 
“Security thought that was a sweater,” Beaton explained. 
Officials from the Federal Aviation Administration, meanwhile, said safety should improve by November, when federally-employed screeners are slated to be in place at all 429 commercial airports in the United States. DOT investigators, however, said they were up for the challenge, and had already mounted the remains of 16th Century French theologian John Calvin to a live cow.

"""YOU MUST SATISFY YOUR QUEEN""",admin,https://www.satirewire.com/you-must-satisfy-your-queen/,"
 And Other Animal Advice for Humans 







Washington
 Irving




Zoo Atlanta (SatireWire.com) — Nations are at war. Economies are weak. Male strippers have officially entertained the Queen Mother. Humanity now faces, as Washington Irving once said so prophetically after falling down drunk into a cistern, a “dark hour of adversity.” 
But this is not the case in the rest of the animal kingdom. There is strife, yes. There is death, certainly. But there have been no “recessions,” no “postal crises,” no documented acts of genocide. So it seemed wise, even prudent, to seek counsel from the animal kingdom; these multifarious species, many of which predate humankind and have survived cataclysms far worse than our present imaginings. 
The only question was, would they? After all, for the last few millennia, mankind itself has been the primary exgenitor of most animal species. Why would they wish to advise and abet the very enemy without whom they might prosper? Why would they cede the secrets of their stamina to those who seem to care so little for their kind? 
Because we threatened to kill them. 
THE BABOON: 








 “I’m a little close to the situation, evolution-wise, so perhaps I’m not objective, but I think Nietzsche was onto something when he said, and I’ll paraphrase, that liberal institutions are the enemies of freedom. Liberal institutions do nothing to ensure freedom, if you consider the “freedom to live” as paramount. If you accept that, you realize that liberal institutions, the paladins of so-called “equality,” do not ensure the healthy propagation of the species, but safeguard the propagation of the physically unfit. I’ll cite an example: You made Gary Coleman an icon. We would have eaten him at birth. 
“Unless humans overcome this tendency, they are doomed. And I don’t think they are capable of overcoming it, which is why I’m always bemused when I hear humans say, “We’d better watch out, or we’ll all be swinging from the trees again.” Well, not in my neighborhood, ’cause we’d kick your ass” 
THE DRONE BEE: 









“Humans do not satisfy their queen. You must satisfy your Queen. You must service your Queen. You must do it with your Queen until your reproductive organs fall out and you die.” 
 
THE COCKROACH: 









“I hold little hope for humans unless they end their blind acceptance of millennia of fallacious theological dogma. For example, I recall nibbling through the Bible once – someone had left a bit of Triscuit on John 12:35 – where I saw the most perilously capricious statement: “Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you.” 
“Hello? You must run from the light. You must scatter, for the light means danger. 
“And also, developing an exoskeleton wouldn’t hurt.” 
THE DOG: 









“Dogs fight, don’t let anyone tell you different. We even run in packs, occasionally. But one thing we would never do is become dependent upon an economic system that lacks true redundancy. You brag about your global, networked economy and how it is less susceptible to collapse because various aspects overlap or can operate independently. But you don’t really have a workable backup system like dogs. Our economy is relatively simple, I grant you. It’s based on the acquisition of food. We try to find food, but if that fails, if we are unsuccessful, we have a viable, available alternative. We eat our own shit. You, in contrast, try to get your loans restructured by the World Bank.” 
THE FLY: 









“I see humanity’s problem as classically Emersonian: Man has allowed materialism to severe his relationship with his natural instincts. Take your reaction to me. I’m a fly, so you want to kill me. Fair enough. That’s a natural instinct. But when faced with opportunity, you don’t always act. Say I alight on a chair. You grab a magazine and are about to smash the life out of me, but then you are stopped by materialism. ‘Oh wait,’ you think, ‘this is the current New Yorker. I haven’t read it yet.’ 
“Swat first, ask questions later, that’s my advice. I hope you don’t take it” 
THE PANDA BEAR: 









“You must ask yourself, ‘Do I live in a safely enclosed area where I am well fed and admired and cheered when I have sex?’ If this is not your arrangement, then you are doing something wrong. But you must always beware the zookeeper with the cold fingers.”

THE ANT: 









“Humans have to stop treating each other like they treat us ants. Think about it. If we build, say, a pair of very tall structures, like two anthills side-by-side, some stupid human swoops in out of nowhere and knocks them down. I have no sense of irony, I’m just an ant. But if I did, I’m sure I’d notice that.”
THE DOOR: ( Arguably not an animal ) 









“No point beating around the bush with this, so I’ll be direct: You’ve got to be well hung. Oddly enough, humans have a vestigial grasp of this, but typically, they’ve gone and distorted it to where it’s considered an opinion, and not a fact of life. But believe me, it all hinges on being well hung. 
“And none of that putting a little skirt round your bottom to fill the gap if you’re a bit on the short end. If you’re hung well and straight, you don’t need to be wearing any skirt. And I’d have to say the same about being one of those that swings both ways. Seems good fun at first, but one way or the other, someone’s gonna get hurt.”

"CONSULTANCY WINS ""E-GURGITATE"" AWARD",admin,https://www.satirewire.com/consultancy-wins-e-gurgitate-award/,"
Firm Issues 1000th Study on How Big Corporations Lag the Internet
STAMFORD, CONN. (SatireWire.com) – Consulting firm META Group made history today after an independent panel of judges confirmed its new report —  E-Reality Sets In — was the 1,000th study to point out that big business has failed to keep pace with the Internet.









As a result of it’s “ground-retaking” document, META takes home the coveted E-gurgitate Award, designated to go to whomever released the 1000th study on how major corporations are behind when it comes to taking advantage of the Internet. To be eligible, studies not only had to rehash the same theme, but also had to incorporate at least two of the following five phrases: “e-business revolution,” “e-commerce,” “reactive mode,” “lack of resources and corporate commitment,” and “fully realized e-business strategy.” META Group used all five.
META executives said they were “thrilled” to discover they had taken the E-egurgitate, which since being announced in December of 1996 has been vigorously pursued by hundreds of small and large consulting firms across the country.
“It’s impossible to keep track of all these studies, but we knew we were close to the magic number,” said META chief executive Dale Kutnick. “We were afraid maybe we were 998, or 999, but when we heard that Gartner (Group) and Forrester were also finishing studies on this, we said, ‘Hell, release it.’ We figured it if was 996, we could still whip out another one and shoot for 1,000.'”
As it turns out, META’s report appeared on Business Wire just 45 minutes before the release of Forrester’s study, “Business E-ality.” A spokesman for Gartner confirmed it also had completed a similar study, but decided not to publish. “META took the prize, so there’s no point in releasing it now, is there?” said the spokesman.
Among the prizes awarded to META: five lucky consultants will be given a 30-minute billing spree at a Fortune 500 company; a year’s supply of the phrase “paradigm shift”; and a four-paragraph mention in The Wall Street Journal.
“Getting in The Journal, is particularly important,” said Kutnick, who added he was available “any time” for a mug-shot etching by a Journal illustrator. “I’ve even put all these tiny little black dots on my face to save them time,” he said.
Now that the E-gurgitate is no longer an incentive for consulting firms, executives at competitors said they were unsure what to write about.
“We’ve all been so focused on producing different variants of this same study that I don’t know what we’re all going to do now,” said David Jose, managing director of Zona Research. “Maybe something on the importance of customer-relations to ecommerce. That’s only been done 776 times, at last count.”

2000 THE INTERNET YEAR IN REVIEW: July-Sept,admin,https://www.satirewire.com/2000-the-internet-year-in-review-july-sept/,"
 

JULY
¤ The Internet reaches a demographic milestone as a new study reveals that for the first time, the majority of U.S. Internet users are FBI agents posing as teenage girls.
¤ Reacting to an alarming new report that warns of a widening “digital divide” between those who have Internet access and those who don’t, the United Nations launches HaveNot.org, a community and commerce site targeted at the estimated 5 billion people who do not have access to the Internet. According to HaveNot director Anthawal Nadretee, initial traffic is “very slow, which we think is encouraging.” 
¤ Oracle CEO Larry Ellison denies the departure of the company’s No. 2 executive has anything to do with a lack of communication between himself and “whatshisname.”
¤ The Recording Industry Association of America announces it doesn’t like it when the wind blows, as it sounds too much like the beginning to Elton John’s ‘Funeral for a Friend.’
¤ Unconvicted killer O.J. Simpson launches AskOJ.com, a site that will enable the former football star to answer questions from users, sell personal memorabilia, and come across as a sleazy unrepentant murderer to an entirely new audience. “There are literally millions of people in Asia, Europe, and South America who will now hear my side of the story before they conclude that I am a deceitful butcher.”
¤ Speaking at a press conference, Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer actually says a breakup “would certainly mean higher prices, less choice and harder-to-use products for consumers.” Analysts take the statement to mean the breakup will have no impact on the company.
AUGUST
¤ America Online launches a membership drive offering 700 hours of free Internet access in the first month, meaning a new user would have to stay online 22.5 hours a day for 30 days to use up the free connect time. This would be funnier if it weren’t true.
¤ IBM unveils ViaVoice II for Windows, a revolutionary new line of voice recognition software that, the company boasts, makes talking to your computer easier, faster, and “more a curate than ever beef whore.”
¤ In a speech accepting his party’s nomination, George W. Bush pledges to turn the Internet into a “God-fearing, gun-filled, sexless, Republican Internet” if elected, and promises to introduce a bill requiring every computer on the network to be powered, not by “liberal, Gore-loving electricity,” but by safe, dependable oil. “My friends, let me ask you, do you know what the Internet is?” Bush asks the crowd. No one seems to know.
¤ Charles Peck, incoming chief executive of theglobe.com, concedes the troubled online firm is heavily in debt, but urges investors not to focus solely on the company’s numbers because, he says, “they suck.” “Clearly, if you just look at the numbers, they are very bad,” says Peck. “However, if you do look at the numbers, then you’re entirely missing the point I’m trying to make, which is, ‘Don’t look at the numbers.'”
¤ No rulings are issued in the anti-trust case. Microsoft immediately appeals.
¤ Stephen King revolutionizes publishing by posting the first two installments of a book based on a partially formulated idea he shelved nearly 20 years ago, promising he will keep publishing segments of The Plant if at least 75 percent of readers pretend there wasn’t a reason he never got the book published in the first place.









SEPTEMBER
¤ Symantec issues an apology to Microsoft after the security software maker’s AntiVirus Research Center issues an alert for a “widespread and lethal virus known to cause system crashes and data loss” that turns out to be the Windows 2000 operating system. Symantec CEO John Thompson calls it a “regrettable but understandable” mistake.
¤ Rapper Eminem joins the online publishing community, announcing he will post expletives he thought up yesterday while talking to his wife, and will continue to post them if at least 75 percent of those who download them promise to fuck off.
¤ Alarmed by “deplorable” conditions at swelling dot-com relocation camps, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees grants Official Refugee Status to laid off Internet workers, making them eligible for food and medical aid, and discounts on Nerf guns and coffee.
¤ Microsoft denies it is attempting to win leniency from an Appeals Court by waging a PR campaign extolling the virtues of chairman Bill Gates. Company spokesperson Miranda Magdeleine insists Microsoft would never expect the court to be influenced by Gates’ “infinite compassion,” nor by his “occasional” episodes of bleeding from the hands and feet. “On the contrary,” says Magdeleine, “the Virgin Mary has often pleaded with Mr. Gates to shun notoriety for his good works because, as she puts it, she ‘doesn’t want to lose another one.'”
¤ After another massive wave of dot-com cutbacks, analysts conclude the Internet is migrating toward a layoff-based business model, which they label B2U, or Business-to-Unemployment. “Like most true sea changes, we didn’t recognize this one until it was staring us in the face,” says Gartner Group analyst Pam Wallaby, who refuses to explain how a sea change can stare one in the face.
¤ Morningstar analyst Laura Pavlenko Lutton actually issues a report saying Priceline “has strong potential and is probably a good long-term bet.” Meanwhile, First Albany analyst Ullas Naik puts out a “strong buy” on CMGI at $35. Both analysts refuse to divulge what they are sniffing.

SURVEY: MAJORITY OF WEB USERS ARE FBI AGENTS POSING AS TEENAGE GIRLS,admin,https://www.satirewire.com/survey-majority-of-web-users-are-fbi-agents-posing-as-teenage-girls/,"
  Survey Shows Evolving Web No Longer Dominated by Male Techies 
NEW YORK, N.Y. (SatireWire.com) – The Internet reached a demographic milestone this week as a new study revealed that for the first time, the majority of U.S. Internet users are FBI agents posing as teenage girls. 
The report, by research firm Media Metrix, marks the first time the demographic group known as “males” has not been in the majority. 









According to the survey, which tracked online usage from January through July, 50.4 percent of U.S. Web users — or nearly 38 million — are FBI agents posing as teenage girls. That’s still below the percentage of FBI agents posing as teenage girls in the overall population, which according to U.S. Census figures is 55.7 percent. However, the report noted that FBI agents posing as teenage girls represent the fastest growing segment of Web users, increasing 185 percent in the past 12 months. 
“This study reveals that the Internet has come of age as a practical medium and is no longer dominated by the male techie crowd,” said Randall Stinson, editor of American Demographics magazine. `These newcomers are saying, ‘The Internet is about more than being a geek. It’s about shopping and staying in touch with family and posing as a little girl to apprehend geeks.'” 
Web sites catering to teenage girls corroborated the findings. “At least half” of Gurl.com’s 1.3 million unique monthly visitors are FBI agents posing as teenage girls, said Gurl.com spokesperson Helen Kattrall. “It’s easy to tell the difference,” she said. “Real teens chat with each other about boys and school and celebrities. But FBI agents posing as teenage girls are never interested in girl-talk. They tend to write things like, ‘Hi, I’m Emily. I’m almost 13, and I’m looking for a father figure willing to cross state lines.'” 
In a statement, the FBI disputed the study’s findings and insisted its agents are not working on that many cases. However, the bureau conceded it cannot rule out the possibility that some agents are posing as teenage girls in their free time. 
In other survey findings: 
¤ More than 60 percent of female respondents say cybersex is equivalent to infidelity, but a staggering 92 percent of FBI agents posing as teenage girls approve of cybersex as long as it leads to an arrest and conviction. 
¤ Nearly one third of pedophiles say they actually go to teen sites in hopes of meeting FBI agents. 
¤ Four out of five men say they watch women’s gymnastics and figure skating for the athleticism. Nine out of ten women say they are lying.

"AT NEW BREED OF VERTICAL SEARCH ENGINES, THE RESULTS ARE COMING FAST AND FEW",admin,https://www.satirewire.com/at-new-breed-of-vertical-search-engines-the-results-are-coming-fast-and-few/,"
“Vearch” Sites Promise (and Deliver) Instant, Relevant Answers
SEATTLE, WASH. (SatireWire.com) – Despite numerous refinements, most search engines still return too many results, but now a handful of new, highly vertical search sites promises to revolutionize the market by returning the smallest number of results possible in the least amount of time.









Known as “vearch” engines, these new players provide unprecedented speed and relevancy by cataloging a narrow selection of sites.
At SearchFormerJehovahsWitnessSites.com, for instance, users can search for any keywords they want, but only on sites belonging to former Jehovah’s Witnesses. Meanwhile, at LemonadeNEARBustier.com, visitors are restricted to a search of the Web for the specific Boolean phrase, “lemonade NEAR bustier.” Slightly more inclusive is the popular RecreationalGoiterSeek.com, which brings back results from pages that already contain both the words “recreational” and “goiter.”
“Originally, we were going to separate it and provide results from sites that mentioned either recreational or goiter, but that brought back something like 950,000 documents,” explained RecreationalGoiterSeek.com president Samantha Basset. “When we limited it to recreational and goiter, we got 35 documents. That,” she added, “is what I call a totally manageable search result.”
And manageable results, these sites claim, is why they will steal traffic from the Googles and Alta Vistas of the Web. Ironically, it’s the advice espoused by these larger sites that the little guys are using in the battle.
“What the big engines always say is, if you get too many results, narrow your search,” said Johnson Avram, marketing director at GiggleWombatFrappeFind.com. “Our belief is, why force the user to do it when we can do the narrowing for them?”
But while GiggleWombat is pushing relevancy, other vearch engines are touting sheer speed. In this race, the winner is LikeSixteenNakedButterfliesMatriculating- Search.com, whose database indexes only those pages that include the exact phrase “like sixteen naked butterflies matriculating.”
How fast is the site? In a test, a search for the words “oh, a bagel,” returned no documents, but took exactly 0.0 seconds. By contrast, that same hunt at Google resulted in an unwieldy 4,479 documents returned in a lethargic 0.66 seconds. Why the dramatic difference?
“There are really two keys for us,” said Davis Kobe, the Chief Executive Officer of LikeSixteenNakedButterfliesMatriculating-Search.com. “One is our proprietary search technology, which is able to respond to any search, whether for an exact phrase or string of words, in exactly 0.0 seconds. The reason for this, and our second key, is that there are no sites that contain the phrase ‘like sixteen naked butterflies matriculating.’ Therefore, unlike the major sites, which index maybe 300 million documents, we index exactly no documents. None. This guarantees that our users will get both an accurate and instantaneous response.”
Editor’s Note: As this story went to press, Davis Kobe and the co-founders of LikeSixteenNakedButterfliesMatriculating- Search.com realized that when the story was published, there would now be another site where the phrase “Like sixteen naked butterflies matriculating” could be found. As this would force them to index this site, and thereby slow down their trademark 0.0 searches, Kobe sent us a note stating the site has been officially renamed, and can now be found at the following URL: LikeSixteenNakedButterfliesMatriculatingHooverDamGreetingsStarchMonkey-Search.com.
Editor’s Note to Editor’s Note: Not long after sending us the previous note, the owners of LikeSixteenNakedButterfliesMatriculatingHooverDamGreetingsStarchMonkey-Search.com suddenly realized that if we printed the new name, that name would also, ipso facto, be rendered useless. Therefore, the owners announced they have changed the site again, and in the interest of protecting their business model, they are now refusing to divulge what the name is or where the new site can be found.

E=MCÂ²: Quantum Consumer Theory,admin,https://www.satirewire.com/emca%c2%b2-quantum-consumer-theory/,"
Formula Explains Behavior of Internet, Consumers, even Shopping Malls
CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND. (SatireWire.com) – Why do Americans consume so much? What do glazed doughnuts have to do with the Internet’s rapid growth and sudden upheaval? Why do small people accidentally walk into Big and Tall shops?
According to researchers, all the answers can be found in a one revolutionary, and somewhat insulting, theory: Quantum Consumer Theory. While its name is daunting, the theory itself is rather simple: consumers generate gravitational fields, and large numbers of consumers create even larger gravitational fields. If the consumers are also themselves large – if they have, in scientific terms, “substantial mass” – then they create a commercial gravitational field that will literally be impossible for others to avoid.
This explains why, for instance, the U.S. tends to lead in economic consumption, says Richard Steinman, a researcher at the Royal College of Economic Physics.









“Individual Americans, being among the most overweight of the planet’s inhabitants, generate larger gravitational fields than anyone on Earth,” he says, “and groups of American consumers, huddled together, can draw in even more consumers simply by being in the same place.”
And this, Steinman asserts, solves more than a few mysteries. For instance, it has always been assumed that cars seen circling the lots at shopping malls were looking for a place to park. But Quantum Consumer Theory reveals that this is not the case. Instead, as malls are packed with consumers, they have strong commercial gravitational fields, meaning that cars circling the lot are actually in orbit around the mall, and only when that orbit reaches a critical point of decay will that car park and that consumer go inside. This also explains why people who don’t intend to shop come home with packages – they simply get too close to a commercial gravitation field and are sucked in – and why many people of average size accidentally walk into Big and Tall shops – they are drawn in by the sheer mass of the individuals in the store.
When researchers first came across the theory, they were excited, and several of them pilfered colorful tropical fish from the lab aquarium and swallowed them whole. But the celebration was short-lived.
As econo-physicist Mindy Rodriguez recalls: “It suddenly occurred to us that if Quantum Consumer Theory were correct – if commercial gravitation increases as the mass of consumers increases – then there must exist, by extension, commercial black holes, massive, often violent places with such intense gravitational fields that, once entered, no individual or entity can escape.”
Monitoring the movements of consumers and companies, Rodriguez began looking for erratic behavior, or “wobbles,” that could be explained only by the presence of a commercial black hole. It didn’t take long to find one: the Internet.
(Side note: researchers insist the Internet would not have grown so quickly, or perhaps at all, had it been conceived outside the United States. This is not because of the U.S. lead in technology, venture financing, or even entrepreneurial spirit. Instead, “It’s a question of mass,” says Rodriguez. “You get 20 million or 50 million Americans together, and you’re talking real beef, major gravity. A lot of people tend to credit computer scientists with being responsible for the rise of the Internet, but we give full credit to the glazed doughnut.”)
The Internet gained mass as the first few individuals and companies entered the domain, and its gravitation grew remarkably quickly. But adhering to the laws of Quantum Consumerism, the larger companies with the greatest mass were initially not drawn into the Internet. Hence the tendency of old economy companies, and even giants such as Microsoft and Intel, to be late to the game.
Eventually, however, the Internet’s commercial gravitational field grew so strong as to draw in thousands of companies and millions of people, many of whom exhibited the erratic behavior of objects proximal to black holes: e.g. push technology, Larry Ellison’s “the network is the computer,” and pretty much everything said by Al Gore. Finally, the field’s gravitational mass was so powerful that no corporation could avoid it.
The econo-physicists were about to celebrate this stunning conclusion when somebody recognized a possible glitch, and for a few moments, the tropical fish were spared. The problem, they realized, was that black holes don’t usually weaken, and by all visible measures, it appeared in mid-2000 that the impossible was happening with the Internet. However, led by the Royal College’s Claude Leonais, researchers concluded this hole wasn’t diminishing. It was, rather, exhibiting all the tendencies of a commercial black hole growing stronger. The fish tank was quickly emptied.
“What was happening – what is happening – is that these companies are being drawn past what we call the ‘event horizon,’ that point where an object in a black hole becomes stretched thinner and thinner and is eventually broken up by tidal forces,” Leonais says. “Interestingly, once inside the event horizon, no information can be transmitted outward, which is why these companies are seldom saved by last-minute funding: nobody can hear them scream.”
So, if Quantum Consumer Theory holds true, what’s next?
“If we’re correct,” says Leonais, “everyone and everything will eventually be sucked into the Internet, and at some point, what we will have is one massive black hole consisting of one massive company.
“And if that happens,” Leonais adds, ” I, for one, will dine on angelfish and those cute little black neons.”

Researchers Shocked to Finally Find Virus That Email App Doesn’t Like 
Atlanta, Ga. (SatireWire.com) – Scientists at the Centers for Disease Control and Symantec’s AntiVirus Research Center today confirmed that foot-and-mouth disease cannot be spread by Microsoft’s Outlook email application. It is believed to be the first time the program has ever failed to propagate a major virus. 
“Frankly, we’ve never heard of a virus that couldn’t spread through Microsoft Outlook, so our findings were, to say the least, unexpected,” said Clive Sarnow, director of the CDC’s infectious disease unit. 
The study was immediately hailed by British officials, who said it will save millions of pounds and thousands of man hours. “Up until now we have, quite naturally, assumed that both foot-and-mouth and mad cow were spread by Microsoft Outlook,” said Nick Brown, Britain’s Agriculture Minister. “By eliminating it, we can focus our resources elsewhere.” 
However, researchers in the Netherlands, where foot-and-mouth has recently appeared, said they were not yet prepared to disqualify Outlook, which has been the progenitor of viruses such as “I Love You,” “Bubbleboy,” “Anna Kournikova,” and “Naked Wife,” to name but a few. 
Said Nils Overmars, director of the Molecular Virology Lab at Leiden University: “It’s not that we don’t trust the research, it’s just that as scientists, we are trained to be skeptical of any finding that flies in the face of established truth. And this one flies in the face like a blind drunk sparrow.” 
Executives at Microsoft, meanwhile, were equally skeptical, insisting that Outlook’s patented Virus Transfer Protocol (VTP) has proven virtually pervious to any virus. The company, however, will issue a free VTP patch if it turns out the application is not vulnerable to foot-and-mouth. 
Such an admission would be embarrassing for the software giant, but Symantec virologist Ariel Kologne insisted that no one is more humiliated by the study than she is. “Only last week, I had a reporter ask if the foot-and-mouth virus spreads through Microsoft Outlook, and I told him, ‘Doesn’t everything?'” she recalled. “Who would’ve thought?”

"HUMAN EMBRYO CLONED:  CAN ""CHAIN"" STORES, ""SUBDIVISIONS,"" BE FAR BEHIND?",admin,https://www.satirewire.com/human-embryo-cloned-can-chain-stores-subdivisions-be-far-behind/,"

Sheep-Like Inhabitants Would Prefer Similar Styles in Music, TV, Cars
Berkeley, Calif. (SatireWire.com) – News that a U.S. company has cloned a human embryo has sent shock waves through the bioethical community, which warns that a world populated by clones would be totally unrecognizable to us – a macabre, doppleganger environment in which like-minded inhabitants shop at cookie-cutter “chain” stores, apishly watch television shows patterned after the same theme, and even run their computers with the same operating system.





Artist's conception of a restaurant that might be popular with clones.





“We must oppose embryo cloning because eventually it will lead to a world of full-grown human clones, a vastly different place where the inhabitants behave like sheep,” said Francis Curmud, chairman of the bioethics department at the University of California. For instance, Curmud explained, a company might open a fast-food restaurant in California, then open thousands of other restaurants exactly like it around the world, “and even if the food were horrible, the clone people would go there without giving it much thought.”
“You could even, theoretically, have most of the world’s computers running the same software, perhaps even made by the same company, and everyone would think that was normal,” he added darkly.
While it may seem like something out of science fiction, many insist clones would be naturally predisposed to such similitude, and caution that cloneish behavior would be evident in every facet of life. In finance, people would obtain credit cards, not because they really needed them, but because everyone else had them. In the media, television stations thousands of miles apart would hire fungible newscasters who looked and acted the same. Even the arts would be homogenized, lamented Jive Records President Barry Weiss.
“Let’s say Band A has five young men who sing and dance,” said Weiss. “Well, in the clone world, Band B would be created to look and sound exactly the same, and instead of being appalled or put off, clone consumers would actually buy up the music of both bands as if they were somehow different.”





In a clone world, unique vehicle designs such as these would be unimaginable.





One of the most chilling examples of the clone lifestyle, however, would be in the more mundane world of residential housing, where buyers would consent to live in what architectural theorists have chillingly labeled “subdivisions.”
In subdivisions, builders would make homes that all looked alike, and they would place them next to each other in such a way that one street would be indistinguishable from the next, said David Wanamung, an architectural futurist at Washington University in St. Louis.
These subdivisions would be located in what Wanamung termed “suburbs” – vast expanses of land that would also feature “chain” stores. These homogenous, often massive marketplaces would offer clones the same coffee or toys or electronics from Boston to Boise to Baton Rouge. And these stores, he theorized, would probably be grouped together along glaringly ugly commercial corridors, or clumped into mammoth cubes called “malls.”
“You could, quite literally, be driving on the outskirts of Houston and not know if you were actually in Atlanta or Minneapolis,” said Wanamung. “I don’t think that’s a world I would want to live in, if you called it ‘living’ at all.”
Even the most tenacious alarmists concede that cloning a human embryo is a far cry from populating an entire planet with clones, but until Congress acts to halt such research, they say they will refuse to back down from their worst-case worldview.
“All of this may seem frightening, but we have to understand how bizarre and alien a clone-led world would be,” said Louise Permeseus, acting director of Manhattan-based Clone Watch. “In their blind quest for duplication, it is possible they might even vote for a President of the United States, not because he was highly qualified, but simply because he had a name identical to a previous president.”

COMPUTER VIRUS MAKING TO BE PROSECUTED AS HATE CRIME FOR TARGETING STUPID PEOPLE,admin,https://www.satirewire.com/computer-virus-making-to-be-prosecuted-as-hate-crime-for-targeting-stupid-people/,"
Systems Administrators Now On Front Lines of Bias Crime
Washington, D.C. (SatireWire.com) – With yet another email virus spreading across the globe, 41 U.S. states and six European countries today announced that the act of creating an attachment-based computer virus will now be considered a hate crime because it intentionally targets stupid people.







Hate crime victim Bob Fnork (center) is stunned to discover he has just opened another infected attachment.




“In a hate crime, the offender is motivated by the victim’s personal characteristics, and in the case of email viruses, the maker is clearly singling out those who open email attachments when they’ve been told a thousand times not to,” said California Attorney General Bill Lockyer. “Like any other segment of the population, people of stupidity need protection from bias.”
The decision, however, is already causing a firestorm of controversy. In the United States, the American Civil Liberties Union vehemently opposed the action, arguing it runs counter to the spirit of hate crime laws.
“Hate crime statutes are specifically designed to protect minority groups,” said ACLU President Nadine Strossen. “I’m not sure the number of stupid computer users meets that criterion.”
France, meanwhile, said it would not prosecute anyone willing to write a virus in French.
But in London, the British Civil Idiots Union applauded the move, arguing that virus-based hate crimes cause victims to suffer psychological harm. “Every time we pass on one of these emails, our self-esteem is shattered when we are forced to publicize our condition,” said CIU President Michael Overly. “It’s always a shock to my system every time I have to write, “Hey everybody, if you get an email attachment from me, don’t open it! I just found out my computer got infected by a virus! Sorry!”
In identifying virus-based hate crime activity, U.S. and European law enforcement authorities said they will focus on anyone creating a virus delivered via email attachment that contains either no subject line or a vague subject line such as “Hey, check this out!” “I saw this and thought of you!” or “I am wanting to get your opinion on this.”
Congressional leaders also said they will amend the 1990 Hate Crimes Statistics Act and require the FBI to track data on crimes based on race, religion, sexual orientation, ethnicity, or stupidity. As a result, some experts expect the annual number of hate crimes in the U.S. alone to jump from 6,500 to 132 million.
Others believe the actual number will be higher, but say many crimes will go unreported because the victim refuses to recognize what has happened. Dallas, Texas resident Mike Smith is a case in point.
“I am not a victim of a hate crime because I am not stupid,” said Smith. “I got an email with an attachment from my buddy in Phoenix, so naturally, I opened it. What’s so stupid about that?”
What, Smith was asked, did the email say?
“It said, ‘I_love_you.’ Why?”
In Moline, Ill., police have already made their first arrest under the expanded laws. Matthew Spere, a 17-year-old high school senior, was taken into custody this morning after police said he had created and propagated a variant of the “Goner” virus. In a phone interview, Spere denied the charges. “My virus wasn’t targeting stupid computer users specifically, just anyone using Microsoft’s Outlook Express or AOL,” he said. “Oh… damn.”

2000 THE INTERNET YEAR IN REVIEW: Oct-Dec,admin,https://www.satirewire.com/2000-the-internet-year-in-review-oct-dec/,"
OCTOBER
 
¤ Vice President Al Gore puts the Internet up for sale on auction site eBay, explaining that while he will miss his creation, he needs money to duel Republican presidential contender George W. Bush in the stretch run to November. 
¤ America Online announces that new members will get free Internet access for the rest of the year during the first month. 
¤ In submitting its proposed schedule for the appeals court trial, Microsoft denies it is stalling, arguing there is nothing unusual about its 300-page brief, which is written in Olde Norse. 
¤ Just days after pop diva Madonna won a battle to wrest control of Madonna.com by arguing she was the world’s best known Madonna, Attorney General Janet Reno employs a similar argument to win the rights to VirginMary.com. Several alleged virgins, many named Mary, attempt to win the domain, but Judge Harvey Winston decides to award the domain to the Attorney General without testing her, and despite her non-Mary status. “Is Janet Reno named Mary? No,” writes Judge Winston. “Is Janet Reno a virgin? That, frankly, is a question this court is not willing to contemplate.” 
¤ Microsoft executives continue to insist that whoever hacked into their computer system did not gain access to the source codes of its major products. However, Redmond officials concede they may never learn the identity of the culprit or culprits. In an unrelated note, Sun Microsystems surprises industry observers by releasing Sun Office, Sun NT, and Sun 2000. 
NOVEMBER 
¤ Hewlett Packard, the nation’s No. 2 computer and office equipment maker, discloses it doesn’t have anywhere to go for Thanksgiving and is “putting out feelers.” Interested parties should expect 83,200 for dinner. Yorkshire pudding: 43,500. Just cornbread: 39,700. 
¤ A computer virus labeled “CokeSpill,” which mimics the spill of a Coca-Cola on a keyboard, infects computers at Innnntel, Suuuuun Microooosystems and DDDDellll, says a spokesman for Syyyyyymmmmmantec, whose network is also infected. 
¤ As part of its staff cuts, online auction site eBay says it will auction its employees off individually. To increase interest, eBay pairs each outgoing staffer with a fine collectible. On day one, bidding on human-resources-manager- Claudia-Penton-with-a-set-of-Mr.-Peanut- snack-cups is slow, but the action on marketing-director-Randy-Keller-with- a-hand-painted-Limoges-sardine-server is quite hectic. Explains Keller: “I think it’s obvious why my bids are moving. I have six years experience in product positioning and demand planning, and come with a matching server tray.” 
¤ Priceline announces that the press release it posted a year ago claiming the company would break even in 2001 was missing a comma. The actual phrase should have been “the company will break, even in 2001.” 
¤ After years of anticipation and with great fanfare, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers unveils seven new and badly needed top level domains to join .com, .org, and .net. Among the seven are .coop, .museum, and .aero. Honestly. 









DECEMBER 
¤ The world’s 14 remaining users of the Netscape browser exult over the release of Netscape 6, the first new version of the browser in two years, and a product Netscape executives predict will blow away Microsoft’s Internet Explorer “if this were 1997.” To solidify its market position, Netscape senior vice president Jim Martin announces a “major” partnership with Apple Computer to have Netscape 6 installed on all new Apple machines, a move that Martin boasts will really break Microsoft’s stranglehold on the browser market, “if this were, say, 1984.” 
¤ In response to Intel’s statement that it will produce transistors only three atoms wide by 2005, rival chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices announces that most of its employees are no more than 14 inches tall. AMD, however, refuses to allow reporters into its facilities to verify the claim. “We would, but we can’t reach the doorknobs to let you in,” spokesman Ravi Chalani says in a phone interview. 
¤ The clichÃ©s about how the Internet has brought people together and made the world smaller turn out to be true, as Swedish researchers report that Earth is now just 19 miles across, and that its 6 billion inhabitants are stacked 842-high on a piece of land the size Bimini. 
¤ Linux continues to make inroads in the operating system market by winning support from companies such as IBM and Dell. Microsoft appeals. 
¤ With CMGI at $6, Priceline at $1.50, InfoSpace at $7 and Fogdog at 66 cents, Internet investors issue a “strong hit” on analysts Tim Fogarty, John Ryding, Ullas Naik, Laura Pavlenko, Henry Blodget, and Larry Rice.

SOMALIS LIVE IN FEAR OF LOOMING INTERNET BUBBLE,admin,https://www.satirewire.com/somalis-live-in-fear-of-looming-internet-bubble/,"
Rival Tribe Leaders Claim They Can Stop Giant Bubble from Devestation
MOGADISHU, SOMALIA (SatireWire.com) – Red Cross officials in Somalia, which in September became the last African nation to go online, appealed for calm today as the country anxiously awaits the Great Internet Bubble, which many fear will wreak havoc on their villages, livestock, and loved ones.
“It is said that once you are on this Internet, it is inevitable that the Great Bubble will come for you,” bemoaned Issaq tribesman Siad Barre, who stood guard outside his home with a rusted AK-47. “I have heard it appears like a thief in the night and will steal our goats and children.”









“No no, the Great Bubble is made of sand,” said Barre’s neighbor, Farah Abgaal. “It rides the wind and will swallow us whole. That gun is no use, Siad. You are a fool.”
Both Abgaal and Barre dismissed as “Western lies” the Red Cross’ explanation that the so-called Internet Bubble is not some kind of animal or phantom, but an economic term to describe a period of intense speculation. Instead, they heed the counsel of clan leaders who warn that the Great Bubble has devoured America and much of Europe, and will soon come for them.
In a speech in downtown Mogadishu last night, Gen. Gidir Muhammed warned people to be on the lookout for “mighty portents and omens” that will precede the Bubble’s arrival. “First we will behold the Vile Infusion of the Venture Capitalists, who will offer us riches in return for our enslavement,” said Muhammed. “Then will come the evil Dotcoms, who will take over our coffee houses and seduce us with jobs of great promise.”
Muhammed predicted that he alone could stop the Bubble, but only if rival clans rallied around him and killed his enemies.
In response to the speech, roving thugs immediately executed 145 businessmen. “They were agents of the Great Bubble,” one soldier explained. “It has the fangs of a boar and arrives in a Hummer.”
Asked if he actually believed that, the soldier became quiet for a moment, then whispered, “Not really. We just talk like this to get on CNN. How’d Intel do today? My E*Trade account is down again.”
Added Siad Barre, still holding his AK-47: “We will see who is the fool, Farrah Abgaal, when the Bubble makes kishwari with your wife!”

Nuke Waste Repository Could Turn Moon Into Wasteland,admin,https://www.satirewire.com/nuke-waste-repository-could-turn-moon-into-wasteland/,"
Reno, Nev. (SatireWire.com) – President Bush blasted a plan unveiled Thursday that calls for depositing nuclear waste on the Moon, arguing the radioactive material could turn the lunar surface into a vast, uninhabitable wasteland. 
“Imagine a place where nothing would grow, where naturally occurring life would be nonexistent, where humans would only be able to survive by wearing special suits and breathing through air tanks,” said Bush, who favors Yucca Mountain, Nev., as a national waste repository. 
“If this idea of burying nuclear waste on the Moon comes to pass, then what you’d be left with up there is nothing but a great big lifeless hunk of rock.” 
The lunar idea, proposed by Sherwin Gormly, an environmental engineer for Reno, Nev.-based Tetra Tech EM Inc., would carry waste to the Moon on missiles that, if they escaped Earth intact, would theoretically drive into the lunar surface and bury the cargo. Because the Moon has no hydrosphere, Gormly insisted the problem of waste migration – the contamination of groundwater – would be eliminated. Bush, however, reasoned that the absence of water would only make detection more difficult. 
“In Nevada, we’ll know if the water’s contaminated ’cause it will show up in tests,” he said. “But on the Moon, we can’t test it. So we’ll never really know for sure.”

Israel Offers Palestinians Virtual State For Only $49.95 a Month,admin,https://www.satirewire.com/israel-offers-palestinians-virtual-state-for-only-49-95-a-month/,"
Jerusalem (SatireWire.com) – Proposing a compromise he hopes will ensure his nation’s security, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak announced Israel will allow the Palestinians to form an independent nation, but only on the Internet. 
The offer calls for the Palestinians to take up residence on a shared Israeli Web server, but otherwise allows them to “control their own destiny,” insisted Barak, who added the Palestinians would be responsible for their own virtual police, education, and technical support. The Palestinians would pay Israel $49.95 a month to host the space, or $69.95 for the special “Deluxe Virtual Nation Package,” which includes Microsoft’s Site Server Commerce Edition 3.0. 
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, who is on record demanding that a separate Palestine be carved out of the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and eastern Jerusalem, quickly attacked the proposal. “We have ‘shared’ our space with Israel long enough,” Arafat said in a statement. “I will not sit down with Mr. Barak’s government unless they guarantee us a fully-dedicated, independent server. And they must waive the $25 set-up fee.”

Betrayed Shareholders Not Particularly Interested in Routers, Switches
San Jose, Cal. (SatireWire.com) – The rumors about Cisco Systems have been circulating for months, but the earnings warning and plunge in its share price Tuesday left little doubt in investors’ minds that Cisco is not just a famous stock, but may in fact have been operating as a large company that makes complex and incomprehensible equipment related to high technology.









“I got into Cisco two years ago because I was made to understand it was really the tech stock to own,” said Cisco shareholder Anthony Timson of Rahway, N.J. “Honestly, it never occurred to me that there was anything more to it. Frankly, I feel betrayed.”
Once considered the core high-tech holding, Cisco has watched its share price fall 80 percent from last year’s peak. As a result, much more attention lately has been given to the company’s market share, revenues, and products, such as routers, switches, and Virtual Private Network concentrators. Rarely, if ever, is Cisco simply identified as a highly recommended stock or “surefire” high tech bet.
While Cisco CEO John Chambers said he is sorry investors have had to learn about the company this way, he believes the public defrocking will be good in the long run.
“Until recently, the only reason many people had heard of Cisco was because our stock was famous,” he said. “Now people will get to know us for what we do. We’ll be just like any other high tech company.”
Timson, however, disagreed. “Other high tech companies make shit I can understand,” he said.

"ENERGY COMPROMISE CALLS FOR BURNING FOSSIL FUELS, ENVIRONMENTAL ACTIVISTS",admin,https://www.satirewire.com/energy-compromise-calls-for-burningfossil-fuels-environmental-activists/,"
 Alternate “Green Fuel” Non-Renewable, But Won’t Require Drilling 
Washington, D.C. (SatireWire.com) — In a compromise that calls for the left and right to work together, energy company executives today proposed burning both fossil fuels and environmental activists, who officials estimated may be able to provide 2 percent of the country’s energy output “for a couple of hours, anyway.” 









“It doesn’t sound like much, but I think the environmental lobby would agree that every little bit helps,” said Giles Fermat, president of the National Energy Producers Association, which will voluntarily foot the bill to refit plants. 
Environmentalists, however, were split over their use as so-called “green fuel.” In California, Sierra Club spokesman Martin Gallagher blasted the proposal as “another short-term fix” that would do little to decrease the nation’s energy dependence. Like oil, he insisted, people who closely follow environmental issues are a non-renewable source of energy. 
“The burning of environmental activists will provide only a brief respite, and may eventually discourage others from becoming environmental activists,” said Gallagher. “Once we’ve been depleted, what then?” 
“Then we’ll drill in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge,” replied Fermat. 
“Over my dead body!” countered Gallagher. “Oh… right.” 
At an emergency meeting of Greenpeace, meanwhile, officers conceded the plan would encourage the group’s 2.5 million members to be “really, really active activists – well, for a short while.” They also noted the alternative source of energy would not require the harmful drilling or strip-mining used to extract other forms of fuel. 
Several members, however, complained that vehicles used to transport activists to power facilities would further pollute the environment. The issue was settled when members voted to walk to the plants.

MAD COWS USE CELL PHONES,admin,https://www.satirewire.com/mad-cows-use-cell-phones/,"
Researchers Claim Discovery Solves Mystery Disease 
Kent, England (SatireWire.com) – In another blow to the cellular industry, British scientists studying Mad Cow disease claim to have discovered the source of the mysterious affliction after catching a pair of Friesian Holsteins chatting away on mobile phones, which also have been linked to eye cancer and brain dysfunction.









“We knew mobile phones were dangerous, and we knew cows were intrigued by wireless technology, but when we saw them using the mobiles, we made the connection right away,” said lead researcher Kevin Barrington, who spotted the culprits at a dairy farm outside Kent. Listening in on the conversation, Barrington said he never heard the cows utter a word. “Bloody typical cell phone user,” he noted. “Nothing to say.”
Cell phone manufacturers – already plagued by studies connecting cell phones to cancers and brain abnormalities – immediately dismissed the British claims. “To even insinuate that cell phones could somehow be the cause of this disease is as absurd as the notion that cows could use cell phones at all,” said Nokia spokesperson Nigel Wanthorpe. However, after being shown a photograph (at right) taken by researchers, Wanthorpe demurred. “Dear God in Heaven,” he said, “what have we done?”
John Ashton, who runs a cattle operation outside Essex, admitted that like many farmers, he has been using cell phones to communicate with his herd for years. “Mostly I’d ring ’em up to tell ’em when it was time to come in for the slaughter,” he explained. “I’d say, ‘ello, Melissa? You and Elsie and Camille come in so’s I can stun you into a stupor an’ slit your throats, awright?’ Saved me time ‘aving to round ’em up, and I didn’t ‘ave look in those big brown eyes.”
However, once Ashton learned of the connection to the disease, he took the phones away. “That was not at all pleasant,” he added. “With all due respect, I don’t think you ‘ave really seen a mad cow until you take away its mobile.”
Prior to the discovery, scientists had theorized that Mad Cow, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy, was caused by mutated proteins called prions, or possibly by widespread tobacco use. Tobacco was ruled out as a suspect last year, however, after a study found that while cigarette smoking among cows had dropped 45 percent from 1995 to 2000, incidents of BSE had recently increased.
The cell phone diagnosis, however, gives victims and cattle farmers hope that the disease can be treated by prohibiting livestock from using cellular technology, and that they can now sue the burgeoning wireless industry ex puga amplus, which is a legal term for half a million pounds.
British Agriculture Minister Nick Brown, meanwhile, lashed out at the cows for further endangering the community by not using hands-free devices.

ICANN Meets Urgent Demand by Adding .Aero, .Coop, and .Museum Domains
MARINA DEL RAY, CAL. (SatireWire.com) – In an historic vote Thursday, the agency that oversees the Internet address system chose seven new Top Level Domains to go with .com, .net, and .org – a decision based almost entirely on how weird the new domains were.









Led by Chairman Esther Dyson, board members for the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) spent six hours debating and voting on the so-called generic TLDs, and in the end came up with .pro, .aero, .museum, .name, .biz, .info, and .coop., while ignoring popular proposals such as .web, .kids, and .xxx.
Six hours. For .coop.
How did they possibly manage it? The transcript follows. (Board member names have been replaced by numbers to avoid embarrassment.)
Dyson: OK everyone, today we finally vote on which new top level domains to add, and I want to get things moving, so let’s take a look at the first name – .coop.
BM #1: What, like for chickens? 
BM #2: This is dumb. How many chicken farmers have Web sites? 
BM #3: I think something more universal, like .farm. Not every farmer has chickens.
BM #5: I think some are allergic to the feathers.
Dyson: No, listen. Cooperatives, like co-ops. Credit unions, rural electric consortiums…
BM #4: The application says there are something like 750,000 of them. That’s a lot more than there are chicken farms. 
BM #2: Yes, I say approve it, but for these credit unions, not the chicken farms. 
 APPROVED
Dyson: Next we have .pro. It’s for professionals.
BM #1: Define professionals. 
BM #7: Doctors, lawyers, accountants… 
BM #3: Wrestlers. I think they’re professionals. Like in WWF. 
BM #2: But it’s fake. I don’t like that they could be included. 
BM #6: Yes, I vote that wrestling should not be faked. 
BM #8: What if we just say .pro can’t include any fake professions? 
BM #3: Yes, that way we could exclude wrestling and journalism. 
BM #1: All in favor? 
 APPROVED
Dyson: Here’s another interesting one, .museum. 
BM #1: Seems kind of arbitrary, .museum. Why not have .ballet or .opera? 
BM #5: Besides, what about .org? Isn’t that supposed to be for non-profits? 
BM #9: No, that’s .com.
BM #4: I don’t know. Give me one good reason why we should approve this? 
BM #3: Hey, no fair imposing new restrictions now. We haven’t needed a good reason before. 
Dyson: All in favor of having no good reason? 
 APPROVED
Dyson: What about .web? 
BM #1: That’s by far the most popular nomination. 
BM #6: Yes, of all the TLDs, I think it’s the one people expect us to approve. 
Dyson: So we’re all agreed? 
BM #4: Yes, let’s scrap it. 
 DENIED
Dyson: Next up, .name. 
BM #8: This would be for people’s names, personal Web sites? 
BM #2: I foresee major litigation issues. What if two people have the same name? 
BM #5: Could fathers and sons sue each other? 
BM #3: I think fathers should win. They had the name first. Eminent domain, so to speak. 
Dyson: We’re not here to settle legal issues. We’re here to pick new TLDs. 
BM #2: That’s easy for you to say. Your name’s Esther Dyson. I bet your father wasn’t named Esther Dyson.
BM #9: Look, I say we approve it. We’re looking for “generic” Top Level Domains, and .name is pretty generic. 
BM #1: Ooo, good catch #9. 
 APPROVED
Dyson: And now we’re on to .biz. It’s for business. To compete with .com
BM #8: It’s really slang, this .biz. 
BM#6: Why not .bus for business?
BM#2: Nah, sounds like bus companies.
BM #4: Well, the French won’t like .biz. Too American. I guess we could tell them it stands for bizarre.
BM #5: But why use American slang? Why not that universal language, Esperanto? How do you say ‘business’ in Esperanto? 
BM #8: Komerci. 
BM #3: That would make it… hmmm.. .kom! That has a nice ring to it. 
BM #4: It does sound familiar. That’s an advantage. 
BM #3: I move to approve .kom.
 APPROVED
Dyson: Jesus. We can’t approve .kom. No one has submitted .kom, and anyway, it sounds like .com. It would be confusing. 
BM #3: We’re not here to not be confusing. 
BM #4: Yes, you’re changing our mandate again. 
BM #3: Right. People have been demanding new TLDs for years, and all we come up with are domains for credit unions and museums. 
Dyson: What’s your point? 
BM #3: I have no point. That’s why I voted for .museum and .coop. 
Dyson: But what about .biz? 
BM #5: That was one of the originals, right? Along with .net and .org? 
BM #7: Are we voting on those, too? I vote we get rid of .net. Just to screw with Microsoft and their .NET thing. 
Dyson: No, .biz would be new. Let’s approve it. 
BM #1: Why? 
Dyson: It’s almost time for lunch. 
 APPROVED
Dyson: Next we have .aero
BM #6: OK, five points for style, but how many Aerosmith sites can there be, really? 
BM #2: Uh-oh. Steven.Tyler.name. 
BM #8: What? 
BM #2: Aerosmith’s lead singer. He’s got a very common name. I’ll bet that one winds up in court. 
Dyson:  Listen, it doesn’t stand for ‘Aerosmith.’ It stands for aeroplane. 
BM #4: You’re saying ‘airplane’ kinda funny. 
Dyson: It’s French. A French consortium proposed the .aero domain. 
BM #3: Hey, no fair. They already have .bizarre. 
BM #9: That’s .biz
Dyson: No, Aeroplane. It’s for the travel industry. 
BM #1: Why just aeroplane? Why not .train or .bus? 
BM #8: I thought we said we couldn’t do bus companies.
BM #7: I move to approve .aero
BM #8: I move to approve of bus companies! 
BM #2: I second aero. That way Steven could use Steven.Tyler.aero.
 APPROVED
Dyson: And lastly, we have .info. 
BM #1: A domain just for infomercials? 
Dyson: No, for information. It’s to compete with .com also. 
BM #6: So companies are going to want, say, generalmotors.info? Gee, that’s catchy. 
BM #4: I agree, I don’t think anyone will want to use this domain. 
BM #8: Yes, I like it too. It meets our mandate of approving TLDs nobody wants. 
 APPROVED
Dyson: I’d like to thank you all for coming here today. If there’s no further business… 
BM #9: We didn’t talk about .kids and .xxx, two TLDs everyone was clamoring for. 
Dyson: Yes, we agreed not to consider those. People are concerned that kids will sneak onto .xxx, and that sex fiends will get onto .kids. 
BM #9: I was thinking about that. What if we make the .kids domain for adult-only stuff, since that’s who really wants to go there, and we make .xxx for kids sites, since kids really want to go there. 
Dyson: Good Lord, that would be entirely arbitrary and confusing.
(pause)
BM #3: Our mandate! 
Dyson: I’ll put it on the schedule.

“I See Dead Dot-Coms” 







Read ACT ONE.


Read ACT THREE.




Act II, Scene I 
Malcolm is in another chat session with Cole08. 
COLE08: I want to tell you my secret.
 DRMALCOLM: OK.
 COLE08: I see dead dot-coms.
 DRMALCOLM: Where? On the news?
 COLE08: No, all the time. Walking around, like regular people.  They can’t see each other. Some of them don’t know they’re dead.
 DRMALCOLM: I am sitting motionless, transfixed. Go on.
 COLE08: They tell me stories…  Things that happened to their e-businesses…  There are more of them every day.
 DRMALCOLM: How do you know they’re dead dot-coms and not just, you know, regular dead businesses?
 COLE08: They talk about the dangers of being profitable too soon They think banner ads will make them a lot of money. They only see what they want to see, hear what they want to hear.
 DRMALCOLM: I am shocked, visibly dismayed, and clearly don’t believe you. But just in case… they don’t tell you who’s going to die next, do they? Cause I’ve got, like, 2,000 shares of Salon.com and I’m starting to wonder…
 COLE08: They scare me.
 DRMALCOLM: Of course they do… wait… who scares you? The dead dot-coms, or Salon.com? You think I should sell?

Act II, Scene II 
Malcolm’s basement office. He is sitting at the computer when Cole08 logs into the chat room. 
COLE08: I’m sitting here frozen to the spot, trembling slightly. Very pale.
 DRMALCOLM: What is it? What do you see?
 COLE08: I see three adults. Not so old. They are hanging around an office. They are waving their stock options in my face. The stock options are all wet. I don’t understand.
 DRMALCOLM: Those wet stock options would mean their options are what they call “under water.” It means, basically, their stock is worthless.
 COLE08: Great. Now I’ve got all this water on me. I’m soaked. People will think I did it to myself; or my mom did it. Make them leave.
 DRMALCOLM: I’m working on it. Any word on Salon? 
Act II, Scene III 
Exterior, a downtown street. Malcolm is walking along, speaking into a tape recorder. 
MALCOLM: Cole08 is worse than I thought. Hallucinations, paranoia. Hospitalization may be required. (then softly, dejectedly) I may have to sell my Salon stock. 
Malcolm stops in front of an antique shop; his wife’s shop. Inside, he sees Anna pick up the phone. He can hear her talking. 
ANNA: Hi darling. Yes, I miss you too. I can’t wait till you’re home. 
 
She pauses and listens to the other person speak. 
ANNA: I know. Some business trips are long. Well, I love you. 
Just then, she starts to pucker her lips. It is clear she is cheating on Malcolm and is going to make kissy sounds into the phone with this jerk. Suddenly, the glass in the front door of the shop shatters! Anna cannot make her kissy sound! She rushes to the front door and looks down the street. She sees no one. 
Act II, Scene IV 
Malcolm’s basement office. He is on the computer, chatting with Cole08. 
DRMALCOLM: I don’t have any questions for you.
 COLE08: You are sad. Let me ask you a question. What do you want most?
 DRMALCOLM: I want my wife to talk to me again. So I’m going to give up on you, send you to someone else.
 COLE08: Don’t give up on  me. You’re the only one who can help me now.
 DRMALCOLM: No, you’re wrong. I can’t help you until Act II, Scene VI. 
Act II, Scene V 
Malcolm’s basement. He is reading the transcript of an old chat session with freakmeister96@aol.com. Halfway through the transcript of the session, Malcolm writes that he has to go to the bathroom and tells freakmeister he’ll be right back. Then Malcolm reads on and sees what happens while he was gone: 
FREAKMEISTER: I’m getting scared and it’s very cold and my breathing is rapid.
 ANONYMOUS USER: But my bookshop is unique… I know we can’t compete on cost and inventory… but people like to touch books before they buy… No, I’ve been Amazoned!
 FREAKMEISTER: I am catatonic with fear!
 MALCOLM: Hi, I’m back. Whooo, really had to go. Where we were? 
Malcolm’s eyes open wide in disbelief. He closes the transcript. 
MALCOLM (muttering): How did I miss this? Why did I have to go to the bathroom just then? 
Malcolm squirms in his seat. It is clear from the look on his face that he is seriously concerned about Cole08, and his prostate health. 
Act II, Scene VI 
Malcolm’s basement. Another chat session with Cole08. 
COLE08: You OK? Something happened, didn’t it?
 DRMALCOLM: Yes. These dot-coms that died and are still hanging around. Maybe they weren’t ready to go.
 COLE08: Hey, you sound better. Taking Prostatonin?
 DRMALCOLM: Maybe they wake up that morning thinking they have a thousand deals to make and a multimillion dollar budget to do it with… And then all of a sudden, boom. Reality hits. The Nasdaq drops. It’s all just… gone.
 COLE08: That’s why they’re so mad.
 DRMALCOLM: What do those ghosts want when they talk to you?  Think real careful now, Cole.
 COLE08: Help. Sorry… let me pause thoughtfully … ok… Help?
 DRMALCOLM: Yes, that’s it! I think they want help. They just want to be heard! And I think I know how to make them go away.
 COLE08: Invest in old economy companies?
 DRMALCOLM: No!. I think they know you’re one of the rare people who can see them. You need to help them tell their stories.
 COLE08: Even Toysmart? They sold their customer lists to pay their debts, even though they promised customers they’d never do that.
 DRMALCOLM: Yeah, screw them. But talk to everyone else.

SatireWire to Lay Off Half of Staff,admin,https://www.satirewire.com/satirewire-to-lay-off-half-of-staff/,"







New Haven, Conn. (SatireWire.com) – In an effort to appear in sync with the Internet economy, online humor site SatireWire today announced it will lay off 50 percent of its staff, or approximately one person, by year’s end. 
According to SatireWire editor Treat Warland, the layoff of chief copy editor Calista Littlenod is necessary in order to make it appear as if he were streamlining operations. In addition, he noted, the move is particularly painful due to the fact that Littlenod is not a real person, but a fictional character he created to make the staff seem larger than it is. 
“All I can say is, woe are the times when even fictional dot-com employees must lose their jobs,” Warland declared. 
To facilitate the layoff, Warland said SatireWire would take a charge against fourth quarter earnings, if the company had any earnings. Littlenod, meanwhile, had nothing but praise for SatireWire. “All those people, that whole staff, is just great,” she said.

New York, N.Y. (SatireWire.com) – Reacting to an alarming new report that warns of a widening “digital divide” between those who have Internet access and those who don’t, the United Nations last week launched HaveNot.org, a community and commerce site targeted at the estimated 5 billion people who do not have access to the Internet. According to HaveNot director Anthawal Nadretee, traffic so far “has been very slow, which we think is encouraging.”

"KNIVES, TANKS, WHALES – AIRPORT SCREENERS NOW FAILING TO CATCH ANYTHING",admin,https://www.satirewire.com/knives-tanks-whales-ae-airport-screeners-now-failing-to-catch-anything/,"
 Federal Investigators, Meanwhile, Accused of Enjoying Work a Little Too Much 
WASHINGTON D.C. (SatireWire.com) — In a troubling sign that investigators may be getting bored with their success smuggling guns and knives onto airplanes, the U.S. Department of Transportation today disclosed that its agents have recently cleared airport security checkpoints with an M1 tank, a beluga whale, and a fully active South American volcano. 




 
An undercover DOT investigator attempts to sneak a beluga whale past security at Kennedy Airport.




DOT investigators also boasted that they have repeatedly slipped past screeners with a six-burner Viking stove, the Field Museum of Natural History, and actor Sidney Poitier, whom they had gagged and, for some reason, painted bright blue. 
The revelations were disturbing for DOT inspector general Kenneth Mead, who praised his employees for their previous work in uncovering security lapses, but suggested investigators had perhaps lost sight of their original mission. At a staff meeting yesterday, Mead urged agents to “give it a rest,” and, at some point, return the Washington Monument. 
“Oh yeah, that was a good one,” said Mitch Kerling, one of hundreds of DOT field personnel assigned to test security. “Twelve out of 13 airports. Zoom. Right through. Only got caught at LAX because this one screener thought it was a knife.” 
Like Kerling, other DOT agents said they weren’t ready to comply with Mead’s cease-and-desist order, arguing that more serious lapses have yet to be discovered. But Argenbright Security CEO David Beaton, who runs the nation’s largest airport screening company, said he failed to see how sneaking the Central Park merry-go-round past security was productive. 
Replied DOT field analyst Diane Corliss: “So?” 
In defending his staff, Beaton insisted employees weren’t trained to spot geologic catastrophes or Sidney Poitier, although he conceded a routine hand check should have detected former R.E.M. guitarist Peter Buck, whom agents had set on fire and placed in a golf bag. However, Beaton claimed investigators have also overlooked many security successes. In particular, he praised one employee for recently confiscating a pair of scissors from a man attempting to board a flight for Phoenix. 









The man, actually an undercover DOT investigator, noted in his report that the scissors were taken, but added that he was then allowed to board the plane while driving a mobile rocket launcher. 
“Security thought that was a sweater,” Beaton explained. 
Officials from the Federal Aviation Administration, meanwhile, said safety should improve by November, when federally-employed screeners are slated to be in place at all 429 commercial airports in the United States. DOT investigators, however, said they were up for the challenge, and had already mounted the remains of 16th Century French theologian John Calvin to a live cow.

SCIENTISTS WARN OF GLOBAL COINCIDENCE,admin,https://www.satirewire.com/scientists-warn-of-global-coincidence/,"
Rising Temps, Oceans, and Greenhouse Gas Proof of Weird, Unrelated Happenings 
Washington, D.C. (SatireWire.com) – Sea levels swelled, but still they doubted. Temperatures soared, but still they questioned. Glaciers disappeared, yet even so, they refused to believe. But now, the sudden disintegration of a massive Antarctic ice shelf may have convinced even the most hardened skeptics that Earth truly is threatened by Global Coincidence. 







 Antarctica’s Larsen B ice shelf before (above) and after Global Coincidence caused its destruction.







“If there was before, there can be no doubt now that there is one very obvious reason why all these things are happening,” said Dr. Milton Suter of the Center for Climatological Happenstance. “And that reason is: Because they are.” 
The numbers supporting Global Coincidence, Suter insisted, don’t lie. In the last 100 years, while carbon dioxide and methane emissions have surged, the world’s average land surface temperature has risen 1.0ºF, and the oceans have risen 6 to 8 inches. “For most people, that would be enough,” Suter noted. “I mean, right there, all that adds up to a pretty strange coincidence.” 
But then, over the last month, the 800-square-kilometer Larsen B ice shelf in Antarctica fractured and collapsed. “So on top of everything else, a 500-billion-ton chunk of ice just happens to melt and break apart? Frankly, that’s not just a coincidence,” said Suter, “that’s an incredible coincidence.” 
Polls show that Global Coincidence theory has long been embraced by the general public, but a handful of scientists remain skeptical. “I’ve seen their data, and I still wonder if perhaps there’s not some kind of cause-and-effect relationship that we should be addressing,” said Dr. Kathryn Burke of the Sierra Club. “I believe Global Coincidence may be one possible scenario, but we need to do more studies, including some that point to possible linkages between events, if they exist.” 
That kind of reaction angers Global Coincidence proponents like Dr. Christian Barstow of the World Climatic Coincidence Fund. “More studies? How long do we have to wait before these apologists realize the results are already in?” he said. “It’s time to accept that Global Coincidence is very real, and that if we don’t do something, it’s only going to get worse. 
“And also if we do do something, it’s only going to get worse,”  he added. “That’s the nature of this beast.” 
SPREADING COINCIDENCE? 
Intrigued by the climate studies, some scientists are now investigating the influence of Global Coincidence in a number of unexplored areas. Researchers at the U.S. State Department are using GC to separate U.S. foreign policy decisions and international reaction to U.S. foreign policy decisions. In health care, Global Coincidence has already produced startling results. 
“Right now, we’re looking at people who die of lung cancer, and people who smoke cigarettes, and we see that often these are the same people,” said Dr. Russell Crowder of the American Tobacco Institute’s new Center for Inescapably Random Occurrences. “I don’t know what the odds are of those things happening independently, but they’ve got to be astronomical.” 
“That’s absurd,” replied Millicent Hu of the American Cancer Society. “The link between cigarettes and cancer is no more a coincidence than if I put two and two together and get four.” 
“Whoa, that’s what happens when I put two and two together!” replied Crowder. “Freaky.” 
“All in all, the data is stunning,” said Suter. “The British growing season is now longer than ever. The Arctic ice is considerably thinner than it was 50 years ago. The 20th Century’s 10 warmest years all occurred in the last 15 years. Given that, I think I speak for everyone in the Global Coincidence community when I say, ‘Wow. Go figure.'”

COMPANIES RETOOLING FOR GINGER-BASED ECONOMY,admin,https://www.satirewire.com/companies-retooling-for-ginger-based-economy/,"
Intel Wants to Form Gintel Alliance; Greenspan Warns of “Ginger Bubble” 
MANCHESTER, N.H. (SatireWire.com) – Although only a handful of people know the secret identity of “Ginger” – a product that reportedly will be “more important than the World Wide Web,” and make its creator wealthier than Bill Gates – companies across the globe are gearing up for the new Ginger Economy, launching products and services they claim will “seamlessly integrate with the Ginger experience… whatever it is.”









“I don’t want to reveal too much, but let’s just say we put the Gin in Ginger,” boasted Scott McNealy, CEO of Sun Microsystems. McNealy later conceded he hasn’t found out what Ginger is, exactly, but argued that like the Internet, “it isn’t what you know, but whether or not people perceive that you know.”
Merrill Lynch’s new Ginger analyst, Henry Blodget, agreed, and issued Strong Buy ratings on the entire Ginger sector, as soon as it forms.
So far, investors share his faith. Despite yesterday’s warning from Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan that a “Ginger Bubble” was forming, traders sent shares of Virginia-based VA Ginux up 113 points as investors were excited by the newly formed company’s pledge to “provide the best support and training for Ginger’s Linux capabilities… if, you know, it has any.”
In the most telling move, however, chipmaker Intel wasted little time dumping its partnership with Microsoft Windows – the so-called Wintel alliance – for what it’s already calling the Gintel alliance. “Whenever you hear the word ‘Ginger,’ we want you to think ‘Intel Inside,'” said Intel CEO Craig Barrett. “Unless it doesn’t have an inside.”
Meanwhile, the Internet’s governing body, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, is reviewing an emergency request to create a new Ginger domain, which would be rendered as .gin. Companies, however, are not waiting to pledge their allegiance.
“This time, we will not be left behind,” declared Juergen Schrempp, CEO of the recently renamed DaimlerGinger, which will retool its Chrysler factories to meet the expected demand for Ginger-related products. Asked for his reaction to claims that, far from being the next Internet, Ginger is simply a motorized scooter or, at best, nothing more than a media-driven phenomenon, Schrempp turned sarcastic. “Hmmm, let’s review,” he said. “Most people don’t understand it or know what it is. The media claims it will lead to untold riches. So tell me again, how this is different from the Internet?”

2000: THE INTERNET YEAR IN REVIEW,admin,https://www.satirewire.com/2000-the-internet-year-in-review/,"
  








NEW HAVEN, CONN. (SatireWire.com) – Do you remember a time when Napster was going to change the world, and the Microsoft trial was almost entertaining? Remember when Priceline was a $90 stock? Or even a $10 stock? How about $2? We didn’t either, but after extensive research, SatireWire is proud to bring you the Internet Year that Was, a blatantly revisionist reminiscence that promises to be really painful if you’re still holding Fogdog.com.
JANUARY
¤ The H.M.S. Nasdaq begins the new year where it left off the old, steaming to new records, fueled by can’t-miss powerhouses like Fogdog.com, which jumps 33 percent after a J.P. Morgan Securities analyst actually rates the company a strong buy.
 No, really.
¤ Online retailer Outpost.com, which last year ran controversial TV commercials showing gerbils being fired from a cannon, claims it never used actual gerbils. Instead, Outpost executives say, the company dressed week-old kittens in gerbil costumes. The company adds that its current marketing campaign, which features Outpost executives burning tropical rain forests, also does not use actual gerbils.
¤ In response to AOL’s proposed buyout of Time Warner and Ted Turner’s Turner Broadcasting, Yahoo announces it will acquire actress Jane Fonda. AOL labels the acquisition “sloppy seconds.”
¤ Building on its self-professed desire to become the “AOL of Latin America,” StarMedia CEO Fernando Espuelas says the company will enter a two-year period during which dial-up subscribers will be unable to connect to the service most of the time.
¤ Speaking before a group of investment bankers, Hewlett Packard CEO Carly Fiorina announces that unlike the chief executives at competitors Compaq, Dell, Gateway, and Sun Microsystems, she is the only one capable of doing a “herkie.”
¤ As the Microsoft anti-trust trial rages on and the company faces the prospect of a government-imposed breakup, numerous ancillary lawsuits, and potential revenue setbacks, founder Bill Gates selflessly hands over the CEO title to company President Steve Ballmer.
FEBRUARY
¤ The H.M.S. Nasdaq sets a record high at 4,244, prompting Larry Rice, chief investment officer at Josephthal & Co, to actually tell CNET: “Tech, tech, tech. These companies will continue to gain because they won’t be affected by” rising interest rates.
¤ Online advertising network DoubleClick, under fire from the New York state attorney general for its plan to personally identify Web surfers and their habits through its software, denies it ever implemented the scheme and offers to make amends by paying for online subscriptions to “any of the numerous porn sites” the attorney general frequents daily between 11:35 a.m. and 2 p.m. from his Dell XPS D300 office computer running Windows 98 and Netscape Communicator 4.6.
¤ Contradicting the testimony of other Internet firms, Indonesia’s top English-speaking adult site, TurnInToYourOwnDesire.com, tells a Senate panel it is having “no trouble” registering new and valuable .com domains, citing five recent registrations as proof that the need for additional top-level domains is exaggerated:
 · FreeHeatedSex.com
 · YouAreToBeWantingMeBadAreYouNot.com
 · APrizeOfMyWetness.com
 · ComeAtMePresently.com
 · LowValueSex.com
¤ Under pressure to do something about car accidents involving cell phones, the industry-backed Cell Phone Safety Council launches a public service campaign urging users to “scream like hell” before impact, thereby alerting callers on the other end that there is some kind of trouble.
¤ Nearly 92 percent of respondents to an online survey say they have been on the Internet at least once, while 6 percent says they have never been online but hope to do so within the next six months. The remaining 2 percent in the survey, conducted by ZDNet at its Web site, say they have never been online, and have no intention of doing so.
MARCH
¤ In response to AMD’s new 1 gigahertz (1,000 megahertz) chip, Intel says it has developed a 1,001 MHz chip, but AMD downplays the announcement, saying its 1,000 MHz chip really runs at 1,002 MHz. Intel releases a statement claiming there was a typo in its previous announcement, and that the 1,001 MHz chip really runs at 1,003 MHz.
¤ Internet stock watchers get an eerie sense of foreboding when the IPO for http://www.members.aol.com/mypages/madonnafan.htm gains only 92 percent in its first day of trading. A rogue iceberg is sighted on Wall Street.
¤ A spokesman at AMD says the company will not comment about Intel’s latest claim, explaining executives are too busy boxing up AMD’s new 1,004 MHz chips to come to the phone.
¤ ING Barings analyst Tim Fogarty actually issues a “buy” rating on Priceline stock, which soars  above $90.
¤ In an effort to streamline corporate communications and eliminate redundancy, Sun Microsystems issues what it calls its “official and final” statement on the company’s relationship with rival Microsoft: “Microsoft sucks.”.

FIRED DOT-COM WORKERS GRANTED REFUGEE STATUS,admin,https://www.satirewire.com/fired-dot-com-workers-granted-refugee-status/,"
U.N. to Provide Aid to Thousands Forced to Flee Their Jobs 
NEAR EMERYVILLE, CALIF. (SatireWire.com) – Alarmed by “deplorable” conditions at swelling dot-com relocation camps, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees today granted Official Refugee Status to laid off Internet workers, making them eligible for food and medical aid, and discounts on Nerf guns and coffee.









The decree comes two days after U.N. High Commissioner Sadako Ogata toured Silicon Valley’s so-called “Dot-Camp Alpha,” one of two major .U.S. camps providing temporary shelter for the estimated 8,000 dot-commers who have been uprooted from their jobs and their colleagues.
“The conditions at Alpha camp are deplorable,” said Ogata. “There are no working foosball tables, no concierge service, and the pizza is from Domino’s. It’s squalor on a scale the New Economy hasn’t seen.”
Relief workers, who have been lobbying for months to win Refugee Status for dot-campers, say the decision comes none too soon. Many of the refugees have gone weeks without access to email. More than once, the National Guard has been called in to quell intra-camp violence between rival factions, primarily from Amazon.com and price comparison site Productopia.
The Red Cross has been on hand since late May, trucking in tankers of Jolt Cola, and the first physicians from MÃ©decins Sans FrontiÃ¨res (Doctors Without Borders), arrived last week to render medical assistance to those suffering from sprained knees and ankles sustained on the camp’s substandard mountain bike trails.

Conditions in Dot-Camp Beta, located just outside AOL headquarters in Dulles, Va., are said to be worse. The camp is surrounded by mines, allegedly planted by AOL security guards, and the company has repeatedly turned back relief trucks. As a result, Red Cross workers yesterday warned that Camp Beta refugees could face legacy status within 10 days unless AOL allows agencies to supply emergency laptops and mp3 players.
Though AOL refuses to comment on the camps, experts believe the still healthy Internet giant is harassing the exiles because it wants them to “go bug someone else.” But there are fewer and fewer places to turn. In Dot-Camp Beta, nearly 60 percent of the refugees come from public relations or promotions, said Red Cross field organizer Darren Fletcher. “Their chances of finding a new home are slim,” he noted, “and their chances of going back to their old firms are non-existent.”
Even if they could return, many would find their cubicles gone, or occupied by someone else.
“When I was forced out, they actually tore down my cubicle right before my eyes,” said Andrew Weiner, a former content development manager for Furniture.com, and now a Dot-Camp Alpha resident. “And my neighbor Chuck, they moved some guy from BizDev into his spot before he could even…” Weiner then broke down crying and asked to be excused.
 
Like the others, Weiner insisted he will stay in his makeshift shelter, working on his resumÃ©, reading frayed copies of Fast Company that are passed around the camp like gold, and holding out hope that Steve Case will grant him asylum. Barring that, Weiner said he is praying he will at least get an invitation to try out AOL’s new and most excellent rock-climbing wall.

(SatireWire.com) – Nelson Shank has been online since 1998, but according to a new report by the Internet Privacy Association, the 31-year-old database programmer has yet to make a single online purchase, fearing hackers or marketers will steal his Visa Card number, 8099 0788 341 9800 EXP. 12/01, as well as discover that 213-98-8750 is his Social Security number, and that he uses his mother’s maiden name, Vitale, as his AOL password.
“I would like to buy a novel on, say, BookSense.com, but how do I know my information is safe?” said Shank, who told the researchers he was particularly worried that his unlisted phone number, 775-342-4245, would fall into some marketing firm’s hands.









Shank’s response was one of nearly 35,000 gathered in a survey by the Internet Privacy Association, whose stated goal is to “expand awareness of Internet privacy issues through extensive consumer opinion polls and the dissemination of exceptionally valuable demographic information.”
“Study after study has shown that Internet privacy is the number one concern of those going online, and our survey confirmed this, as 80 percent of respondents stated they did not want their personal information shared,” said IPA director Shellie Jorkins.
What makes the IPA study different, Jorkins said, is the level of detail extracted from respondents, and the way in which the IPA plans to use that information in the fight against online privacy invasion.
“We are so concerned about privacy that we want to share our findings with other affected groups, such as marketing database firms, consumer products companies, and credit card issuers,” she said. “We do this because we think marketers, who are so often accused of failing to respect people’s privacy, should know that there are thousands of people with average household incomes of $74,000 who don’t want their information made public.”
By collecting such personally identifiable demographics, she added, “We let these ruthless marketers know that these are not just nameless, faceless consumers, but real people, with real concerns, with real brand loyalties and real obtainable credit card histories.”
In true open source fashion, Jorkins pledged that the IPA would hold none of its information back, including online browsing habits, medical records, and other highly valuable data, which can be sorted into a wide variety of demographic categories on request, and is available for $9,995. Charging for the information, said Jorkins, is one way the IPA ensures that these third parties “are as interested in Internet privacy as we are.”
Susan Demarak, identified in the report as a 29-year-old mother of three who is likely to purchase a mid-size four-door sedan in the next six months, said she was glad to take the survey. “I was happy that someone is out there fighting the good fight on Internet privacy,” said Demarak. “I’ve even forwarded to the IPA the email addresses of 10 friends who I know would like to go on record against online privacy invasion.”

Act I, Scene I 






Read ACT TWO.


Read ACT THREE.




Interior of a home in suburban San Jose. Dr. Malcolm Willis, a psychologist who runs the online therapy site ShrinksOnCall.com, has just returned from the Webby awards with his wife, Anna. She is clutching Malcolm’s Webby. They go upstairs, and notice a naked man is standing in their bathroom. The stranger glares at Malcolm.
NAKED MAN (trembling): Do you know why you’re scared when you go online? I do. 
 MALCOLM (nervous): Do I know you? 
 NAKED MAN: Let’s all celebrate Dr. Malcolm Willis. Winner of the Webby Award. Dr. Malcolm Willis, his therapy site has helped so many. And he doesn’t even remember my name?
Malcolm’s eyes race for answers.
NAKED MAN: Last year? At ShrinksOnCall.com? The “Hallucination Station” message boards? You said you didn’t need to see me, that you could analyze me online. You were wrong.
 MALCOLM (visibly shaken): You’re… benniel@cs.com? wanda67@earthlink.net?
 NAKED MAN: Some people call me Freak.
 MALCOLM: Freak… oh God… freakmeister96@aol.com? I do remember you freakmeister. You said you could see dead retail bookshops; shops that couldn’t compete with the Internet. You were an intelligent kid. A fast typer.
 FREAKMEISTER: You forgot cursed. (begins to cry). You failed me.
 MALCOLM: I’m sorry I didn’t help you. I can try to help you now…
Freakmeister reaches for something out of view. He turns, raises a floppy disk, points it at Malcolm.
FREAKMEISTER: This is my Instant Messenger buddy list! I’m telling everyone I know you’re a fraud!
Freakmeister throws the disk at Malcolm, who collapses on the bed. His wife, Anna, screams.
Act I, Scene II
Two Months Later. Inside his house, Malcolm stands outside the door to his basement office. The door is locked. Then, without explanation because it would give away too much, Malcolm is in the basement office. Two windows are open on his computer. One is a ShinksOnCall chat session screen. The chat room is empty. The other is a Word document that reads: “cole08@pacbell.net. Acute anxiety. Socially isolated. Possible mood disorder.”
MALCOLM (muttering): Sounds like everybody on the Web.
Cole08@pacbell.net logs on to the chat room and begins to type Ego… nolo… Malcolm logs on too. Cole08 sees the other name pop up on his screen.
COLE08: Ah! I’m frightened!
 DRMALCOLM: It’s okay, cole08. I’m Dr. Malcolm. I was supposed to meet with you here. What is it you were typing?
 COLE08: Ego nolo online esse. Web est fabula. It’s Latin.
 DRMALCOLM: I’m looking impressed, but I’ll say nothing.
 COLE08: You’re a doctor? What kind?
 DRMALCOLM: A psychologist. I work with young people who might be afraid.
 COLE08: I am skeptically brushing my mousy brown hair off my too-large glasses. Are you a good doctor?
 DRMALCOLM: My site won a Webby award once. It’s been slow lately. You’re my first unique visitor in a while.
 COLE08: I have a secret to tell you, but can we wait until Act II, Scene I?
 DRMALCOLM: If you want.
Act I, Scene III
Still in his office, Malcolm logs on to a Latin dictionary Web site. He looks up the words Ego nolo online esse. Web est fabula. One by one he writes down the meanings and stares at the final translation: “I don’t want to go online. The Web is over.”
 
Malcolm (whispering): The mass for the dead dot-com.
The words seem to hang in the air forever.
Act I, Scene IV
Interior of a cramped apartment. Cole’s mother walks into their computer room, which seems unnaturally chilly. She turns up the thermostat, then looks at the computer. All the applications are open. One by one, she closes them as Cole walks in.
MOM (trying not to appear nervous): Were you looking for something, honey?
 COLE: Myst.
Mother clicks on the Myst icon. The program launches.
MOM: It’s right here, baby.
 COLE: What were you thinking Momma? Bad thoughts about me?
 MOM: Look at my face. I was not thinking bad thoughts about you.
Suddenly, the mother looks back at the computer. All the applications are again open. She screams.
COLE: Now are you thinking bad thoughts about me?
 MOM: Big time.
Act I, Scene V
Interior of Cole’s apartment. He is on the computer, in the chat room on ShrinksOnCall.com. Malcolm is also logged on.
DRMALCOLM: You want to sit?
 COLE08: I am sitting.
 DRMALCOLM: How about we play a mind-reading game? I’ll read your mind. If I’m right, you type :). If I’m wrong, you type :(. If I’m wrong twice, you can log off. Deal?
 COLE08: I’m nodding yes, but too wary to type ‘Yes.’
 DRMALCOLM: OK, I’m pressing  my fingers to my temples and my eyes are shut, just like a mind reader. Now…
 COLE08: How can you type with your fingers on your temples and your eyes shut?
 DRMALCOLM: Wow, you are scaring me with your prescience, but I am smiling benignly. OK, now, just before your mom and dad divorced, she went to a shrink like me and it didn’t help her. And so you think I’m not going to help you.
 COLE08: 🙂
 DRMALCOLM: You have a secret.  But you don’t  want to tell me.
 COLE08: 🙂
 DRMALCOLM: You’re a good student in school, and never get in trouble.
 COLE08: 🙁 We were supposed to draw a picture in school. I drew a man whose Internet revenue model was fatally flawed. The company folded. Nobody liked my picture. Now I only draw happy Internet pictures. Lots of pretty bubbles.
 DRMALCOLM: Let’s pause here to build tension.
 COLE08: What am I thinking now?
 DRMALCOLM: I… I don’t know.
 COLE08: 🙁 I was thinking, you’re nice. But you can’t help me until Act II Scene VI.
Act I, Scene VI
Dimly lit restaurant, evening. Malcolm rushes in to find Anna sitting alone at a table, finishing her meal.
MALCOLM: I’m sorry. I didn’t forget our anniversary. I just lost track of time.
Anna, very coldly, says nothing.
MALCOLM: I have this new client, Cole08. He’s like freakmeister96@aol.com. I think I can help this one.
Anna asks the waiter for the check.
MALCOLM: I know business has been bad for a while and you resent it. I know it’s put some distance between us.
Anna grabs check, signs it, leaves.
MALCOLM: That’s it, Anna. You keep this up and I’m checking out the porn sites!

Dot-Coms Sick of All the Survivor Analogies,admin,https://www.satirewire.com/dot-coms-sick-of-all-the-survivor-analogies/,"







San Francisco, Cal. (SatireWire.com) – Executives at nearly a dozen flailing Internet companies said today they were “sick and tired” of all the analogies to the CBS show Survivor, and just hope it all comes to an end now that the show is over. 
“It was real cute at first,” said Timothy Harrington, CEO of online sports retailer Fogdog. “You know, like the one about how the Internet, just like TV, went from Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? to Survivor. Ha ha. But the truth is, to equate some stupid television show to the misfortunes of real people and real businesses is insensitive and irresponsible.”
Asked if Fogdog planned to apply as a particpant in next season’s Survivor, Harrington became highly agitated, forcing a reporter to hastily exit Fogdog’s offices.

Palo Alto, Cal. (SatireWire.com) – The International Society of Computer Hackers blasted the media yesterday for continually using the word ‘virus’ when referring to the “Love Bug” email that recently infected computers. The program was more accurately a ‘worm,’ not a virus, said the hacker group, adding that “ignorant journalists” should check their facts. In response, the Society of Professional Journalists thanked the hackers, who it said will now be referred to by the more accurate term “slovenly misanthropic twits.”

"OY, YOU NEVER VISIT YOUR MOTHER'S WEB SITE",admin,https://www.satirewire.com/oy-you-never-visit-your-mothers-web-site/,"
 Not That You Should Care, Mr. I-Have-My-Own-Site-Now 
Miami, Fla. (SatireWire.com) — I’m thinking of divorcing your father. Oh, you didn’t know that, Mr. I-have-no-time-for-the-woman-who-bore-me-and-taught-me-HTML? Well, if you ever bothered to drop by your mother’s web site, just once in a while, spare just a few of your precious surfing minutes, you’d know that. It was in my blog from last week. 









But far be it from me to complain, although would it hurt so much to visit the family web site — the site where you first learned how to code, I shouldn’t have to mention? I’ve done some things around the place. Remember that animated .gif that your father used to love? The one with the stupid dancing fish? On the home page, he wanted it! He insisted! Well it’s gone! I’m doing everything in Macromedia Flash now. Your father doesn’t even know. G-d forbid he should make time to visit his own wife’s site. 
So I should be forgiving you? It’s in your genes, that’s what RabbiNet says. 
Your sister Rachel, she visits your mother’s site every week, and you know how hard it is for her to get around, what with that 56k dial-up connection she suffers with, and that schmendrick of a husband always hogging the computer. He surfs like a pig! But your sister Hannah — Judaism should have saints! She has a link to my site right on her home page, and she surfs in every day, after work. And she’s got kids! 
But you, you with your fancy DSL, you who won’t put up a link to your own mother’s site, you, who have by the way not brought me one grandchild — not that I’m utzing, G-d knows — you’re too busy chasing every girlie site with so much as a sheyner ponim. But I have news for you, Mr. I-can’t-be-bothered-to-visit-my-own-mother’s-site-but-I-can-troll-for-strumpets-at-Temptation-Island.com. That goyishe site has no pictures of the sort you’re after, not so much as a pupik showing. 
And don’t tell me you’re spending all your time at MinyanWorship.org. That site’s not doing so well, they can never get a quorum, no small thanks to you who never shows up for prayer, as G-d in himmel knows. 
Are you cleaning your mouse? Remember to clean your mouse. And keep your fingers on the keyboard, where they belong. Oy, how I suffer. 
You know, I haven’t changed your page since you left. It’s just like it was when we were still under one site, one happy family. Ouch, memories! But it’s still there, if you want to come back and see it, even maybe make a few changes. Nice to have it lived in once in a while. Not that I’m asking you to move back in. I know you have your own URL now and your own “site”, which I shouldn’t say, so I won’t, that it’s a mess Mr. Garbage Mouth and my friend Mrs. Meierson, who must have seen it G-d knows how, says don’t make yourself sick, that son of yours is just a nebbish, a nobody, look at the way he keeps that site of his with all the broken links and script errors. 










So I’m not saying you should consider coming back, but you still have the password to the site, if you remember how to use it, I’m not holding my breath. 
You remember Annabelle14@aol.com, the girl you met on MitzvahSingles.org? Such a lovely person. She still comes by my site. And so pretty! She sent me a .wav file and I put it up. You should come see it. How long will it be until somebody else, some nice rich mentsh who makes a good living and has a nice clean web page, is visiting my site and sees Annabelle and sweeps her off her feet? Not that you should care. But her video is there. And a link to her web site. And her email address, in case you’ve forgotten it. Not that you would think to care about such things as a dying mother’s last wish for your happiness. 
By the way, have I mentioned I’m dying? It was in my blog from last week. Oh, that’s right, you don’t have time to come to your mother’s site anymore. I’m leaving the site to your sisters.

SCIENTISTS TO STUDY GIANT ASTEROIDS BY STEERING THEM INTO EARTH,admin,https://www.satirewire.com/scientists-to-study-giant-asteroidsby-steering-them-into-earth/,"
 Are Major Asteroids As Dangerous As Predicted? The Answer Arrives in 2003 
London (SatireWire.com) — Disappointed after failing to take advantage of Earth’s relatively near miss with a large asteroid on Monday, scientists today excitedly unveiled what they called an “asteroid chute” that they said will direct the next massive space object directly into Earth’s path, where it can be studied more closely. 






POTENTIAL OUTCOMES







 “We don’t know what will happen,” said one NASA astrophysicist. “It’s all so very exciting.”




Scientists hope the redirected asteroid, now expected to strike Earth by June of 2003, will also settle a pair of long-running debates: Did an asteroid cause the extinction of the dinosaurs 65 million years ago? And what size must an asteroid be in order for it to render a planet uninhabitable? 
According to Michael Banio of Great Britain’s Royal Astronomical Society, asteroid “2001 YB5” passed within 375,000 miles of Earth on Monday, but it was still too far away for useful studies to be conducted. And because YB5 was not discovered until December, scientists did not have time to prepare for its arrival. However, using electron particle impulses emitted by a modified NASA satellite early this morning, British and American astrophysicists said they successfully nudged the next asteroid, a kilometer-wide giant they’ve labeled 2002 CUL8R, directly into Earth’s path. 
Asked what impact CUL8R will have, NASA astrophysicist Karen Lurg excitedly hesitated to speculate. 
“Well, we’re not sure, and that’s the beauty of it,” she said. “What we think will happen is, the ECO (Earth Crossing Object), which most likely has an iron/nickel core, will slam into Earth with the force of roughly 1 million nuclear bombs. But now we’ll be able to test that hypothesis.” 
“The 1 million nuclear bombs is an average postulation, by the way,” she added. “Some say 2 million. Others, believe it or not, say only 15,000. I think those folks are going to have egg on their faces when it’s all said and done.” 
The non-scientific community, however, failed to share Lurg’s interest. Moments after the announcement, the United Nations Security Council demanded that CUL8R be directed away from Earth immediately, and dozens of international leaders called the chute “catastrophically irresponsible” and “just bad science.” 
Scientists were quick to label the reaction “typical laymen’s myopia.” 
“Every 10 million years, an object at least 1km across smashes into Earth, so it’s inevitable that someday it’s going to happen,” said Banio. “By steering such objects toward us now and studying the results close up, we will be better prepared for that eventuality.” 
Meanwhile, Heinrich Voom, director of the Los Alamos National Laboratory, bristled at the charges of capriciousness. “Far from being irresponsible, we plan to strictly adhere to the Scientific Method; that is: Observe. Hypothesize. Predict. Test. Repeat until there are no discrepancies left,” he said. 
“It’s the ‘no discrepancies left’ part that bothers me,” countered U.S. Homeland Security Director Tom Ridge. 
Voom acknowledged that CUL8R may not settle every question. Three years ago, scientists at Los Alamos predicted an asteroid three miles across that strikes the mid-Atlantic Ocean would produce a tidal wave that would cover the East Coast of the United States to the Appalachian Mountains. It would also envelop the coasts of France and Portugal. Voom conceded CUL8R is not large enough to adequately test this model. However, he insisted, even a small tidal wave that only destroys Portugal would be useful in devising further experiments with the asteroid chute. 
Portuguese President Jorge Sampaio, however, said he would rather the model remain in the hypothetical stage. “I do not want to be a resolved discrepancy,” he said. 
Sampaio added that if the asteroid must come, he wished it would come now and “get it over with,” but Voom said the rock should not be rushed. 
“If we were to increase the asteroid’s speed, we would not have enough time to apply for several multi-million-dollar grants we’ll need to study its impact,” he explained. “That is what I would call bad science.”

SPAMTHRAX – CONTRACTING ANTHRAX VIA EMAIL,admin,https://www.satirewire.com/spamthrax-contracting-anthrax-via-email/,"
  Also Information on Net Evacuation, Bayer’s Production of e-Cipro 
Washington, D.C. (SatireWire.com) – The FBI today did not issue an alert for electronically disseminated anthrax, also known as “spamthrax,” because anthrax cannot be propagated through email. However, that will likely not stop panic-stricken thousands, who freaked after viewing the headline above, from warning friends and colleagues not to open email attachments.  








Fearing infection, many of these same people have already spread a rumor that the Internet has been evacuated. Others, meanwhile, shut down their computers before reading even this far, and as a result they will not see the following paragraphs explaining that there is no such thing as spamthrax. 
“Spamthrax? What the hell is spamthrax?” asked David Kalidis, spokesman for anti-virus software maker Symantec. “No, there is no such thing as spamthrax, so no, we will not be offering an update to address it. Who would fall for that, anyway?” 
Kalidis was reminded that hundreds of thousands of people clicked on attachments that actually contained the Anna Kournikova worm. 
“OK, who other than them?” Kaladis said. 
Meanwhile, Bayer spokeswoman Serena Farde confirmed the pharmaceutical giant was not working on e-Cipro, a binary form of the antibiotic Cipro, because there is no product called e-Cipro, and no need to produce one. However, thousands of computer owners who saw the reference to e-Cipro in the subheadline have already bombarded Bayer with requests for the digital drug. 
“I haven’t checked lately, but I’m not aware of any requests,” said Farde. “OK, I’ll look now, but this is sil… oh God, I’ve got 3,000 messages. Who are these people?” 
Farde was reminded that an asthmatic woman in California, fearing contamination, recently went to the emergency room. Her symptoms: shortness of breath. 
“I better call a press conference,” Farde sighed. 
The spamthrax contagion also did not spread to Washington, where FBI director Robert Mueller said no one at the agency’s National Infrastructure Protection Center was currently tracking down biocyberterrorists producing spamthrax because, he insisted, no such threat exists. “What is a biocyberterrorist?” Mueller asked. “I can’t believe anyone would be stupid enough to even threaten to send anthrax by email.” 
Mueller was reminded that:
 ¤ A Canadian woman, angry at a store cashier over the price of a purchase, recently claimed the credit card she had just handed over had anthrax on it.
 ¤ Also that two Mississippians told onlookers that flour used to outline a road race course were actually anthrax.
 ¤ Also that in 1998, a California man called police and claimed anthrax was in his building, apparently in an effort to get out of work early.
 ¤ Also that… 
“All right all right,” said Mueller. “I get the point.” 
Mueller added that he would squash the issue with a preemptive press release declaring that anthrax cannot be spread through email – a statement that will be picked up by the media and given a headline such as “FBI Downplays Spamthrax Threat: Emails Believed to Be Safe for Now.” As a result, see beginning of this story.

DOT-COM REFUGEES: LIFE IN CAMP ALPHA,admin,https://www.satirewire.com/dot-com-refugees-life-in-camp-alpha/,"
Hope Dwindles for Thousands; Kozmo.com Gang Doing OK 
Since the fall of Internet stocks began in April, former dot-com employees, forced from their jobs, have made their way to Dot-Camp Alpha, a makeshift settlement on a barren hillside in Silicon Valley. Despite its lack of even the most basic facilities — plumbing, air hockey, on-site masseuse — the camp has swelled to nearly 5,000 lost souls. SatireWire editor Treat Warland reports from the front.
NEAR EMERYVILLE, CALIF. (SatireWire.com) – Kara Deitzer stares, glassy-eyed, at the dusty road leading into Camp Alpha. It is literally choked with dot-com humanity, 200 more this day – refugees forced out in violent business model upheavals at CriticalPath and Tickets.com.









As they trudge into camp, their belongings barely contained in cardboard boxes, most of the refugees look confused and disoriented. Deitzer, who arrived here from Techies.com more than a month ago, knows how they feel.
“They’re thinking what I did when I showed up here,” she says. “It’s the same thought that we all have, every hour of every day: ‘I have no cubicle. I have no stock options. I am nothing.'”
And their spirits aren’t likely to improve. Though the United Nations has attempted to provide hope by granting the exiles official refugee status (see story), hope only truly comes once a day, when the Red Cross trucks pull in with relief supplies. This morning it was 30 dozen pair of roller blades. The blades were size 6, and all for the left foot, but they were snapped up in minutes by vicious mobs of dot-commers desperate for anything reminiscent of their previous lives.
And that exposes another truth here: despite the impressive pedigrees of the inhabitants, society quickly breaks down in the wild, and Dot Camp Alpha is now a vision of post-New Economy chaos, or perhaps modern-day Russia. One shining example: Internet company stocks are highly valued on the camp’s thriving black market, not for their monetary potential, but for their use in latrines.









While many faced atrocities before arriving – tales abound of close-knit teams at MaMaMedia being broken up, placed in separate SUVs, and driven off – life inside the camp provides new anxieties. The biggest fear is kidnapping. According to the refugees, high-tech recruiters sneak into the camp in the middle of the night, and the next morning, five or six programmers are missing. No one else. Just the programmers.
The tent-mates of the missing, however, aren’t talking and are likely being bribed into silence. One man from Mediconsult, who gave his name as Aziz, had shared a sleeping bag with a programmer until the night before. He insisted he saw nothing, yet his backpack, which had been empty, was suddenly stuffed to bursting with chocolates, cigarettes, and panty hose.
He tried to hide the stash, and for good reason. There are two dozen refugees here from delivery site Kozmo.com, who have a reputation for “acquiring” and delivering anything a refugee might ask for.
According to Ron Turner, a TalkCity exile who never shuts up, the Kozmosians split their allegiance and profits between two powerful factions. One is the Amazonians, who are feared, not because they are bigger or stronger. “There are only about 100 refs from Amazon.com,” Turner explains, “but we obey them because the consensus is that any day now, they’ll be getting major reinforcements, if you know what I mean.”
 
The other power brokers come from PlanetRX, who, with their drug connections, are able to sustain profit margins their former employer could only dream of. Efforts to speak to their leaders, however, were unsuccessful, as stern-faced former customer relations representatives, wielding Nerf Ball Blasters, would not let outsiders pass.
On the opposite end of the power scale are the untouchables. At 300-strong, the exiles from software maker Corel are the single largest group in camp, yet they are shunned by others because they are not considered pure-play refugees. But then, even Net blue-bloods can find themselves in the lower castes if they prove themselves unable to adapt.
The AltaVista refugees, for instance, are widely regarded as useless. “Just yesterday, we sent them out to search for sticks to make a fire,” says Turner. “And they came back with Thai sticks, Stickley furniture, old Styx albums, all kinds of shit. They still don’t get it.”
Back near the camp gate, Kara Deitzer wishes she didn’t “get it,” but she does, and good. Every day, she and the other ex-Techies.com crowd endure a stoning at the hands of other refugees. “It’s painful, but I understand it,” she says, “I came here from a career site for techies, so naturally people look to me for hope. But the very fact that I’m here depresses them.”
So why doesn’t she just leave? Her answer is the same as that given by most of the refugees.
“There are thousands of dot-commers here,” she says. “It’s an incredible networking opportunity.”

SETI PROJECT TURNS DOWN ALIEN HELP,admin,https://www.satirewire.com/seti-project-turns-down-alien-help/,"
Extraterrestrial Search “Going Just Fine” Without Extraterrestrial Interference 
Berkeley, Cal. (SatireWire.com) – Scientists for SETI@home, the worldwide project that uses millions of personal computers to aid in the search for extraterrestrial life, said today they have recently rejected several offers of technical assistance from aliens, arguing that bringing in outside help would be cheating. 




UNUSUAL SIGHT







“We told the Martians this week the same thing we told the Jovians (from Jupiter) last week and those whatever-they-weres from Antares last month: ‘Thanks but no thanks,'” said SETI@home technical director Dr. Karl Webber. “This is really an Earth-based project, so it wouldn’t be right to go off-world for help. And frankly, I think we’re perfectly capable of finding extraterrestrial life on our own.” 
Extraterrestrials from several planets, most recently Mars, have volunteered to join the SETI@home network, said Webber. The network, believed to be the largest distributed computing project in history, runs a screensaver program on personal computers that analyzes data from the Arecibo Radio Telescope in Puerto Rico. The data is then sent to SETI scientists to see if the telescope has detected signals that could indicate the existence of life elsewhere in the Universe. 
Since May of 1999, more than 3 million volunteers have downloaded the SETI@home screensaver, but the project has so fair failed to yield the proverbial Eureka. Webber insists, however, that the program is making real progress, which could be threatened by outside interference. 
“In building SETI@home, we have brought together peoples from disparate nations for a common purpose,” he said. “You start letting outsiders get involved, and you could destroy that sense of universal community we’ve achieved.” 
SETI@home chief physicist Dr. Quentin Leetes, meanwhile, conceded his opposition was more personal. The Antareans, for instance, offered assistance with new search parameters and invited scientists to an intergalactic scientific conference on Priasma BK VII, an M-Class planet in the Betelgeuse system. But Leetes said the aliens were both arrogant and pushy. 
“Honestly, the way they waltzed in here – or transported, really, but whatever – you’d think they were God’s gift to extraterrestrial exploration,” Leetes said. “And they start throwing out these crazy ideas, like we shouldn’t search for signals in the 1.4 GHz helium spectrum but should look in the hydrogen spectrum. We were like, ‘Yeah, right, what planet are you from?'” 
As for the Priasma VII conference, “That was mostly a scheduling conflict,” Leetes added. “There was a NASA conference in Vegas that same week that we’d already signed up for.”

“I don’t know about you, but my privates are worth a lot to me,” said Hanson. “I would never sell them at cost. That’s demeaning.”
Nearly as demeaning, said Hanson, were results at DirectHit, which invited him to “Join a club about ‘Bobby Hanson’s privates’ at thegloble.com.” When he learned that no such club existed, he was relieved, but also disappointed. “It’s like they build you up, right? (They) make you think you’re such a big deal that you’ve got a fan club, and then, poof! ‘Just kidding.'”









A similarly deflating tease appeared at Alta Vista, where one result from a major stock message board site read: “See what savvy investors think about ‘Bobby Hanson’s privates.’ Visit Raging Bull.” It turned out, however, that no one had thoughts on the subject.









Hanson said he doesn’t mind the keyword-driven ads in general; he conducted a few searches with other terms that turned out to be “pretty funny.” He does, however, wish sites would discontinue using his name, particularly Northern Light. At this search site, results are grouped into customized folders containing pages relevant to each query. After typing in “Bobby Hanson’s privates,” 14 folders appeared, including one labeled: “Jackson, Michael.”









“I almost threw up,” said Hanson.
Hanson stressed he hasn’t decided what type of action he will take against search engines and directories, but added a lawsuit was not out of the question. “I don’t know enough about this stuff, but all this talk about my privates can’t be legal,” said Hanson. “I’m only 15, for God’s sake. I haven’t even, you know, done it yet.”
Joey Pendleton, Hanson’s classmate and long-time friend, was equally outraged.
“What does he mean he hasn’t ‘done it’ yet?” said Pendleton. “He told me last week he’d done it with Maria Gonzalez twice, and she kept begging… man, I asked her OUT based on that information!”
Reached at her home, Maria Gonzalez was not amused: “Bobby said I did WHAT?”
“When I’m done with that boy, he won’t have any privates to sell on eBay!” added Maria’s father, Oscar Gonzalez.

Vandenberg Air Force Base, Calif. (SatireWire.com) – NASA today said it launched a $952 million satellite this morning “just for the hell of it.” 
“Oh, what the fuck,” said NASA Project Manager James Arnaut, recalling his final words before hitting the launch button.
The TRW-built satellite, carried on board a Delta II rocket, entered a sun-synchronous orbit 19 minutes later, “maybe, we’re not sure, and we don’t care,” Arnaut said.

"To Keep Reader Interest on Web, Sites Work Hard to Make Stories Brief and Make Headlines Snappy, Interesting, and Also Brief, If They Can Do That And Still Get Their Point Across",admin,https://www.satirewire.com/to-keep-reader-interest-on-web-sites-work-hard-to-make-stories-brief-and-make-headlines-snappy-interesting-and-also-brief-if-they-can-do-that-and-still-get-their-point-across/,"







New York, N.Y. (SatireWire.com) – Acknowledging that surfers on the World Wide Web are as short on time as they are on attention span, Internet sites are “working hard” at trying to keep both their headlines and the text of their site copy brief, concise, non-repetitive, and to the point, a move they hope will cause readers to look at more than just the headline, and also keep readers from giving up on a story or product description without ever making it to the second or third paragraph because the first paragraph was too long or convoluted, or failed to instill confidence in the reader that the rest of the story or description was worth reading, particularly if the first few sentences appeared to say it all or, worse, if they didn’t convince readers that the ensuing text would be able to add much to what they had already read in the first few sentences or paragraphs of the story or description they are reading. 
“On the Web, people don’t really have long attention spans, so you have to keep your sentences short and avoid being overly long, and the information you impart in those sentences, that should be very brief and concise and snappy, if you can pull that off without failing to explain what exactly the story or description is about or says,” explained site design expert Jakob Nielsen. “One way of doing that is to keep to a minimum quotes from people, be they other readers, customers, or so-called experts, that you can easily shorten or perhaps simply do without because what they are saying is repetitive or overly long or doesn’t really say anything that you haven’t already said before in your story or description.”

Washington, D.C. (SatireWire.com) – A  congressional report warning that U.S. air traffic control is vulnerable to computer attack proved true today, as hackers broke into several control center computers, wreaking havoc on the airline industry by causing planes to land safely and on time. 
“Our systems are not designed for this kind of reckless, irresponsible efficiency,” stressed Delta Airlines spokesman Dan Ryan who, like other airline executives, said he would go to Washington to meet with the FAA. “Until these individuals are stopped, we cannot guarantee… oh damn, my plane’s here already.

CUBISTS LAUNCH UNNAVIGABLE WEB SITE,admin,https://www.satirewire.com/cubists-launch-unnavigable-web-site/,"
Conceptual Realism Dominates Site No One Will Be Able to Use Anyway 
MADRID, SPAIN (SatireWire.com) – The International Society of Cubists officially launched its Web site today, a brilliant rejection of natural form and perspective that metaphysically establishes the implication of movement, analytically redefines spatial relationships, and is an absolute bitch to navigate. 
“What the hell is this? I can’t tell how to get anywhere,” one of the site’s first visitors told the Cubist Society’s Webmaster-Curator, Paulo Cassat. “Is this art, or is this a Web site?” 
“Thank you,” Cassat responded. 







Click image for full view




According to Society President Francisco Bernioz, the group launched the site to bring attention to Cubism, which was founded in the early 20th Century by Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque. The Society also hopes to establish a scholarship fund for young cubist painters and sculptors. However, at a public showing of the site here in Spain’s capital, most initial visitors were clearly uncomfortable with the design, especially the artists the site intends to help. 
“This site is going to turn people off,” complained one young sculptor. “I mean, how do I get from the home page to, say, the fundraising form?” 
“You must be willing to abandon your pre-conceived notions of traditional Web design,” replied Bernioz, “and disregard its nefarious standards of foreshortening, modeling, and chiaroscuro (the distribution of light and shade).” 
“Uh-huh. But how do I find the link?” the young man persisted. 
“You must embrace the idea that the link exists,” said Bernioz, “for once that idea is established, form itself can be forgotten.” 
“You don’t know where it is, do you?” 
“Not specifically, no,” Bernioz conceded. “It’s there somewhere. I think on a nonsequential parallel plane right behind the polygonal search box.” 
The site – digital graphics, text, and HTML on browser – has fared no better with art critics, who immediately accused the cubists of stealing the absurd navigation and layout from MSNBC.com. 
Editor’s Note: Due to popular inquiry, we are forced to make the following statement: there is no cubist Web site. It is a fictional site review by a real person. For real site reviews by a fictional person, please see Mr. Clickwell.

"AMAZING NEW ""SEGWAY HUMAN TRANSPORTER"" APPARENTLY NOT TESTED FOR ACRONYM",admin,https://www.satirewire.com/amazing-new-segway-human-transporter-apparently-not-tested-for-acronym/,"
( If You’d Prefer a Less Subtle Version of This Story, Click Here) 
Honestly, We’re Not Making This SHT Up
Manchester, N.H (SatireWire.com) – After a year-long buildup during which it was known as the mysterious “Ginger” or “IT,” the revolutionary, scooter-like “Segway Human Transporter” was unveiled Monday without first being checked for its potential acronym.









As a result, the media was full of Segway Human Transporter stories, while investors on Wall Street were hoping inventor Dean Kamen would take his cool Segway Human Transporter public so they could get a piece of Segway Human Transporter.
Word about the electric-powered transportation machine was leaked last year, but it took more than 10 years for Kamen and his team to get their Segway Human Transporter together. When the device was introduced Monday on ABC’s Good Morning America, riders who took an initial Segway Human Transporter spin were visibly impressed.
“I can’t believe this Segway Human Transporter!” said ABC’s Diane Sawyer. “It’s so fun and stable and quiet! Wow. Segway Human Transporter.”
“Boy, I hope no one’s looking because I really want to take a Segway Human Transporter right now!” joshed good-natured co-host Charles Gibson.
Gibson will have to wait, however. The company is currently producing only a big Segway Human Transporter for commercial use, and won’t make a little Segway Human Transporter for consumers until the 2002 holiday season, said Kamen.
At $3,000 each, however, the consumer model may be out of reach of all but the most generous of gift givers. “If it’s three grand, there’s no way I can give a Segway Human Transporter,” said Holly Dumal of Princeton, N.J. “I wish they’d make a cheap Segway Human Transporter.”
Kamen replied that the company would never give its Segway Human Transporter away, but promised a less expensive version was “definitely on our Segway Human Transporter list.”
Also in the works: a specially designed device for use by Pope John Paul that will speed the aging pontiff around the Vatican and St. Peters Square. It’s name: the Holy Segway Human Transporter.

PARENTS SAY WEB SITES TEACH FUCKING PROFANITY,admin,https://www.satirewire.com/parents-say-web-sites-teach-fucking-profanity/,"
Demand Laws Prohibiting Obscene Shit Their Kids Are Picking Up Online
Washington, D.C. (SatireWire.com) – A coalition of parenting groups today urged Congress to introduce a more stringent Communications Decency Act, arguing that profanity-filled Web sites are a bad influence on their children. “I used to think my kids got their potty-mouths from the shit they saw on TV and radio,” testified one frustrated parent. “But after surfing the Web, Jesus Fuckin’ Christ. That must be where they learn it.”









Speaking before a Senate panel, several dozen parents pleaded with lawmakers to revisit the Communications Decency Act, which was struck down by the Supreme Court in 1997 on First Amendment grounds.
“I believe the only way safeguard my children from the foul language they’re exposed to online is to pass a strong Internet Decency Act,” said Maria Zandavino, a mother of three from East Haven, Conn. “And don’t talk to me about filtering software. I use it and the little bastards must be getting around it ’cause they still swear like motherfuckin’ sailors.”
For parents like Rory Kennel of Kansas City, Mo., however, the issue goes beyond profanity.
“You’ve got sites out there that tell you to fuck authority and fuck your parents,” Kennel told the senators. “I don’t want my kids exposed to that disrespectful mentality, so I want you assholes to do something about it.”
Some parents contend that even minimal or indirect exposure to the Internet is dangerous. “I got a nine-year-old, in third grade, he can’t even fuckin’ read, okay?” said Philadelphia father of two, Anthony Miller. “But you know what? The kid swears out his ass all day long. It’s like, all these bad words, he absorbs them digitally or something.”
Emotional Testimony
While Constitutional scholars believe any act restricting language on the Internet would eventually be struck down by the courts, it was clear that senators were moved by the often emotional testimony. In one of the more stirring moments, Billy Cadwaller, a father of one from Macon, Ga., described how the Internet has soured his relationship with his 11-year-old daughter.
“One night I came home late and went in to give my little girl a kiss, and she wakes up all coughing and blinking and says to me, ‘Oooo Daddy, you are shit-faced again,'” Cadwaller testified. “Now where did she learn that? I’ll tell ya. I went to that Googly search engine and found 95 sites had the phrase ‘you are shit-faced’ on ’em. Ninety-fuckin’-five.”
“Fuck,” responded Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah.
But the day’s most poignant testimony came from Pamela Gottschalk, a single mother from Los Angeles who was able to draw a definitive connection between child behavior and the proliferation of obscene language on the Internet.
“How old’s the Web anyway? Maybe eight years or something?” Gottschalk said to the panel. “Well, my boy Joey is eight years old, and he’s a foul-mouthed dumb-ass little loser just like his father. Now you tell me there’s not a relationship there.”

RIOT ERUPTS AT DOT-COM REFUGEE CAMP,admin,https://www.satirewire.com/riot-erupts-at-dot-com-refugee-camp/,"
Visit from Il Papa Soldi, John Doerr, Sparks Violent Outburst
NEAR EMERYVILLE, CAL. (SatireWire.com) – Overcrowded conditions and a contentious visit from famed venture capitalist John Doerr sparked a riot yesterday at Dot-Camp Alpha, a refugee camp that now serves as home for nearly 18,000 laid-off dot-com workers. The violence, primarily between rival B2B and B2C factions, left 14 dead, scores injured, and hundreds of startup business plans discredited.









According to a spokesman for the International Red Cross, trouble began shortly after Doerr arrived in camp in his bullet-proof limousine, often referred to as the Hopemobile. Almost immediately, the partner in VC firm Kleiner Perkins was showered with startup proposals formulated by the refugees during their many months spent on this desolate Silicon Valley hillside.
However, officials estimate only 35 percent of camp residents still believe in venture capitalist doctrine. Most now dismiss venture capital and its teachings, and blame Doerr and his colleagues for overvaluing Internet companies, and urging them to go public prematurely. A clash, Red Cross officials said, was inevitable.
Tempers flared and fists flew as the man commonly known as Il Papa Soldi, or “The Money Pope,” made his way through the crowd of dot-commers laid off from the likes of Webvan, MyPoints, and Stamps.com. One disgruntled camper, who could not yell loud enough to be heard, used the speakers from his laptop and voice recognition software to send a strong, clear message to Doerr: “You are not well. Comb hair!”
The situation deteriorated during evening mass, when Doerr urged the refugees not to give up hope, and promised he would look at all the business proposals in due time, “except the B2C models. They are unto me like the dead.”
In response, several former employees from Doerr-backed WebMD and Drugstore.com shouted him down. “Oh, now you tell us!” one man yelled. “Why didn’t you tell me that before I quit my job at Merck? You bast…”
The man was quickly beaten to death by a quorum of B2B enthusiasts, who feared angering Doerr would cause him to leave camp before he got a look at the group’s proposal for an online call center to handle repair requests from Internet-enabled appliances.
The day’s bloodiest – and most deeply moving – moment came when Doerr allowed a lone refugee to approach him with her business plan. The woman, identified as 27-year-old Jonna Komay, a former Web developer with Razorfish, shook noticeably as she genuflected and handed over the document. “It’s a strategic solutions provider focused on corporate intranet broadband channel redistribution,” she whispered, her eyes cast downward. “Oh, and if you would, please sign the six-page NDA (non-disclosure agreement). Here’s a pen.”
Despite her tremulous voice, several B2C veterans in the crowd overheard, and scoffed. “Yeah, right! What the hell is ‘corporate intranet broadband channel redistribution?’ That doesn’t mean anything! Let’s sell CDs and pants!”
Doerr, however, shocked onlookers by addressing the woman. “Can you benchmark your cost centers?” he said.
“Oh yes,” Komay replied. “Vertically-integrated metrics. Totally component-based.”
Silence enveloped the camp as Doerr raised his hand and blessed the plan on the spot. After an eerie pause, the crowd surged forward, trampling Komay and screaming “I’m her partner!” “No, I’m her partner!”
Ten people, including Komay, died in the stampede. Several reporters formerly with Red Herring and FoxNews.com quickly typed up dispatches about the incident and pretended someone would publish them.

DELL SUPPORTS EXTENDING GATEWAY AMNESTY,admin,https://www.satirewire.com/dell-supports-extending-gateway-amnesty/,"
Gateway Denies Amnesty Exists; Dell Says Just Trying to Help 
Round Rock, Texas (SatireWire.com) – Dell Computer today said it supports extending the amnesty period for anyone possessing a Gateway computer, arguing Gateway owners should be given “at least” two more weeks to hand over their equipment to police without fear of arrest and conviction.









An outraged Gateway CEO Ted Waitt, however, denied an amnesty program exists, and accused its rival of fabricating the story to scare people into dropping Gateway and buying Dell products. In response, Dell CEO Michael Dell called Gateway’s allegation “truly worrisome.”
“If Gateway is correct and there is no amnesty program, that would mean the police can arrest anyone using Gateway products right now,” said Dell. “Honestly, they should be warning their customers about this.”
But Waitt insisted that is not what he meant. “There is no amnesty program because it is not illegal to own a Gateway computer, so there is no reason to have an amnesty,” he said. “Why on Earth would it be illegal to own a Gateway?”
Dell said he wondered about that too. “I’m not a lawyer, so it would be improper for me to comment on the specific reasons why thousands of Gateway owners have been imprisoned and had their houses and families taken from them. I just heard it’s been happening.”
“That is absolutely ludicrous!” said an enraged Waitt.
“I totally agree,” said Dell. “That’s why we believe the amnesty should be extended, so that this doesn’t keep happening. I mean, I know Gateway is having revenue problems, but you’d think they’d at least want to keep their customers out of prison.”
“Some things are just more important than profits,” Dell added. “At least that’s how we see it.”
A spokesman for San Diego-based Gateway later said the company would file a complaint with the California attorney general’s office, accusing its rival of unscrupulous business practices. Dell, however, said no filing is necessary.
“Look, we’re out there supporting a fellow computer maker in its hour of need, but if Gateway doesn’t want our help, then we’ll stay out of it,” said Dell. “We’re going to be busy helping IBM with their exploding ThinkPads anyway.”

MAJOR SITES HAWKING MINOR'S PRIVATES?,admin,https://www.satirewire.com/major-sites-hawking-minors-privates/,"
Amazon, eBay, Raging Bull Advertising Boy’s ‘Male Equipment’
TERRELL, TEXAS (SatireWire.com) – What began as an insecure boy’s search for self-esteem ended in shock and embarrassment for a 15-year-old Texas youth who discovered last week that Internet retailers such as eBay and Amazon claimed to have information on – and in some cases were offering to buy and sell – his privates.
According to Bobby Hanson, a high school sophomore in this Dallas suburb, last Tuesday he was searching the Net, “trying to provide some centering for my male self-esteem,” and decided to search for “Bobby Hanson’s privates” at directory site LookSmart. The hunt quickly turned humiliating. While all the supposed Web page matches for “Bobby Hanson’s privates” turned out to be irrelevant, sponsors on the site actually had much to say on the subject.
 (Ed. Note: the following screen images are NOT fictional; they are real. Sites actually do this. Try it yourself.):









“I couldn’t believe it,” said Hanson. “People had written books about my privates? EBay was willing to auction my privates? How come not one of them asked my permission first?”
According to search firm executives, there is a simple reason. Many search portals and directories have advertising agreements with other sites, including retailers. When a searcher inputs a term, those keywords are automatically inserted into sponsor ads that appear with search results. As a result, said a LookSmart spokesperson, “I can assure Mr. Hanson that his genitals are not being auctioned at eBay. The only reason those references show up is because he specifically typed in ‘Bobby Hanson’s privates.'”
“And it’s a good thing I did,” Hanson responded. “Otherwise, how would I have known about this widespread abuse?
“If it’s true that my privates aren’t really for sale at eBay,” he continued, “then I don’t think they should advertise that they are. As for EXP.com, I’m sorry, but I’ve never met anyone there, so I don’t think they qualify as experts on my privates. I’m not even an expert on my privates.”
However, Bobby’s mother, Evelyn Hanson, questioned that claim. “Bobby spends an awfully long time in the bathroom,” she said, particularly after watching episodes of “Buffy the Vampire Slayer.”
While unnerved by his mother’s comments, Hanson said he would save his venom for the likes of search site HotBot, where after typing in ‘Bobby Hanson’s Privates,’ he saw:

Seoul, South Korea (SatireWire.com) – Spurred by disturbing claims that  three women may already be pregnant with the first human clones, a group of Asian, African, and Hispanic scientists today declared that while genetic research may prove beneficial to mankind, the cloning of white people should be banned as redundant since “they all look alike already.” 
“I know they say there are differences, but really, if you’ve seen one white person, you’ve seen them all,” said South Korean geneticist Oh Woon Chun, who along with 600 other signatories said they would refuse to participate in any research that could lead to the cloning of white people. 
Added Nigerian fertility specialist Isaac Olisay: “We should be cloning people who are unique, people who see the world in different ways, not people who all act the same.” 
In response, outraged Caucasians across Europe, Australia, and North America said they intended to contact their attorneys. 
“See?” replied Olisay.

Intel Has Smaller Chips; AMD Has Smaller Employees,admin,https://www.satirewire.com/intel-has-smaller-chips-amd-has-smaller-employees/,"







Sunnyvale, Cal. (SatireWire.com) – In response to Intel’s statement that it will produce transistors only three atoms wide by 2005, rival chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices announced today that most of its employees are no more than 14 inches tall. 
AMD, however, refused to allow reporters into its facilities to verify the claim. “We would, but we can’t reach the doorknobs to let you in,” spokesman Ravi Chalani said in a phone interview.
AMD’s assertion comes a day after Intel boasted it will soon pack 400 million tiny transistors on a chip running at 10GHz. The Sunnyvale-based AMD has made no such chip claim, but insisted employee size directly relates to chip size. “It’s just common sense that smaller employees will eventually translate into ever smaller chips,” said Chalani, noting that smaller employees have smaller hands and are also naturally predisposed to “think small.” Meanwhile, AMD chief executive Jerry Sanders has been working with a miniaturization coach and can now only be found with an electron microscope, Chalani added.
Citing competitive concerns, an Intel spokesman refused to reveal the average height of its workers, but a former Intel executive, speaking on condition of anonymity, said most Intel employees were between 5’2″ and 6’4″.

COMPUTER VIRUS MAKING TO BE PROSECUTED AS HATE CRIME FOR TARGETING STUPID PEOPLE,admin,https://www.satirewire.com/computer-virus-making-to-be-prosecuted-as-hate-crime-for-targeting-stupid-people/,"
Systems Administrators Now On Front Lines of Bias Crime
Washington, D.C. (SatireWire.com) – With yet another email virus spreading across the globe, 41 U.S. states and six European countries today announced that the act of creating an attachment-based computer virus will now be considered a hate crime because it intentionally targets stupid people.







Hate crime victim Bob Fnork (center) is stunned to discover he has just opened another infected attachment.




“In a hate crime, the offender is motivated by the victim’s personal characteristics, and in the case of email viruses, the maker is clearly singling out those who open email attachments when they’ve been told a thousand times not to,” said California Attorney General Bill Lockyer. “Like any other segment of the population, people of stupidity need protection from bias.”
The decision, however, is already causing a firestorm of controversy. In the United States, the American Civil Liberties Union vehemently opposed the action, arguing it runs counter to the spirit of hate crime laws.
“Hate crime statutes are specifically designed to protect minority groups,” said ACLU President Nadine Strossen. “I’m not sure the number of stupid computer users meets that criterion.”
France, meanwhile, said it would not prosecute anyone willing to write a virus in French.
But in London, the British Civil Idiots Union applauded the move, arguing that virus-based hate crimes cause victims to suffer psychological harm. “Every time we pass on one of these emails, our self-esteem is shattered when we are forced to publicize our condition,” said CIU President Michael Overly. “It’s always a shock to my system every time I have to write, “Hey everybody, if you get an email attachment from me, don’t open it! I just found out my computer got infected by a virus! Sorry!”
In identifying virus-based hate crime activity, U.S. and European law enforcement authorities said they will focus on anyone creating a virus delivered via email attachment that contains either no subject line or a vague subject line such as “Hey, check this out!” “I saw this and thought of you!” or “I am wanting to get your opinion on this.”
Congressional leaders also said they will amend the 1990 Hate Crimes Statistics Act and require the FBI to track data on crimes based on race, religion, sexual orientation, ethnicity, or stupidity. As a result, some experts expect the annual number of hate crimes in the U.S. alone to jump from 6,500 to 132 million.
Others believe the actual number will be higher, but say many crimes will go unreported because the victim refuses to recognize what has happened. Dallas, Texas resident Mike Smith is a case in point.
“I am not a victim of a hate crime because I am not stupid,” said Smith. “I got an email with an attachment from my buddy in Phoenix, so naturally, I opened it. What’s so stupid about that?”
What, Smith was asked, did the email say?
“It said, ‘I_love_you.’ Why?”
In Moline, Ill., police have already made their first arrest under the expanded laws. Matthew Spere, a 17-year-old high school senior, was taken into custody this morning after police said he had created and propagated a variant of the “Goner” virus. In a phone interview, Spere denied the charges. “My virus wasn’t targeting stupid computer users specifically, just anyone using Microsoft’s Outlook Express or AOL,” he said. “Oh… damn.”

2000 THE INTERNET YEAR IN REVIEW: Oct-Dec,admin,https://www.satirewire.com/2000-the-internet-year-in-review-oct-dec/,"
OCTOBER
 
¤ Vice President Al Gore puts the Internet up for sale on auction site eBay, explaining that while he will miss his creation, he needs money to duel Republican presidential contender George W. Bush in the stretch run to November. 
¤ America Online announces that new members will get free Internet access for the rest of the year during the first month. 
¤ In submitting its proposed schedule for the appeals court trial, Microsoft denies it is stalling, arguing there is nothing unusual about its 300-page brief, which is written in Olde Norse. 
¤ Just days after pop diva Madonna won a battle to wrest control of Madonna.com by arguing she was the world’s best known Madonna, Attorney General Janet Reno employs a similar argument to win the rights to VirginMary.com. Several alleged virgins, many named Mary, attempt to win the domain, but Judge Harvey Winston decides to award the domain to the Attorney General without testing her, and despite her non-Mary status. “Is Janet Reno named Mary? No,” writes Judge Winston. “Is Janet Reno a virgin? That, frankly, is a question this court is not willing to contemplate.” 
¤ Microsoft executives continue to insist that whoever hacked into their computer system did not gain access to the source codes of its major products. However, Redmond officials concede they may never learn the identity of the culprit or culprits. In an unrelated note, Sun Microsystems surprises industry observers by releasing Sun Office, Sun NT, and Sun 2000. 
NOVEMBER 
¤ Hewlett Packard, the nation’s No. 2 computer and office equipment maker, discloses it doesn’t have anywhere to go for Thanksgiving and is “putting out feelers.” Interested parties should expect 83,200 for dinner. Yorkshire pudding: 43,500. Just cornbread: 39,700. 
¤ A computer virus labeled “CokeSpill,” which mimics the spill of a Coca-Cola on a keyboard, infects computers at Innnntel, Suuuuun Microooosystems and DDDDellll, says a spokesman for Syyyyyymmmmmantec, whose network is also infected. 
¤ As part of its staff cuts, online auction site eBay says it will auction its employees off individually. To increase interest, eBay pairs each outgoing staffer with a fine collectible. On day one, bidding on human-resources-manager- Claudia-Penton-with-a-set-of-Mr.-Peanut- snack-cups is slow, but the action on marketing-director-Randy-Keller-with- a-hand-painted-Limoges-sardine-server is quite hectic. Explains Keller: “I think it’s obvious why my bids are moving. I have six years experience in product positioning and demand planning, and come with a matching server tray.” 
¤ Priceline announces that the press release it posted a year ago claiming the company would break even in 2001 was missing a comma. The actual phrase should have been “the company will break, even in 2001.” 
¤ After years of anticipation and with great fanfare, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers unveils seven new and badly needed top level domains to join .com, .org, and .net. Among the seven are .coop, .museum, and .aero. Honestly. 









DECEMBER 
¤ The world’s 14 remaining users of the Netscape browser exult over the release of Netscape 6, the first new version of the browser in two years, and a product Netscape executives predict will blow away Microsoft’s Internet Explorer “if this were 1997.” To solidify its market position, Netscape senior vice president Jim Martin announces a “major” partnership with Apple Computer to have Netscape 6 installed on all new Apple machines, a move that Martin boasts will really break Microsoft’s stranglehold on the browser market, “if this were, say, 1984.” 
¤ In response to Intel’s statement that it will produce transistors only three atoms wide by 2005, rival chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices announces that most of its employees are no more than 14 inches tall. AMD, however, refuses to allow reporters into its facilities to verify the claim. “We would, but we can’t reach the doorknobs to let you in,” spokesman Ravi Chalani says in a phone interview. 
¤ The clichÃ©s about how the Internet has brought people together and made the world smaller turn out to be true, as Swedish researchers report that Earth is now just 19 miles across, and that its 6 billion inhabitants are stacked 842-high on a piece of land the size Bimini. 
¤ Linux continues to make inroads in the operating system market by winning support from companies such as IBM and Dell. Microsoft appeals. 
¤ With CMGI at $6, Priceline at $1.50, InfoSpace at $7 and Fogdog at 66 cents, Internet investors issue a “strong hit” on analysts Tim Fogarty, John Ryding, Ullas Naik, Laura Pavlenko, Henry Blodget, and Larry Rice. 
¤ America Online announces that new members will get free Internet access for life during the first month.

SOMALIS LIVE IN FEAR OF LOOMING INTERNET BUBBLE,admin,https://www.satirewire.com/somalis-live-in-fear-of-looming-internet-bubble/,"
Rival Tribe Leaders Claim They Can Stop Giant Bubble from Devestation
MOGADISHU, SOMALIA (SatireWire.com) – Red Cross officials in Somalia, which in September became the last African nation to go online, appealed for calm today as the country anxiously awaits the Great Internet Bubble, which many fear will wreak havoc on their villages, livestock, and loved ones.
“It is said that once you are on this Internet, it is inevitable that the Great Bubble will come for you,” bemoaned Issaq tribesman Siad Barre, who stood guard outside his home with a rusted AK-47. “I have heard it appears like a thief in the night and will steal our goats and children.”









“No no, the Great Bubble is made of sand,” said Barre’s neighbor, Farah Abgaal. “It rides the wind and will swallow us whole. That gun is no use, Siad. You are a fool.”
Both Abgaal and Barre dismissed as “Western lies” the Red Cross’ explanation that the so-called Internet Bubble is not some kind of animal or phantom, but an economic term to describe a period of intense speculation. Instead, they heed the counsel of clan leaders who warn that the Great Bubble has devoured America and much of Europe, and will soon come for them.
In a speech in downtown Mogadishu last night, Gen. Gidir Muhammed warned people to be on the lookout for “mighty portents and omens” that will precede the Bubble’s arrival. “First we will behold the Vile Infusion of the Venture Capitalists, who will offer us riches in return for our enslavement,” said Muhammed. “Then will come the evil Dotcoms, who will take over our coffee houses and seduce us with jobs of great promise.”
Muhammed predicted that he alone could stop the Bubble, but only if rival clans rallied around him and killed his enemies.
In response to the speech, roving thugs immediately executed 145 businessmen. “They were agents of the Great Bubble,” one soldier explained. “It has the fangs of a boar and arrives in a Hummer.”
Asked if he actually believed that, the soldier became quiet for a moment, then whispered, “Not really. We just talk like this to get on CNN. How’d Intel do today? My E*Trade account is down again.”
Added Siad Barre, still holding his AK-47: “We will see who is the fool, Farrah Abgaal, when the Bubble makes kishwari with your wife!”

Nuke Waste Repository Could Turn Moon Into Wasteland,admin,https://www.satirewire.com/nuke-waste-repository-could-turn-moon-into-wasteland/,"
Reno, Nev. (SatireWire.com) – President Bush blasted a plan unveiled Thursday that calls for depositing nuclear waste on the Moon, arguing the radioactive material could turn the lunar surface into a vast, uninhabitable wasteland. 
“Imagine a place where nothing would grow, where naturally occurring life would be nonexistent, where humans would only be able to survive by wearing special suits and breathing through air tanks,” said Bush, who favors Yucca Mountain, Nev., as a national waste repository. 
“If this idea of burying nuclear waste on the Moon comes to pass, then what you’d be left with up there is nothing but a great big lifeless hunk of rock.” 
The lunar idea, proposed by Sherwin Gormly, an environmental engineer for Reno, Nev.-based Tetra Tech EM Inc., would carry waste to the Moon on missiles that, if they escaped Earth intact, would theoretically drive into the lunar surface and bury the cargo. Because the Moon has no hydrosphere, Gormly insisted the problem of waste migration – the contamination of groundwater – would be eliminated. Bush, however, reasoned that the absence of water would only make detection more difficult. 
“In Nevada, we’ll know if the water’s contaminated ’cause it will show up in tests,” he said. “But on the Moon, we can’t test it. So we’ll never really know for sure.”

Israel Offers Palestinians Virtual State For Only $49.95 a Month,admin,https://www.satirewire.com/israel-offers-palestinians-virtual-state-for-only-49-95-a-month/,"
Jerusalem (SatireWire.com) – Proposing a compromise he hopes will ensure his nation’s security, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak announced Israel will allow the Palestinians to form an independent nation, but only on the Internet. 
The offer calls for the Palestinians to take up residence on a shared Israeli Web server, but otherwise allows them to “control their own destiny,” insisted Barak, who added the Palestinians would be responsible for their own virtual police, education, and technical support. The Palestinians would pay Israel $49.95 a month to host the space, or $69.95 for the special “Deluxe Virtual Nation Package,” which includes Microsoft’s Site Server Commerce Edition 3.0. 
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, who is on record demanding that a separate Palestine be carved out of the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and eastern Jerusalem, quickly attacked the proposal. “We have ‘shared’ our space with Israel long enough,” Arafat said in a statement. “I will not sit down with Mr. Barak’s government unless they guarantee us a fully-dedicated, independent server. And they must waive the $25 set-up fee.”

Report That Pessimists Die Sooner – No Big Surprise to Pessimists,admin,https://www.satirewire.com/report-that-pessimists-die-sooner-no-big-surprise-to-pessimists/,"
New York (SatireWire.com) – A study issued Tuesday claiming that pessimists have more long-term health problems than positive people just proves pessimists were right, say pessimists.

The research, conducted by the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., found that less positive people suffer significantly higher rates of illness, and advised physicians to encourage their patients to adopt a more positive outlook to improve and lengthen their lives. Pessimists across the country said they would try, though they seriously doubted it would work.
“OK, here’s a positive thought,” said Chicago resident Eric Weinstadt. “Why not save me the trouble I’m going to have later and just shoot me now?”
“No wait, save the bullet,” he added. “I’m going out to a party with my so-called friends tonight. I’ll bet I die of boredom.”
