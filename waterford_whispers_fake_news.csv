ESB Lad Cleaning Up On Cash Payments For Connecting Homes,Colm Williamson,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2023/10/04/esb-lad-cleaning-up-on-cash-payments-for-connecting-homes/," LOCAL ESB employee Jimmy Tobin is making an absolute killing on cash payments made by builders looking to hook up new homes with electricity in a timely manner. “It usually takes weeks to get a place connected but if ya put cash into my hand I’ll be out after work no problem,” Tobin explained, wondering now what to spend the cold hard cash on, “sure there’s loads of us at this craic for years – it’s the Irish way of getting things done”. It is estimated Tobin charges anywhere between 5 to 10 thousand euros for the practice, which is highly illegal but has been never properly investigated by the ESB or Gardaí, apart from one recent case in High Court. “The contracted Uisce Éireann lads are at it too, might as well make hay while the sun shines, as the fella says, wha’?” Tobin added, not a fucking bother on him at’all at’all, “I made nearly 40k hooking up a development last week, at this rate I’ll be able to afford to build my own housing estate in a few years and then rent it back to the council for an absolute fortune – ya gotta love this country, boy!”"

Mix Up: Aldi & Lidl Staff Spent Year Working In Rival Supermarkets Without Realising,Julius Hubris,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2023/09/21/mix-up-aldi-lidl-staff-spent-year-working-in-rival-supermarkets-without-realising/,"COMPETING routine HR reviews actioned by senior staff at both Lidl and Aldi revealed that a number of absent-minded staff accidentally worked a full year in the rival brand supermarket after straying onto the premises one day. “How did we not catch this sooner,” marveled a Lidl HR manager reviewing CCTV footage which showed one Aldi-clad worker put in a year’s worth of work in Lidl while going undiscovered. “Sure, the public sort of smash us together as interchangeable and one in the same but for our own employees to do it? Wow,” confirmed a joint statement for Aldi and Lidl. One Lidl employee who worked a year in Aldi by accident defended their blunder. “It’s not a stupid as it sounds, I was particularly tired one day and I must have walked into Aldi by mistake but c’mon the manager in Aldi was also called a stern woman called Magda and it’s not like there were loads of staff buzzing around, the shop floor is a ghost town,” explained Ciaran Tiernan.  At least 28 staff nationwide, from both retailers, made similar errors however disruption at affected branches remained minimal. “Their middle aisle also had a special offer a 4-in-1 toaster/vacuum/power washer/home gym combo that same week, I’m not taking the blame for this, they need to sort making sure their vibes aren’t so identical,” explained the Lidl and Aldi CEOs who unwittingly had switched places for the year as well."
TikTok Fined €300mn For Targeting Children When Still In The Womb,Julius Hubris,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2023/09/18/tiktok-fined-e300mn-for-targeting-children-when-still-in-the-womb/,"YET ANOTHER humongous fine has been levied on TikTok after the Irish Data Protection Commissioner found the app was targeting potential child users while they were still in the womb. Already fined for breaches related to the processing of children’s data, the most popular social media app amongst children under 13 is accused of further courting of that lucrative demographic. “The doctor was like, ‘oh lovely you’re having a boy’ and that’s when I saw the phone in my womb which was endlessly scrolling content clearly geared towards children who, according to regulations, are permitted on the app,” said soon-to-be mum Grace Leahy.  This news is set to dwarf the fines issued last week for a TikTok feature called ‘Family Pairing’ which meant a child’s account could be ‘paired’ with an unverified non-child user but TikTok did not verify whether this user was actually the child’s parent or guardian. “I was overjoyed to feel my child kick for the first time but then I realised they were clearly doing a TikTok dance trend,” shared upset Mum-in-waiting Sarah Cloffey. TikTok has denied all accusations it has targeted children in the womb but could provide no explanation for the increase in instances of a condition called ‘TikTok eyes’ whereby the children’s pupils were the pink and aqua orbs. “Sorry, so so sorry. The EU has been up our arse over this. Please, please, please, please keep all your lovely taxable revenue in Ireland please. Promise not to be mad when we fine you for illegal transfer of user data back to China either,” confirmed a DPC official in tough-talking exchanges with TikTok."
WWN Reviews Sean Quinn’s New Book,Julius Hubris,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2023/09/15/wwn-reviews-sean-quinns-new-book/,"WWN’s literary editor Peter Percival Penrose reviews Sean Quinn’s new book ‘In My Own Words’ which sets a new benchmark for getting paid to write any old shite.  “Freddie Mercury was the master of the pop vocal range, Laurence Olivier the undisputed master of the craft of act and Sean Quinn is the preeminent talent in the field of self-pity. He is to honesty what Dave from Portmarnock is to expertise in cosmic events and meteorite identification. The phrase ‘and obviously I had no idea about all that business’ frequently closes out passages in which Sean Quinn distances himself from various crimes. Doing so little reflecting he might as well be a mirror with all the glass taken out. There are certainly words, and many of them come together in a specific order to form sentences but that doesn’t make it readable. In order to read the book you need a reading age ‘toddler who is incapable of telling the truth about who spilled the milk on the kitchen floor’. The free Stanley blade given away with each book can be deemed in poor taste. Over the book’s 242 pages the phrase ‘needless to say I had the last laugh’ appears 647 times, however it also include as asterisk which is followed by the words ‘he did not in fact have the last laugh’. The opening pages include instructions to former Quinn employees to purchase 20 copies of the book each or else. Sadly I was unable to read the last chapter as by the time I got to it Sean Quinn had already lobbied Google under ‘right to forget’ laws to remove it."
BREAKING: Pub Has Only One Decent Shitter,Colm Williamson,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2023/09/14/breaking-pub-has-only-one-decent-shitter/," PANIC has set in for local man Daniel Ryan today as WWN can exclusively reveal the pub he’s currently sitting in has only one decent shitter which is usually occupied by people not taking a dump. The IBS sufferer known for his sudden treks to the nearest bog tried hard not to overthink the fact Brady’s Inn has now joined the majority of Irish pubs in having only one decent shitter for men. A shitter that he will be forced to wait in line on as complete bastards who piss all over the toilet seat because they’re too bladder shy to relieve themselves at the urinal and coke heads now hog the only available shit bucket within 500 meters. “Bad idea having that Indian before heading out tonight,” Ryan told himself, before praying he wouldn’t be caught short again this week, “women have no idea how lucky they have it with all their private shite boxes, if it comes down to it I’ll just have to whip me jocks down, aim me hole at the urinal and hope for the best”. As stipulated in the Irish constitution, all Irish bars must adhere to a one shitter rule for men’s toilets, a draconian law presumably invented to prevent fornication between men in the jacks."
Banks Warn Of New ‘We Replaced Staff With Chat Bots & Now Hackers Are Taking Advantage’ Scam,Colm Williamson,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2023/09/14/banks-warn-of-new-we-replaced-staff-with-chat-bots-now-hackers-are-taking-advantage-scam/," BANKS responsible for drastically cutting staffing numbers and turning branches into cold, faceless bank shelters dependent on poor automated teller machines and chat bots have warned customers that scammers are now taking advantage of this fact, WWN reports. “Who’d have thought replacing puny humans with mediocre technology to look after the world’s most important commodity would result in said commodity becoming compromised by scam artists,” a computerised AI-run spokes banking machine stated today on a printed out receipt, “it seems you humans may have some use after all and could possibly be more adept at deciphering what’s real and not real than us machines”. A scam alert issued by Irish bank BOI today warned about a new ‘live chat’ scam in which fraudsters are duping customers into allowing remote access to their computers and bank accounts, with this being the latest in a litany of technology-based banking scams costing the industry billions in security fees every year. “The cost is worth it just to not deal with you people face to face,” a real spokesperson from the banking industry explained today, “we hate you and despise ever having to interact with customers so we’re going to continue down this path of a cashless regime that will force everyone to trust that our computer servers are a safe place to store all of their wealth on – what could possibly go wrong?”"
Musk Now Has Enough Children To Begin Replacing All His Major Organs,Julius Hubris,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2023/09/13/musk-now-has-enough-children-to-begin-replacing-all-his-major-organs/,"WITH THE ANNOUNCEMENT of a third child sired with singer Grimes, last place in the Hank Scorpio lookalike competition Elon Musk officially has enough offspring to begin replacing his vital organs.  “This is the guy who has killed a bunch of monkeys by trying to put brain chips in their heads, I think he can be trusted to act ethically when choosing which child has the healthiest kidney for him to take,” said one insider, as Musk explores ways to live longer as all narcissistic billionaires must. Known for choosing zany names for some of his future organ donors, the full name of Musk’s third child with Grimes continues that trend with the name Take Lungs In Case Of Emergency. “Billionaires replacing their blood supply with that of their son is so last week, Elon is always ahead of the curve. If Elon’s brain ever needs replacing the plan is to mush all 10 children’s brains together to form a megabrain,” confirmed Musk’s private surgeon. “It keeps him up at night, the fact that the one transplant that still eludes him … the personality transplant.” Musk has spoken on record about how he feels intelligent people need to procreate to preserve the future of humanity itself. “Yeah I agree with the genius best known for cars going on fire, offering a masseuse a horse in exchange for sex and amassing billions in debt from overpaying for a loss making social media company, smart people like him should have more kids,” shared one expert."
BP CEO Resigns After Failing To Hit Q3 ‘Destroy The Planet’ Targets,Julius Hubris,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2023/09/13/bp-ceo-resigns-after-failing-to-hit-q3-destroy-the-planet-targets/,"CONTRARY to reports that BP CEO Bernard Looney resigned from his position after misleading the board over personal relationships with colleagues, the executive was in fact pushed due to missing key ‘destroying the planet with fossil fuels’ targets. “We just said it straight out to Bernard, where’s our motherfucking oil spills? The guy hadn’t even looked at the oil spill targets for Q3! He only half-heartedly used the war in Ukraine as an excuse to jack up oil prices too,” shared one board member, made entirely of blood-soaked money. Conscious of how negatively the share price could be impacted if the market got wind of the fact BP had failed to ramp up the evisceration of protected habitats and ecosystems worldwide, the board felt it had no choice but to act. “The Ohio refinery fire which killed two people was way back in 2022! We can’t keep living in the past, sure the Deepwater Horizon oil spill was great but do we want this planet plunged into irreversible climate breakdown tomorrow or are we lazily going to hit that target in the 2030s?” added another board member, who also sits on the board of a charity so it cancels out being a cheerleader for fossil fuel destruction. “And sure, we prioritise money over humans rights by fighting all communities who at are greater risk of leukemia as a result of living near our oil sites but Bernard was paid £10mn a year plus bonuses to kill the planet not save it and it wasn’t happening fast enough”. Favourites to succeed Looney as BP CEO, who are deemed to have the correct character profile to run such a company, include the devil himself, Hitler and Stalin’s ghost baby and the lady from the video in which she put the cat in a bin."
Choosing The Perfect Pickup Truck You’ll Never Properly Utilise,Colm Williamson,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2023/09/08/choosing-the-perfect-pickup-truck-youll-never-properly-utilise/," ARE you looking for the perfect 3.0 litre pickup truck to help you ferry the odd middle-isle power tool from Lidl or potted plant like some kind of rugged off-grid bourbon drinking lumberjack from Alaska? WWN motoring has you covered. Size Could a small hatchback car provide all your future transport needs? Sure, but owning a huge American style pickup truck looks class and everyone will be like, ‘Jaysis, the size of that yolk, he must be like building difficult stuff with his bare hands and probably has big man calluses and everything and probably eats raw meat too’. We suggest opting for the largest sized engine to carry your 20kg bag of coal because you’re not going to risk struggling with the bigger bag in case you look weak and puny.   Colour Choosing a dark colour pickup is a great way of showing your masculine side, however, we believe purchasing a white pickup can also have some great benefits. Driving a white pickup really gives the impression that you’re comfortable with your sexuality, leaving people to speculate that you bought this monstrosity for practical reasons and not just for show. Adding a huge fuck-off bull bar and set of spotlights can up the masculinity a bit if you are slightly worried that driving a spotless white pickup truck that has never ventured on a road with a middle grass divide may get you a slagging from the lads. Electric or Deisel?  Really? Are you actually contemplating some kind of fully electric or hybrid version of a pickup truck?

"Enough With The Fucking Sourdough, Cafes Told",Colm Williamson,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2023/09/05/enough-with-the-fucking-sourdough-cafes-told/," TIRED with being given sourdough as a standard type of bread-based accompaniment with their meals, Ireland’s cafe and restaurant customers have called on owners and chefs to give it a fucking rest already. “It’s like the panini plague of the early noughties when it seemed there was no other type of bread left in Ireland at the time,” one regular cafe customer recalls, “if I want stale textured air bubbled bread I’ll ask for sourdough, but otherwise just give me the normal, good old fashioned sliced pan for now.   “No one wants an Irish breakfast with fecking sourdough – sure the egg yolk falls through the bloody holes, which is absolute madness”. Noted as a bread for people with notions, sourdough weaseled its way into Irish food menus pre-Covid, before infesting every single cafe, restaurant and fine dining establishment in the country with its pretentious crust. “What pisses me off is the bloody muck isn’t neither sour or doughy,” another normal bread enthusiast pointed out, “besides, it’s far from sourdough most Irish people are raised – it doesn’t even toast nice”. Meanwhile, bakers have confirmed they’re currently deciding on the next big bread fad to flog to the nation. “We’ve gone through baguette, pitta, panini, ciabatta, brioche; I think it’s time to give rye bread a whirl,” one local baker suggested, before being beaten to death."
How Many Puns Can We Get Out Of Durex’s Erection Screw Up?,Julius Hubris,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2023/09/01/how-many-puns-can-we-get-out-of-durexs-erection-screw-up/," RKT-M-36664 CROWDS couldn’t help but stand to attention as they bore witness to Durex’s erection screw up which saw the brand struggle to slide their well-proportioned packaged advert correctly into a prominent Dublin city billboard slot. WWN, ever the respectable news publications with irreproachable journalist integrity has endeavoured to see how many puns it can jam into an article. Beating off stiff competition to the title of most embarrassing advertising faux-pas, Durex’s glorious hole in one came out of nowhere appearing on a billboard at the crack of dawn. “I just heard one worker shout ‘is it in yet?’, and then a lot of heavy breathing and someone shouting, ‘are you mad, it’s not going to fit in there!’ you’d think they would have checked if it fitted first,” said one onlooker. Rumours have spread that it may have been a case of a cocky intern who declined to measure for the pleasure of finishing a job to completion and is now faced with having to go down again to ensure correct entry to the advertising hoarding is achieved. “Just a tip; but it’s best to bring a tape measure to confirm any claims made by someone you’re jumping into bed with, in the business sense of course, at the climax of these things you want to leave satisfied by a job well done but by the looks of it there’s plenty of hammering left to do,” said one billboard fitting expert as workmen stared perplexed at the ill-fitting advertisement. Like trying to pack your sleeping bag back into its sheath after a weekend at a festival, if it’s not the right fit it could end up looking more squeezed than a tube of toothpaste. “I wouldn’t come down too hard on anyone, some people don’t know things don’t fit until doing a bit of research,” added the expert. Elsewhere, Irish men demanded a recount after a research found over 60% of women don’t orgasm every time they have sex. Always read the instructions."
New STD Test Kit Company Delivers Results To Your Workplace Via Brass Band,Julius Hubris,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2023/08/24/new-std-test-kit-company-delivers-results-to-your-workplace-via-brass-band/,"SEEKING to set themselves apart from the crowd of similar companies offering home STD kit tests, Irish business ResultKit have launched a fun new service which sees a brass band coming to your place of work to give you the good or bad news. “It’s just such a serious and boring industry we wanted to stand out from the crowd, y’know innovate don’t stagnate. And so the band was born. This is Dave he’s on gonorrhea trumpet, Emer is on syphilis sax, Will is the preeminent genital herpes French horn player we have,” explained ResultKit founder Andrew Dowling. Dowling explains that each instrument has been designated an STD therefore when a customer hears that instrument take a solo when they burst into their place of work, they have their diagnosis. “It’s a bit of pizzazz that the home STD kit testing industry has been missing, a confirmation text or email feels very impersonal, too private and discreet,” added Dowling, who doubles up on orchestral percussion cymbals whenever someone is getting Hep C news. So far, ResultKit only has happy customers. “Despite the knob rot diagnosis I didn’t have time to feel sad because they was a brass band marching through the office, it broke up what was otherwise a very boring performance view with my boss. And it killed two birds with one stone because we’d had sex last month so technically it was her news too,” said customer Niall Bollins."

Local Woman Appointed New Girl’s ‘Work Mam’ Against Her Will,Julius Hubris,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2023/08/21/local-woman-appointed-new-girls-work-mam-against-her-will/,"FIFTHY FOUR year old Carmel Carmody has slowly come to the realisation that new hire 25-year-old Suzie Higgins has attached herself like barnacle to the secretary in a bid to have all her work done by someone else, namely Carmody. “At first I thought she was just being nice, but after the 4,347th ‘sorry to bother you but quick Q for my Carmel boo’ I realise this work-shy little bitch can’t function by herself,” confirmed Carmody. Admittedly, Carmody confessed to falling for the doe-eyed routine Higgins employed since starting work at Hanley Financial Services in a bid to lighten her workload and have everything done for her. “Before I copped on, I was finishing some of her assignments, asking her boss to go easy on her because she’s a good egg, constantly covering for her. Fuck me, I already have two kids who can barely tie their shoelaces I don’t need a third,” offered Carmody, who has now downgraded Higgins from ‘I see a bit of myself in her’ to ‘right little madam’. Carmody’s unwanted and unaccepted responsibilities now include reminding Higgins of all her looming deadlines, how to formulate emails, pointing out that 2 hours for lunch is excessive and providing tissues for all meltdowns. For her part Higgins just needs to keep up the ‘OMG you’re such a life saver’ routine until she passes her probation period at which point she will plot a promotion to another department and never acknowledge Carmody again."

Elon Musk Declared A Genius After Jamming Fork In Plug Socket,Julius Hubris,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2023/07/24/elon-musk-declared-a-genius-after-jamming-fork-in-plug-socket/,"PLUCKY self-made billionaire and owner of Twitter Elon Musk is once again wowing superfans with his latest incomprehensibly awesome feats of genius, this time repeatedly jamming a fork into a live plug socket. “His genius is limitless, like, no normie would have the intellectual bandwidth to repeatedly electrocute themselves as his handlers beg him to stop. We’re just not worthy, sure he’s cooking his skin and repeatedly saying ‘ow, it stings’ but you just don’t get it, it’s genius,” said one Musk worshiper.  The latest in a long line of truly unique and ambitious moonshots of a brain fart comes after Musk announced Twitter would ditch its bird logo and be called ‘X’. “This is the outside the box thinking that people are jealous of, it’s like Thomas Edison and Albert Einstein ejaculated their collective genius directly onto his brain. It’s branding 101 to announce the replacement of a brand which is so synonymous it’s become a verb, and especially doing it all on a whim because you want to impress strangers on the internet, duh” said one Twitter user, who is possibly Musk’s recently discovered burner account on which he tweets Xs as his 4-year-old son in predictably creepy fashion. “Whatever next? Buying a company for $44bn, presiding over a halving of its ad revenue and then clunkily rebranding it with empty Silicon Valley buzzwords and jargon? ‘X’ like the cancel button or an annoying pop up you want to get rid of? So clever. Sign me up!”"

Buckfast Launch ‘Buckast 0.0’,Colm Williamson,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2023/06/28/buckfast-launch-buckast-0-0/," DO you really enjoy the syrupy cough medicine taste of the popular session tonic wine Buckfast but are currently off the sauce because of its propensity to give you an awful dose of criminal convictions in the morning? Well, there’s some good news on your way as the monks at Buckfast Abbey have now released a brand new 0.0 version. Sick of its poor reputation across the world as being labelled ‘lunatic soup’ and being unable to advertise their products due to strict advertising laws, the holy manufacturers will join the rest of the alcohol distillery world in their quest to put images of this intoxicating beverage into your eyeballs, down your retinas and into your cerebral cortex in a bid to spark your neurons into desiring a taste of alcohol. “Fuck it, we know it will cost us a fortune to make zero alcohol Buckfast that very few people will drink, but being able to advertise it like a normal beverage without all the constraints will boost sales of our original product,” a spokesmonk for the Abbey stated, “Heineken zero, Guinness Zero, fucking gin zero; no cunt in their right mind will enjoy this muck but look it, if it gets us in the back door like the rest of them then it’s worth a fucking shot”. Buckfast 0.0 will still have all the great taste of the original and manufacturers claim it will still make you ‘fuck fast’. “Yeah, there’s still a bucket of caffeine in each fucking bottle that would make a racehorse’s heart explode, so perfect for those skaggy Sunday morning session trips to the shops tripping over your own jaw,” the spokesmonk concluded."

No Evidence That Relying On Handful Of Multi-Nationals For Majority Of Tax Intake Could Back Fire In Anyway,Julius Hubris,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2022/11/03/no-evidence-that-relying-on-handful-of-multi-nationals-for-majority-of-tax-intake-could-back-fire-in-anyway/,"POLICY experts and government advisers have confirmed once again that the vast bulk of the Nation’s corporation tax revenue coming from a handful of companies is merely a sign of an incredibly secure, vibrant and in no way overexposed economy, WWN can reveal. Latest exchequer figures show the State is on course for a record tax take, due in no small part to the outsized contribution of just 10 multi-national companies who account for more than 60% of corporate tax receipts. “I’ve yet to see a compelling case made for how this could ever screw Ireland over, not even if there was an impending international recession, which last time I checked hasn’t been predicted anywhere,” shared one local businessman, who sold CDs out of a van. “Corporation tax receipts were up 72% on last year, now I’m no economist but how could that sort of growth ever slow,” added Minister for Finance Pascal Donohoe, before calling Ireland’s economy ‘robust’ just 74 times in under a minute. Keen to stress that this sort of over reliance does not need addressing in any way, Tániste Leo Varadkar has ordered all future Commission on Taxation reports to be pulped lest they once again suggest an increase in inheritance and income taxes. Measures currently under consideration by the government include: – A Sinn Féin tax which will see Pearse Doherty forced to cough up money every time he mentions a wealth tax. – Politely asking energy companies if they’d consider agreeing to being subjected to a ‘windfall tax’, not before 2065 but no worries if not. – Sitting on hands for next 40 years and posting a ‘shocked Pikachu’ face whenever the shit hits the fan."

Aer Lingus Blame Outage On Lad Turning His Phone On Before Plane Reached Terminal,Gerry McBride,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2022/09/12/aer-lingus-blame-outage-on-lad-turning-his-phone-on-before-plane-reached-terminal/," THOUSANDS of stranded passengers who missed out on flights from Dublin Airport at the weekend have been told to aim their blame at Meath man Cathal Durkan, who ‘just couldn’t wait’ until his flight from Newcastle had reached the terminal before checking his WhatsApp messages.   Durkan, who had been on a combination work event/ piss-up in England the previous day went on to apologise for his part in the outage, while Aer Lingus and the DAA made sure that everyone knew that this one ‘wasn’t on them’. “We warn you people about this every god damned time,” shrugged Aer Lingus, who cancelled 52 flights at short notice on Saturday amid a ‘catastrophic operational failure’ which was later revealed to be Durkan sending ‘man with big dick’ memes to his pals. “The announcement is always ‘don’t turn on your phone until you reach the terminal’, but this dumbnuts went ahead and switched off his flight mode and boom, shutdown. So, if you missed out on a wedding or a funeral or a concert or whatever, don’t blame us. It’s bad enough you all were blaming us for the security mess earlier in the year when it was all you panicky animals arriving four hours early that caused the whole thing”. Meanwhile, passengers seeking a refund for the disruption have been advised to just let it go. What do they think is going to happen? They’re going to get compensated for their troubles in a swift and hassle-free manner? Cop on lads, this is Ireland."

Twitter Accuses Musk Of Withholding Data About Offering Woman Horse In Exchange For ‘Erotic Massage’,Julius Hubris,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2022/06/08/twitter-accuses-musk-of-withholding-data-about-offering-woman-horse-in-exchange-for-erotic-massage/,"IN THE WAKE of Elon Musk attempting to back out of his deal to acquire Twitter citing a lack of satisfaction around the user data disclosed by the social media company, Twitter have raised their own concerns WWN Tech can reveal. “Nevermind Twitter bot numbers, eh, when were you going to tell us you’re a free speech champion who also gets employees to sign an NDA when you whip out your little boring tunnel and ask them for a happy ending?” one Twitter board member asked Musk, now that they’re on the subject of withholding important information. “It would have been very cool to have disclosed the fact he allegedly paid an employee $250,000 in exchange for silence after exposing his penis to her,” added a Twitter shareholder who was now offering to buy Musk a horse in exchange for just shutting up for two seconds.  A rare genius businessman, Musk’s most recent innovation has been to tank both Tesla and Twitter stock while cutting an embarrassing and desperate figure in tweets. “No, I’m glad we know all this now, it’s finally starting to make sense; of course only an idiot who innovated the ‘look my penis, touch penis, I buy you horse’ form of harassment could think buying this hellsite I’ve invested in was a good idea,” confirmed another Twitter shareholder. Sadly such is the recent dive in Tesla stock price, in the future Musk will only be able to offer employees a hamster in exchange for sex.  Elsewhere, a new survey revealed that 100% of people said if they were the richest person in the world they would simply not spend day-in, day-out making a complete tit of themselves on Twitter and heaping fresh humiliation on themselves."

How Elon Musk Went From Childhood Poverty To Being One Of The Richest Men In The World,Gerry McBride,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2022/04/05/how-elon-musk-went-from-childhood-poverty-to-being-one-of-the-richest-men-in-the-world/,"BILLIONAIRE Elon Musk’s acquisition of a 9.2% share in Twitter is just the latest development in fairytale story of the South African’s journey from being the impoverished son of a poor emerald miner, to being the richest men in the world. “Elon’s father Errol once said that the family had so much money, they couldn’t even close their safe,” said one Musk historian, painting a bleak picture of a white South African family who weren’t even able to afford a bigger safe. “Although Elon is known today as a man with more money than he could possibly know what to do with, in the 80s his wealth didn’t even put him anywhere near the top of the Forbes list. Can you imagine what that must have been like for someone like Musk, who really, really wanted to have more money than some entire nations? Hell”. Musk’s riches-to-even-more-riches journey calls to mind the rise of other billionaires such as Donald Trump, who had to make do with a paltry $1m loan from his father when starting his first business. “Of course, you could become a billionaire too under such circumstances, but you’d probably just squander it on fast food and alcohol,” added our source. “People like Elon, Bezos, Trump, Kim Kardashian, Epstein. Why shouldn’t they have billions of dollars, don’t they deserve it? Haven’t they suffered on the fringes of the Forbes Top 10 for long enough? “. Meanwhile, Musk will use his new clout at Twitter to implement a new system where everyone who joins the platform automatically follows him, much like that dork on MySpace used to do."

Skims Sweatshop Worker Inspired By Kim Kardashian’s ‘Get Off Your Ass & Work’ Advice,Julius Hubris,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2022/03/10/skims-sweatshop-worker-inspired-by-kim-kardashians-get-off-your-ass-work-advice/,"ONE worker bringing shapewear solutions SKIMS to consumers via a production line with a stellar track record in employee rights has formally thanked Kim Kardashian for her words of encouragement in a recent Variety interview in which she advised women in business ‘to get up off your fucking ass and work. It seems like nobody wants to work anymore’. “Technically we’re not allowed sit during our shift or we’ll be fired but I still thank Kim for her inspiring words,” shared one Chinese based worker, of indeterminate age. “It was just the kick up the ass I needed, yes my hands are sore, I’m not earning enough to even live but Kim is just so inspiring. It’s like hashtag girl boss, hashtag believe, hashtag bow down bitches, maybe I can ask for more than my usual hours of 84 for this week,” added the worker during the sort of 45 second break that could get her fired. “To see what can be achieve by someone who knows what it’s like to lie on her back to go on to become inspirational business owner and still remain completely in touch with reality, I’m going to stitch twice as hard as I’m forced to. This is just the boost I needed post International Women’s Day,” concluded the worker. Other nuggets of wisdom Kardashian shared during her Variety interview included: “Be born into rich family”. “When you’re sued for violating labour laws and you allegedly failed to pay overtime, cover expenses and provide legally mandated breaks, just let your team of laywers handle it”. “Have you tried not being poor, idiot”. “Agree to have your image and name licenced by large consumer businesses who then produce endless products so you can pretend like it was all your own genius at work”. “Talk about the importance of women in business while presiding over toxic working conditions which exploit people and offer unpaid internships only”. “Stealing ideas from other people is free”."

Burrito Place Implements Mandatory Tattoo Policy For Staff,Gerry McBride,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2021/12/13/burrito-place-implements-mandatory-tattoo-policy-for-staff/,"APPLICANTS for customer-facing roles at a new Waterford burrito bar will require a minimum of one arm completely covered in tattoos, although people with a face-full of piercings will also be favourably considered. “We can’t be the only burrito place in town where the staff all have their natural hair colour” explained Luke Ingleson, owner of Los Deise Banditos as he trawled through CVs. “People just expect it at this stage. If they come in to get a burrito and the guy or lady serving them doesn’t have guaged-out ears, they’ll just walk out the door. It’s like a mark of quality at this stage”. The dawn of the heavily-tattooed food service worker has been greatly welcomed by many in Waterford, who now have the perfect fuck-off line to anyone who slagged them off for their body art. “My dad used to look at my tattoos and say ‘where are you going to get a job with all those’. Of course, this was before the burrito bar explosion in Ireland. Now, I’ve my pick of employers” said one young man waiting for an interview, with his sleeves rolled up to show off his tattoos of a giant-sized Olive Oyl from Popeye fist-fighting Godzilla. Anyone with less than the required amount of inked skin is still welcome to apply for roles in Los Deise Banditos, but will be resigned to jobs in the kitchen in the back or in the office, where their bland appearances will not be forced upon the customer."

Shatner Sent To Work In Amazon Factory Until He Pays Back Cost Of Space Flight,Julius Hubris,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2021/10/14/shatner-sent-to-work-in-amazon-factory-until-he-pays-back-cost-of-space-flight/,"AFTER the overwhelming and euphoric adrenaline rush slowly receded from his body, Captain Kirk aka William Shatner aka The Oldest Man In Space was brought crashing back down to earth by the small print in the contract he signed with Blue Origin billionaire Jeff Bezos. “What are you, 90 years old? You going for a piss break won’t be a problem your colostomy bag probably has its own colostomy bag, right? Haha,” said Bezos as he showed an ashen faced Shatner around the Amazon factory he will be working in until the full cost of his space flight is paid off. After given Shatner a tour of all places workers collapsed and died of exhaustion, Bezos lightened the mood by revealing he had accumulated an extra 100 million to his fortune since they walked into the facility 10 seconds ago. “Always read the small print William. Fair is fair, everyone has got to pay their way. Well, not me when it comes to taxes but you get the idea. You thought the trip was free? C’mon, I’m not made of money?” said Bezos as his solid gold body shone under the factory lights. Wearing a back brace to help with lifting heavy packages over the course of a 12-hour shift with no let up, it is believed that based on entry level pay for an Amazon factory worker, Shatner will be free of his debts sometime after the 4th Cyborg Wars in the early 44th century. “Oh and you see that guy over there,” said Bezos pointing to an intimidating security guard, “I call him Will Break Your Legs If You Even Think About Unionising, bet you’ll never guess how he got that name?” Bezos asked Shatner, who was beginning to regret his trip in the billionaire’s dick rocket."

Stay Warm This Winter By Burning Leaflets From Politicians Promising They’ll Sort Everything,Gerry McBride,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2021/09/24/stay-warm-this-winter-by-burning-leaflets-from-politicians-promising-theyll-sort-everything-2/,"SAVVY householders may be able to escape savage energy price hikes if they had the foresight to keep the easily combustible pamphlets distributed by their local TDs over the last few years, WWN can confirm. “In most locales around the country, government TDs have issued leaflets year-round promising that their constituents are ‘doing fine and will continue to do fine’, so if you have a big stack of those in your house you could have a really nice fire and it won’t cost you anything” said one cost-cutting guru we spoke to. “Other than that, spending thousands to insulate your home to an A+ rating, switching your boiler, washing machine, dishwasher, fridge, personal massage devices and slow cookers to more energy efficient models and changing all your bulbs to energy saving ones could save you as much as 67c over the course of the next two winters”. Meanwhile the government has assured the public that it will introduce a number of measures in the budget to ensure that people will be able to pay their energy bills with taxpayer money. “There are struggling energy companies out there that have graciously kept their price hikes down to only 20%, so we’re going to make sure they don’t lose a cent more” said our source. “You pay us, we pay you, you pay them. If only we could put a dynamo on the flow of taxpayer money to private corporations, we’d be able to power the nation for years”. The government was quick to add that data centres are not the cause of any upcoming energy shortages that the nation may or may not experience in the coming winter, honest."

Gardaí Seize €7mn Worth Of Plant That Generates Billions In Tax Revenue In Modern Countries,Julius Hubris,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2021/02/12/gardai-seize-e7mn-worth-of-plant-that-generates-billions-in-tax-revenue-in-modern-countries/,"THE DEPARTMENT of Justice was quick to praise hard working members of an Garda Síochána as it seized €7 million worth of an illicit substance referred to in other countries as ‘product belonging to a viable tax generating business’. While drug gangs continue to do harm through violence and intimidation around the country, the Irish government has redoubled its commitment to retaining cannabis’s illicit contraband reputation in tact for fear legalising and regulating the sale of the substance would turn Dublin’s streets into a warzone where gangs kill each other. “Why legitimise such a substance, what’s the benefit? Taking it out of the hands of criminals and make it something regulated that the state can derive income from? But then what would the gardaí do?” confirmed a Department of Justice spokesperson unaware of the existence of other crimes. Now covering his ears and cowering in fear, the spokesperson screeched ‘make it stop’ as journalists asked if Ireland would be better served taking cannabis out of the dark alleyways and into legitimate weed dispensaries as seen in other countries. “Sorry, we’re not a mad banana republic like those backward basket cases countries,” confirmed the spokesperson of Canada and America. “You may want to live in a hellish nightmare dystopia where Garda resources are diverted to other less serious crimes than smoking a joint, but this is Ireland, and we take this seriously,” concluded the spokesperson. Elsewhere, gardaí stated they were unsure legalisation would work as large crowds exiting dispensaries all at the once at closing time could result in devastating assaults on snack sections of shops, carried out lethargically by chilled out people in the throws of a fits of giggles."

Local Woman Wouldn’t Have Married Husband If She’d Known How Loud He Typed,Gerry McBride,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2020/10/09/local-woman-wouldnt-have-married-husband-if-shed-known-how-loud-he-typed/,"“I suppose this is what they meant by ‘for better or worse'” sighed Waterford woman Erin Sheerin, trying her best to get a bit of her own work done by blocking out the noise of her husband Dylan hammering at his computer keyboard like it owed him money. “But I swear, if I’d known that five years after we got married we’d be working from home together and I’d have to listen to him typing for six hours a day, I’d have ran screaming down the aisle, out into the car and away to a new life with someone who can type like a normal person”. The Sheerin family are just one couple who have had to seek marriage guidance in a Covid-19 world, as work-from-home set-ups expose spouses to personality traits that they had never witnessed before; the most common of which being excessively loud typing. “It’s like listening to a cow pissing on a wet road” sobbed Mrs. Sheerin, as her husband pounded out another email. “Listen to me type – see? You can barely hear it. Now listen to his – it sounds like a fucking landslide. Is that what his office was like on a normal day? A hundred people clattering away like that? Or do I just have the one husband who either can’t type quietly or is so much of a prick that he doesn’t care? Either way, this wedding ring never felt heavier”. Mr. Sheerin was unavailable for comment as he was typing a particularly angry email, raising the decibel level in the house to roadworks levels of noise."

God Announces Cutbacks As Religious Donations Plummet,Colm Williamson,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2020/05/19/god-announces-cutbacks-as-religious-donations-plummet/,"THE kingdom of heaven is expected to undergo major austerity measures over the coming months as the Lord God almighty announced major cutbacks, WWN has learned. Citing a massive plunge in religious donations on Earth, God stated that billions of euros has so far been lost thanks to the ongoing global lockdown. “It’s my own fault for allowing the Coronavirus virus to mutate from animal to human,” the 4-billion-year-old wrote, “I was actually trying to curb the dangerously rising population down there and it all just of kinda backfired on me – my bad”. The measures are expected to see dozens of layoffs in God’s kingdom, including some senior angels and saints being offered voluntary redundancies. “How do I feel? I’m fucking outraged to tell you the God’s honest truth,” exclaimed Saint Peter, who has been acting as keeper of the keys to the kingdom for the past two thousand years, “I’m being replaced with a bloody automated barrier gate and the golden gates are being sold off for scrap to a Cash 4 Gold shop, so I said fuck that – I’ve applied for a similar position in hell where the money is sweet”. Up until now, billions of euros of tax free revenue has been funnelled into the kingdom of heaven thanks to donations from worshippers on the ground, but revenue streams were cut due to the lockdown. “If there’s one thing I really need right now is money, so if you can all get back to normal down there that would be super,” God’s statement ended."

‘Priority’ Passengers Still Queuing Like A Pack Of Dopes,Colm Williamson,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2019/03/26/priority-passengers-still-queuing-like-a-pack-of-dopes/,"A NEW report into ‘priority’ passengers using budget airlines has found the large majority of them are still queuing like a pack of dopes, despite paying extra for their journeys. With priority queues now almost double that of non-priority queues, the report found priority passengers are most likely to stand and wait for long periods if they pay for the service, while their counterparts sit patiently and wait for all of them to board. “Sure, God love them, they’ve been standing there obediently for 40 minutes now,” scoffed non-priority passenger Martin Davis, from the comfort of a seat at gate D7 departing for Rome while citing the airline’s sales pitch to ‘sit down and get comfortable before everyone else boards’. “Who wants to sit on a plane longer than they should? I usually let everyone get on first and then get up, have a nice little stretch and then board the plane; sure it’s the same fecking seat I’ll be sitting in any way. What’s so priority about it?” Charging up to 20 euros to queue in a parallel line, budget airline Ryanair has defended the system, stating that priority queues give their customers an air of self importance and fills a psychological gap left there by their dreadful decision to fly with Ryanair. “I suppose it makes a bad situation better for them,” explained a Ryanair spokesperson, “kinda like when they used to put African Americans to the back of the bus: it made the white people feel better about themselves traveling on public transport”."

"Apple Billionaire Granny Smith Dies, Age 91",Julius Hubris,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2018/08/09/apple-billionaire-granny-smith-dies-age-91/,"Granny Smith, the famed Apple magnate whose fortune is valued at €193 billion has died at the age of 91. Georgia Smith was of course more affectionately known as Granny Smith by the rivals she ruthlessly wiped out in the incredibly bloody ‘Apple Wars’ feud of the 1950s.  Her resulting victory in the conflict carved a path for Smith to monopolise the apple market by lodging the original patent for the apple, ultimately meaning her company and her company alone could produce apples to sell on to consumers. Smith famously came up with the marketing gimmick ‘an apple a day keeps the doctor away’. The campaign proved so successful, thousands of people died subsisting on a health regime of eating apples and never going to the doctor, however, multiple lawsuits against Smith for openly offering bogus health advice were thrown out of court. Smith stayed true to the family business of apple selling despite brief dalliances with technology and the music industry. Smith refocused her efforts on establishing Apple-selling dominance and sold off the music publishing wing of the company to struggling musicians from Liverpool before later selling off the technology strand of the business to a college dropout from California. Using seed money acquired via an inheritance from Maria Ann Smith, her grandmother and orchardist, Smith grew the business to what it is today with Apple stores all over the world. However, the presence of inferior and counterfeit apples persists. “You know those dry, horrible, moisture-less ‘apples’ that you find in a corner shop or petrol station that look like they’ve been sitting there for weeks on end, those aren’t the real deal,” explained Smith’s widower Grandad Smith. “Helluva women, my wife” he added, “absolutely hated the taste of apples though, more of an orange woman but that’s a story for another day”."

New Dietary Laws Demand Church Put Nutritional Information On Communion Wafers,Gerry McBride,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2017/08/24/new-dietary-laws-demand-church-put-nutritional-information-on-communion-wafers/,"STRICT new rules surrounding the distribution of edibles deities will come into place at the start of next year, forcing the Catholic Church to make a full list of dietary information available to everyone they give Holy Communion to. Until now, the church was free to pass out communion wafers without informing their congregation as to the country of origin, calorie count, or saturated fat content of the hosts. The new ruling comes after a number of lawsuits involving incredibly devout parishioners who would receive communion up to four times a day, unaware of the health ramifications involved in eating that much Jesus. Now morbidly obese, the self-described ‘Fatholics’ took their lawsuit to the high court, resulting in the ruling that will see chalices inscribed with details of fat and salt content, as well as a list of allergens. “Forget about sin, what about syns?” moaned one Fatholic, who piled on nearly a stone at a novena last year, “if McDonalds have to stick nutritional information on their packaging, then the church should do so too. “It’s amazing that they got away with it for so long. Who knows what we were eating all this time. Are we sure it’s 100% Christ? Is there a possibility that it’s made from reformed apostles? It’s time we found out and put this baby Jesus to bed”. The church has also vowed to replace the blood of Christ with Blood Zero, same great taste, zero calories."

Man Somehow Describing Himself As ‘Expert Creative Strategic Thinker’ On LinkedIn,Julius Hubris,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2017/01/25/man-somehow-describing-himself-as-expert-creative-strategic-thinker-on-linkedin/,"GOING against all expert advice on how to construct your LinkedIn page, one Dublin ‘thought leader’ has used their profile summary to state the 18 different ways in which they are an ‘expert creative strategic thinker’ with the aid of an online thesaurus. Gavin Hemmings is believed to belong to the small group of professionals who wrongly believe the use of empty buzzwords will enhance their chances of taking the next step up on the career ladder. “For starters ‘expert creative strategic thinker’ makes as much sense as frying an ice cube,” shared recruitment expert Elena Martin, “he’ll stand a better chance with a more direct and clear approach that gets rid his profile of the ‘specialised entrepreneurial imaginator’ stuff. Imaginator isn’t even a word”. Martin praised Hemming for not including a photoshopped picture of himself next to Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates or Elon Musk, but insisted a reduction in his use of buzzwords from over 1,000 down to zero would help the 28-year-old immensely. Despite mentioning how he has ‘pivoted’ toward more ‘strategic work’ some 20 times in just three brief paragraphs, Hemmings thought it best to show no examples of relevant work which highlights his six impressive years in financial services. Experts have suggested stating your achievements, and then backing them up with concrete examples relating to your career thus far is a more potent interview tool than repeating nonsensical phrases such as ‘envisionator’, ‘change enabler’ and ‘opportunity facilitator’. If Hemmings fails to heed any of this simple advice, Martin confirmed his LinkedIn profile could have a career in showing people how not to set up a profile. Elsewhere, there has been a nationwide appeal for the Nation’s workers to bring an end to the phrase ‘touch base with you’. [WWN-Post-Info-Box]Banish the buzzwords and update your LinkedIn profile today. #StartSomething [/WWN-Post-Info-Box]"

“How I Made My Fortune By Stealing Pens From Work”,Julius Hubris,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2016/04/11/how-i-made-my-fortune-by-stealing-pens-from-work/,"MAKING your fortune is fairly straightforward if you steal copious amounts of Bic biros from your employer, millionaire entrepreneur Eoin Slaney tells WWN. “It’s basic business stuff, you just steal a load of shit and then sell it for money. I did it for over 15 years, and I’m happy to say I’m now filthy rich. My game was the storage closet in work, they had mountains of pens, but honestly you can steal other stuff too. I just wasn’t arsed as big boxes of staplers are too heavy to carry, and after losing a finger I learned my lesson when it came to carrying loads of scissors” The wise words of business guru Eoin Slaney, who spoke at length in the Convention Centre this morning to business leaders, explaining his path from call centre worker to multi-millionaire. “They say do what you know, so when everyone in the old office started saying ‘we’ve no pens’, I told them the wife steals loads from work and that I could sell some to the company. Bingo. My first client. My product cost me nothing, and so the markup was a serious part of why the money started rolling in”. Eoin spoke of how the business further expanded to keep up with demand. “You see, I’d steal back the pens I just sold the office, so that started an endless cycle of selling the same pens over and over again. I was making 4 or 5 trips to the storage closet to nick them back almost every day. Then I also sold a few to my son’s school, as I had begun training him up in the family business”. With Eoin, his wife and his son all stealing pens from their places of work, the profits were through the roof, but further expansion was eyed up by visionary entrepreneur. “Pens was the present. And I knew pens would be the future too. I was stealing some change out of a Trocaire box when it dawned on me, the lads on the Trocaire boxes are always in need of pens. so I volunteered with several charities and donated loads of pens, only to steal them back again. Are you identifying the business model yet? They felt so guilty that they had lost my donation, they insisted on paying for replacement pens and I was only too happy to supply them”. The entrepreneur admits that his career was not without its setbacks. “We got into the adopting kids from abroad game, and selling them to needy couples. So we’d sell a kid to a couple, but when we stole the child back and tried to charge them again for a replacement, they could tell right away. Pens all look the same, so we stuck with pens after that”. Did this inspire you to pursue your business dream? Share your ideas below."

"Starters Overpriced Because We Can, Confirm Restaurants",Colm Williamson,https://waterfordwhispersnews.com/2016/01/14/starters-overpriced-because-we-can-confirm-restaurants/,"THE Restaurants Association of Ireland has today defended over-priced starter dishes, stating the course is priced that way because they can. Chief Executive of the group, Aidan Carroll, said petite starter courses ranging anywhere between €7 and €40 were “all part of the game” and that customers should shut their bloody mouths if they can’t see the reasoning behind the extortionate prices. “Yeah, starters are a bit of a con, so what?” Carroll told WWN. “Four garlic mushrooms, bit of garlic mayo, splash of lettuce, nine euro or fuck off to McDonald’s with yourself,” before asking “What, early birds menus not cheap enough for ye?” Asked whether he had any explanation at all behind the ridiculous charge, he replied: “Yeah, to make a 500% markup on profits, you gobshite”. Since the outbreak of celebrity chefs, cookery shows and general consumerism, starter options have almost quadrupled since 1994, back when the only option was a prawn cocktail. “We’ve come a long way since then,” Waterford chef Timothy Doyle explained. “Now we have bruschetta, which is basically a bit of bread and some chopped tomatoes (€8.99), Deep fried Brie, which is a cube of cheese (€14) and impossible to eat crab claws that costs more than most main courses. Essentially, people are idiots”. The Restaurants Association of Ireland confirmed it will not be addressing over-priced, second-rate food anytime soon."
