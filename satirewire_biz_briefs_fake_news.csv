"In event of cabin pressure change, air Canada instructs passengers to secure own mask before 360 roundhouse kicking the person next to them",Simon Paluck,https://www.thebeaverton.com/2023/10/in-event-of-cabin-pressure-change-air-canada-instructs-passengers-to-secure-own-mask-before-360-roundhouse-kicking-the-person-next-to-them/,"THE SKY – Air Canada has recently released an update to their on-board safety procedures where, in the event of a cabin pressure change, they’re now instructing passengers to 360 roundhouse kick the person next to them only after they’ve secured their own oxygen mask. “I know it is human nature,” began Air Canada flight attendant Miguel Ferez during the onboard safety demonstration, “to want to tend to the person next to you before yourself but as the saying goes: you can’t help others if you’re dead.” Reader’s note: Ferez continued to demonstrate the new MASK FIRST/ KICK SECOND safety protocol on his fellow flight attendant.  “So, in the unlikely event the oxygen masks do drop down,” motions Ferez, “secure the straps to your own face before securing a swift kick to the face of the person next to you. Otherwise, there will be two people left unconscious and that’s just double trouble.”  Ferez then added, “Okay, Jean-Luc get up. It’s time to say that all again but in French…” In a report released by Air Canada, the new MASK FIRST/ KICK SECOND mandate has proven to be the most effective way to mitigate risk during an in-flight cabin pressure change. “The trick is not to panic,” explains Trisha Duluth, Air Canada spokesperson. “Especially if you’re traveling with an elderly person or a child under three. Air Canada wants you to remain calm, reach for your own oxygen mask first, and then, release a flying scissor kick to that old geezer, second. Safety fucking first.” According to Duluth Air Canada is also in the process of updating their other emergency policies – like in the event of a water landing, reach under your seat to grab your personal flotation device before putting your seat-buddy into a choke hold and to make sure the floating slide is fully deployed before delivering a flying elbow to someone’s knee. “Rest assured smoking is still prohibited on all flights.” Following Air Canada, other airlines are reportedly in the process of revolutionizing their own policies and procedures except United Airlines, who’s on-board violence already happens naturally."
Meeting on grocery prices stalls as CEOs send Trudeau to self-serve negotiator,Ian MacIntyre,https://www.thebeaverton.com/2023/09/meeting-on-grocery-prices-stalls-as-ceos-send-trudeau-to-self-serve-negotiator/,"OTTAWA – A meeting convened with Canada’s top grocery CEOs to discuss soaring prices stalled this week, as the executives directed Trudeau to conduct his own discussion with their automated self-serve negotiator. “Canadians are hurting due to skyrocketing grocery prices, and today we’re going to do something about it,” Trudeau declared directly to the automated kiosk’s bright LED monitor. Though executives from Loblaw, Metro, Empire, Walmart, and Costco were not in attendance, Canada’s Prime Minister gamely attempted to deliver his message by navigating the machine’s various touch screen options. While Prime Minister Trudeau, as well as Finance Minister Freeland and Minister of Innovation Champagne, had expected to meet with the human CEOs and top VPs of the grocery chains, they were reportedly surprised when the only option available was the newly-designed Executron-3000.  Calling the meetings “historic and constructive”, Trudeau and his assembled ministers set to work admonishing the self-service machine about this year’s 8.5 per cent rise in grocery prices, as well as companies’ record profits. “I think I’m really getting through to it,” Trudeau declared confidently, before pressing the on-screen icon for ‘lower grocery prices’, but then somehow being directed back to the main menu. Reports indicate that Trudeau did not have enough Optimum points to redeem for a nationwide price freeze.  “It says here I can’t scan and have to manually enter the code for ‘examine record profit margins’, which I thought I did, but then I just get an error saying something about ‘supply chain costs’,” Trudeau added in frustration, as the self-serve meeting stretched on far past the scheduled time. “It would have been way faster to just do this with a human being,” Freeland noted, before a light flashed, and a prompt directed the elected officials to stand by and wait for a floor manager to key in their override code.  While Canada’s Federal Liberals have had strong words for grocery CEOs, particularly in the face of low polling numbers, Trudeau dismissed concerns that the industry leaders were not taking him seriously by sending the Executron-3000 in their place. “I’m sure that doing all the negotiating myself with this machine will result in some kind of cost savings, that will then be passed on to Canadian consumers,” Trudeau added, before being charged a 5¢ ‘political grandstanding fee’. The kiosk then displayed a standard corporate charity prompt, asking, “Would you like to give us a $10 million tax credit?” though there appeared to be no option to decline. Reached for comment, Loblaws executive chairman and president Galen Weston Jr. responded, “I’ll have another mimosa,” from 41,000 ft in the air aboard his private Gulfstream V jet.  In a related story, Trudeau’s affordability meeting with the heads of Canada’s major housing construction firms hit a snag when he discovered he would be CEOS had instead sent an unplugged cement mixer for him to talk to."
"To combat self-checkout theft, stores experimenting with new human cashier pilot program",Jacob Pacey,https://www.thebeaverton.com/2023/09/to-combat-self-checkout-theft-stores-experimenting-with-new-human-cashier-pilot-program/,"OAKVILLE, ON – Following a rise in self-checkout theft driven by increased prices, a consortium of Canadian retailers announced a new experimental pilot program replacing self-checkouts with actual live human cashiers. “With prices of groceries, toiletries, and other necessities of living rapidly rising, we’ve experienced a rise in flesh consumers abusing our perfect automated self-checkouts,” said Jenny MacNeil, a spokesperson for the Canadian Consortium of Retailers. According to MacNeil, retailers who bestowed upon consumers complete responsibility for conducting their own purchases have been blindsided by the recent rise in casual theft.  “There was no way any of our various MBA VPs could have seen this coming,” explains MacNeil. In response to the trend, the consortium engaged consulting firm McKinsey, who after $400M of comprehensive behavioural research, made the unorthodox recommendation that retailers consider replacing automated computer checkouts with anthropoid-based checkouts — a world first, according to McKinsey.  “After hundreds of focus groups, it became clear that making customers become temporary employees of a store for the duration of their purchase presented a profound conflict of interest that had not been hitherto anticipated,” reads the opening paragraph of the report, which called the transition to human cashiers a “tectonic shift”. “Consumers have been conducting their own checkouts for the whole history of commerce,” continues the report. “To now have another human being assist in that process is going to be a big adjustment, but we’re confident that in a short amount of time consumers will grow so used to human checkouts they’ll forget the way things used to be.” While the plan presents some upfront costs initially, retailers say the plan will help save them money in the long run. “Having a human being ring through and properly verify items acts as a deterrent for casual thieves. It’s really a wonder no one thought of this before,” explains Loss Prevention Consultant James Callum. Retailers taking part in the pilot program say that the implementation of the plan to date has been extremely smooth.  “Hiring and training cashiers has been quite effortless,” says Human Resources Director Trish Cavinaugh of Loblaws. “Early on in the process, we found there was a very large pool of job seekers who possessed an incredible aptitude for doing this type of work, it was almost like they had done it before.” For their part, early users of the human cashiers expressed support for the program, explaining that they appreciated the ability to buy goods without donating unpaid labour to retailers. “They don’t just ring through your items,” explains Josh Chang. “They greet you, make corrections if the price is wrong. They sometimes even help you bag! It’s really a great innovation, I hope they stick with it.” At press time, the Retail Consortium indicated that results were so positive that members were exploring ways to make even more money, with some beginning to experiment with saving money on cashiers by replacing them with self-checkouts."

Canada’s grocery companies pretending not to hear about falling inflation rate,Megan MacKay,https://www.thebeaverton.com/2023/07/canadas-grocery-companies-pretending-not-to-hear-about-falling-inflation-rate/,"OTTAWA – Statistics Canada reports that the national inflation rate has fallen for a second consecutive month, and the nation’s grocery stores are dutifully pretending not to hear about it. “Oh, inflation’s down? I’d have to check on that,” commented Loblaws spokesperson Lucinda Thatcher. “I haven’t had a chance to read the news yet today. Or last month. Really on a media detox over here. Have you checked Facebook? There’s nothing about it on Facebook!” Canada’s inflation rate has fallen to 2.8%, comfortably sitting in the Bank of Canada’s target inflation range for the first time in months. Yet the prices for grocery staples continue to ratchet higher and higher, becoming unattainable for any Canadians who need food and water to survive.  Independent consumer watchdog Aaron Anderson has tried to get the message to grocery corporations – with minimal success. “I’ve contacted a few PR reps at different companies,”  Anderson said. “But emails get lost, calls get dropped, and faxes get responded to with crude children’s drawings of a graph showing inflation going up. One in-person meeting ended with an exec running from the room while plugging his ears and saying ‘lalala, our bread prices have always been normal!’ In a singsongy voice.” As a response to falling inflation, the C-suite at Metro HQ has instructed their IT department to block all news sites on company equipment. Loblaws’ new ‘It’s All Good’ internal program rewards employees for discussing comparatively benign news items, like the weather, or the Barbie movie, or how if a nationwide class war broke out, it would be definitely totally unrelated to food prices. Meanwhile, the CEO of Sobeys was found in their server room aggressively chewing on an old phone cord so “those damned telegrams couldn’t get through to the skirts on the switchboard.”  Back at Loblaws, the response remained firm. “We have no control over our prices – our suppliers fleece us, and we pass that fleecing onto the consumer,” explained Thatcher, when forced to acknowledge three ironclad pieces of proof of falling inflation using the eyeball thingy from A Clockwork Orange. “Then price stickers show up on our shelves overnight, like they were placed by a tooth fairy or a babadook-type creature. Do you really want to confront the grocery babadook? I don’t think so.”  When reached for comment about the government’s inaction in combating grocers’ “ignorance-based greedflation,” multiple MPs from each federal party commented “Oh, grocery prices are high? Huh. I hadn’t heard about that. I’ll have to get back to you.”"
Loblaws raises price of bread to exact amount of federal grocery rebate,Jacob Pacey,https://www.thebeaverton.com/2023/07/loblaws-raises-price-of-bread-to-exact-amount-of-federal-grocery-rebate/,"BRAMPTON – In an effort to help Canadians struggling with inflation, Loblaws announced that they will be permanently pegging the price of bread to the exact amount of money a single adult is entitled to under the federal government’s Grocery Rebate Program, or $234 per loaf. “We hear from Canadians that they’re more stretched than ever, for reasons certainly unrelated to our grocery stores,” said Loblaws spokesperson Stephanie Willice at a Loblaws Corporate Town Hall.  “By pricing bread in accordance with the exact amount of money given to them by the government to help afford groceries, we ensure that we will never make them pay more than we know they can afford,” said Willice to the thundering applause of Loblaws executives. According to Willice, the pricing of bread will vary slightly depending on household composition, explaining that while a single adult qualifies for $234 dollars of support from the government and therefore can expect to pay $234 dollars for one loaf of bread, a two-adult household can expect to receive $306 dollars plus an additional $81 dollars per child, and therefore will pay $467 for a loaf of bread. According to Loblaws, the new program is just the first in a series of initiatives meant to help Canadians struggling with stubbornly high grocery prices, even as inflation cools. The company also announced they would soon be launching  a program tying the cost of diapers and baby formula to the Canada Child Benefit, and would also be making the price of plastic recycling bags commensurate with the amount paid out to Canadians via the Climate Action Incentive. “By raising our prices to the exact amount of money given out by the government to help endure our prices, we ensure our groceries will remain affordable for all Canadians as long as the government keeps giving them money,” stated Willis.  In Ottawa, politicians lauded the program, saying it provided a great example of how to make the transfer of government money to Loblaws even more frictionless, and announced a pilot program with the Canada Revenue Agency which would give Canadians the option to have their relief payments skip their bank accounts entirely and be sent directly to Galen Weston’s bank account in exchange for 1000 Optimum points.   “At present, giving out hundreds of millions of dollars to taxpayers to then give directly to Loblaws is the only avenue we have of dealing with the high cost of groceries,” said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. “What do Canadians expect me to do, regulate them with laws?”  “In Canada we have free market capitalism, we can’t interfere in private commerce… unless it’s to loan Air Canada billions of dollars, or give billions we gave to the oil and gas sector, or I guess there was also that one time we gifted Loblaws $12M dollars of freezers for some reason…” trailed off the Prime Minister. “But that was different, in those cases we were giving them money. We can’t do anything to interfere that would result in them losing money, unless it’s through taxes which they will inevitably find ways to avoid through offshore banking.”"
Queen’s University offers Musk 8 dollars a month to stop telling people he went there,Graham Isador,https://www.thebeaverton.com/2023/04/queens-university-offers-musk-8-dollars-a-month-to-stop-telling-people-he-went-there/,"KINGSTON, ON – Queen’s University has reached out to Elon Musk offering eight dollars a month to stop telling people he attended the higher learning institution.  While the university previously championed Musk as their most celebrated alumni, the billionaire’s erratic behaviour after his recent acquisition of Twitter
 has soured that relationship.  “A few years back everyone loved Elon Musk. He was the richest person alive investing in self-driving cars and rocket ships,” said Jane Reynolds, head of student relations. “When the cars started running over people and the rockets kept exploding we didn’t bat an eye. We even stuck with him after the disastrous SNL appearance. But this Twitter blue check stuff is a step too far.”  Previously, Twitter’s blue check mark formerly confirmed the identities of notable people using the app, a system put in place after Twitter was sued for users impersonating celebrities and journalists. This week Musk eradicated Twitter’s verification system, wholly replacing it with his paid “Twitter Blue” subscription service. “He’s asking celebrities and journalists — some of the most notable people in the world, uploading content for free to his website — to pay him eight dollars a month to confirm that they’re actually who they say they are. Which doesn’t even accomplish that, because anyone can pay 8 dollars to verify as anyone else,” notes Reynolds.  “In fairness, that is the type of backward illogical business plan that you’d expect from a Western Grad, not a supposedly tech savvy entrepreneur who spent two years under the Queen’s banner.”  Queen’s university has distanced themselves from Musk, offering the equivalent cost of a Twitter Blue subscription for never mentioning Queen’s again. “Queen’s students are notoriously proud of our school. Sure the students didn’t have the grades to get into an internationally renowned school like McGill or U of T, but that still doesn’t mean they should be associated with Musk’s poor business acumen and childish antics.”  At press time Musk has not issued a statement, mainly because he was busy scouring 8chan for the funniest meme with which to publicly responded to Queen’s offer."
Budget conscious Loblaws replaces Galen Weston with new No Name president,Tristan Bradley,https://www.thebeaverton.com/2023/04/budget-conscious-loblaws-replaces-galen-weston-with-new-no-name-president/,"BRAMPTON, ON – Saying that they have been forced to make sacrifices because of the cost of living crisis, Loblaw Corporation has opted for a more budget-friendly No Name president over continuing with Galen Weston. “$11 million for a president? Just last month it was 8.4! The fuck?” stated controlling head of Loblaw’s holding company Ephram Weston III to reporters at Loblaws HQ. “That’s why instead of President’s Choice’s Galen Weston, we opted for No Name’s Retail Conglomerate President & CEO. So without further adieu, let’s get him up here.” The new faceless yellow president, speaking in an anodyne monotone, said shareholders could expect the same high level of returns for a third less than the grocery chain’s usual presidents, and as part of No Name’s Simple Check lineup, they could rest assured he was free of hydrogenated oil, monosodium glutamate, and artificial sweeteners. “We understand that things are tough for companies out there. People have the Internet,” explained the generic business leader. “That’s why in addition to a lower price, I offer straightforward yet deadpan branding that calls less attention to scandals and astonishing greed.” Sources inside the company said they originally wanted to pick up a chief executive from Rabba since it was late, but decided to hold off until the next day to save money. “Maybe one day we’ll make enough that we can afford a Weston again,” said Loblaws analyst David Frieze. “But Rogers just jacked up our phone bill and our landlord is trying to renovict us.” At press time we’ve just learned the actual new CEO’s name is Per Bank and honestly why wouldn’t it be."
"Walmart CEO claims stealing is really bad, unless it’s wages from your employees",Geoff Cork,https://www.thebeaverton.com/2023/04/walmart-ceo-claims-stealing-is-really-bad-unless-its-wages-from-your-employees/,"Portland, Oregon – Walmart CEO Doug McMillon recently stated the rise in thefts from Walmart stores is very bad, unlike the hundreds of million dollars Walmart stole from its own employees. “Several stores in lefty states have had to close due to an increase in theft,” explained McMillon. “I think we can all agree that stealing is a bad thing to do, unless you work for us and we steal your wages, don’t pay overtime correctly, or charge employees for breathing in our air.” Walmart has reported that 3 billion dollars worth of theft occurs every year, representing one percent of all their profits. Of that amount, most is due to organized thefts, but McMillon has explained that “game recognizes game.” “Organized thieves? Shit, I get it. I don’t have a problem with them, we do organized crime to our employees every day!” McMillon has defended the companies actions as not exactly theft, explaining, “They’re OUR wages, being taken by OUR employees, they belong to us!” McMillon also explained that the employees never said “no” while they withheld wages, meaning they were basically begging to get robbed.  To date, Walmart has paid out $1.6 billion in employment-related violations, which McMillon brags is only “what they’ve caught us doing so far.” “As I’ve explained to our investors, we plan to steal even more in the future,” explained McMillon. “And don’t even get me started on tax breaks. Shoot. That’s where the real game is at!” When asked what kind of stealing McMillon views as actually unethical, he explains his problem is the petty thieves who have very little and steal out of desperation. “They’ve got no style. No grace. No Tesla. Where is the artistry in a bushel of bananas hidden under a coat for someone’s hungry family?”  "
Galen Weston defends $3 million raise by asking “Have you seen how expensive stuff is getting lately?”,Jacob McArthur Mooney,https://www.thebeaverton.com/2023/04/galen-weston-defends-3-million-raise-by-asking-have-you-seen-how-expensive-stuff-is-getting-lately/,"Caledon, Ontario –Loblaws CEO Galen Weston defended his $3 million raise this week by noting that it’s really not that much when you think of how expensive things are nowadays. “Have you been to the grocery store lately?” asked the inheritor of the Weston family fortune. “They’re charging seven dollars for eggs, the bastards. This raise is barely going to cover essentials.” Mr Weston’s company has been criticized in recent months for posting record profits on growing margins while inflation has damaged Canadians’ ability to pay for food. “Just last week I went to the store,” Mr. Weston said from his estate. “I got milk, pickles, a loaf of bread, an eighteen-hole golf course on a private island, and mayo. You know what it came to? Nine million dollars. Personally I blame Trudeau.” The Loblaws Board was quick to put Mr Weston’s raise into context. “Galen and his family are worth $8.5 billion,” said board member Sheila David. “So what’s another $3 million for the service of being Canada’s most-hated man, and keeping all that attention off the rest of us? He deserves some extra walking-around money.” Mr. Weston was more circumspect. “I get the criticism, but $3 million isn’t what it used to be. Just last week I had to buy the No-Name Coffee instead of the gourmet stuff. Luckily I don’t drink it, the gardener sprinkles it on the lawn to make it grow faster. I’m not ashamed to say that.” “I work hard for my paycheque, it’s not like I got this job on luck,” said the great-grandson of company founder George Weston. “People are quick to get angry, but what should I do instead? Starve?” Mr. Weston had asked this question rhetorically but it didn’t stop everyone within earshot from shouting out “Yes!”"
