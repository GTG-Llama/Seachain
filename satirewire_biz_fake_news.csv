GOVT ADMITS IT AIMED RULE AT ONE PARTICULARLY HOT CATHOLIC NURSE,admin,https://www.satirewire.com/govt-admits-it-aimed-rule-at-one-particularly-hot-catholic-nurse/,"WASHINGTON (SatireWire.com) – The administration today backed off a requirement that religious employers provide birth control coverage after conceding the entire rule was actually written in a government attempt to hook up with a particularly hot 23-year-old Catholic nurse in Cleveland. WASHINGTON (SatireWire.com) – The administration today backed off a requirement that religious employers provide birth control coverage after conceding the entire rule was actually written in a government attempt to hook up with a particularly hot 23-year-old Catholic nurse in Cleveland. The rule called for religious organizations to include contraceptive coverage for all employees, but officials said they were mostly concerned with just the one. Identified as “Julie,” the young, single nurse works nights and every other weekend in the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit of Sacred Heart Hospital, and is described in government documents as, “a cute, cheerful brunette with big brown eyes and a smile that just, like, wow.” The rule called for religious organizations to include contraceptive coverage for all employees, but officials said they were mostly concerned with just the one. Identified as “Julie,” the young, single nurse works nights and every other weekend in the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit of Sacred Heart Hospital, and is described in government documents as, “a cute, cheerful brunette with big brown eyes and a smile that just, like, wow.” A government cost-effect analysis of the mandate estimated that providing free birth control pills to workers would lower the number of unwanted pregnancies, and providing free birth control pills to Julie would lower her objections to sex. It would also lighten her financial burden, thereby allowing her to work less and be free next Saturday night. Ideally, if things worked out, the date would conclude at her place, at which point, “Hey, you never know,” the analysis concluded.

MARKET EXPERTS ADVISE CALM. TILL NEXT TUESDAY.

After several strong years, the market was due for a “healthy correction,” said Merrill Lynch analyst Pamela Green, adding that the U.S. economy looks set to rebound by the fourth quarter, “unless next Tuesday comes first, which I’m afraid it will.” “While you must always be vigilant in market conditions such as we see today, we advise buying on dips and looking for value plays – stocks trading below their traditional book values – which we think stand a very good chance of moving upward until Tuesday, when everything goes to shit,” Green wrote in a research note to investors today. “For the risk-averse, we particularly like defensive plays, such as aerospace and health care, which we believe will hold up well prior to collapsing entirely at 10:42 a.m. Eastern Standard Time.” Unlike other life experiences, such as retirement, there is no effective way to plan for a genuine market panic, said White House chief economic advisor Lawrence Lindsey. However, he added, people can be proactive once the panic does hit. Among his suggestions: Set aside 10 percent of your pre-tax income for firearms. Invest in a thunderdome. Take “before” pictures of your town. Reconnect with family members. They may have food. Diversify your portfolio. Always sound advice, even in an Apocalypse. Eat your young. “It seems barbaric, but trust me, if you don’t do it, someone else will, and you’ll end up kicking yourself.” Will your online broker be there in a market panic?

Probably you ignore it. Well, maybe I’m getting old, but I actually agree with them. You should follow your dreams. You should pursue your goals. You should give life to your ideas, wherever they lead. As trite as it sounds, I want you to truly believe that you can be anything you want to be and do anything — absolutely anything — you want to do. Unless, that is, it competes with me.

None of this would have happened, Constitutional scholars agreed, if Apple hadn’t made “so many amazingly bad business moves” over the years. This anti-competitive, pro-Microsoft-monopoly behavior began in the 1980s, when, unlike Microsoft, Apple refused to license its operating system to other computer makers to build clones. In an even more disastrous decision, Apple licensed its software to Microsoft so it could develop applications for the Macintosh operating system.

Thursday’s incident at New York’s Waldorf-Astoria began when Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates (86 kilos) unexpectedly walked across the stage and charged AOL Time Warner’s incoming chief executive Richard Parsons (90 kilos). Gates was intercepted by Parson’s entourage, which included U.N. Secretary General Koffi Annan (68 kilos) and United Airlines Chairman Niall Fitzgerald (80 kilos). During the five-minute scuffle, Gates allegedly bit Parsons on the thigh, while World Bank President James Wolfensohn (92 kilos) suffered a bloody lip. Wolfensohn also claimed $50 million was missing from his wallet, and immediately blamed Argentine President Eduardo Duhalde (80 kilos).

The post was created 20 years ago by Balmerton founder Harold Ball, who at age of 72 began losing his teeth, among other things. “One night I lost a molar, and I was so depressed about it,” recalls Ball, now 92 and still company Chairman. “So my late wife, Mrs. Ball, told me to put it under my pillow. That night she got dressed up like a little fairy and left me a dollar. It was wonderful, and I miss her very much.

In the past 18 months, twelve employees have donned the Job Fairy costume. Two quit, six were fired, and three are still in the hospital. Former Job Fairy Edwin Marcus explains the turnover: “Look at it from an employee’s perspective. You’re sittin’ in your house, you just lost your job, and a guy in a fairy costume shows up to give you a whole dollar. And even though Mr. Ball likes to think I’m cute and all, dressed up like a happy fairy, you don’t think I’m cute, right? You want to kick my elfin ass.” “Look at it from an employee’s perspective.

You want to kick my elfin ass.” After having his nose broken three times, Marcus quit after one month. Gruleman, however, has lasted eight months, far longer than any previous Job Fairy. What’s his secret? One explanation is size. At 6-foot-2-inches and 265 pounds, Gruleman is a bread truck with a beard. And a silver tiara, blue satin sash, size 15 pumps, white taffeta dress with ovoid, paper-thin muslin wings stitched on the back, and a “wand” that looks suspiciously like a 36 oz. baseball bat with a red, sheet metal star drilled into the end. “It wasn’t red, originally,” he volunteers.

REMAINING U.S. CEOs MAKE A BREAK FOR IT,admin,https://www.satirewire.com/remaining-us-ceos-make-a-break-for-it/,"Band of Roving Chief Executives Spotted Miles from Mexican Border  “They came into my home, made me pay for my own TV, then double-booked the revenues,” said Rachel Sanchez of Las Cruces, just north of El Paso. “Right in front of my daughters.” Calling themselves the CEOnistas, the chief executives were first spotted last night along the Rio Grande River near Quemado, where they bought each of the town’s 320 residents by borrowing against pension fund gains. By late this morning, the CEOnistas had arbitrarily inflated Quemado’s population to 960, and declared a 200 percent profit for the fiscal second quarter. This morning, the outlaws bought the city of Waco, transferred its underperforming areas to a private partnership, and sent a bill to California for $4.5 billion. Law enforcement officials and disgruntled shareholders riding posse were noticeably frustrated. “First of all, they’re very hard to find because they always stand behind their numbers, and the numbers keep shifting,” said posse spokesman Dean Levitt. “And every time we yell ‘Stop in the name of the shareholders!’, they refer us to investor relations. I’ve been on the phone all damn morning.” “YOU’LL NEVER AUDIT ME ALIVE!” The pursuers said they have had some success, however, by preying on a common executive weakness. “Last night we caught about 24 of them by disguising one of our female officers as a CNBC anchor,” said U.S. Border Patrol spokesperson Janet Lewis. “It was like moths to a flame.”  Teams of agents have been using high-powered listening devices to scan the plains for telltale sounds of the CEOnistas. “Most of the time we just hear leaves rustling or cattle flicking their tails,” said Lewis, “but occasionally we’ll pick up someone saying, ‘I was totally out of the loop on that.'” Among former and current CEOs apprehended with this method were Computer Associates’ Sanjay Kumar, Adelphia’s John Rigas, Enron’s Ken Lay, Joseph Nacchio of Qwest, Joseph Berardino of Arthur Andersen, and every Global Crossing CEO since 1997. ImClone Systems’ Sam Waksal and Dennis Kozlowski of Tyco were not allowed to join the CEOnistas as they have already been indicted. So far, about 50 chief executives have been captured, including Martha Stewart, who was detained south of El Paso where she had cut through a barbed-wire fence at the Zaragosa border crossing off Highway 375. “She would have gotten away, but she was stopping motorists to ask for marzipan and food coloring so she could make edible snowman place settings, using the cut pieces of wire for the arms,” said Border Patrol officer Jennette Cushing. “We put her in cell No. 7, because the morning sun really adds texture to the stucco walls.” While some stragglers are believed to have successfully crossed into Mexico, Cushing said the bulk of the CEOnistas have holed themselves up at the Alamo. “No, not the fort, the car rental place at the airport,” she said. “They’re rotating all the tires on the minivans and accounting for each change as a sale.” Copyright © 2010, SatireWire."

ELLISON TO GRADS: DIPLOMAS ARE FOR LOSERS,admin,https://www.satirewire.com/ellison-to-grads-diplomas-are-for-losers/," Oracle CEO Urges Students to Drop out, Start up What follows is a transcript of the speech delivered by Ellison at Yale University last month: “Graduates of Yale University, I apologize if you have endured this type of prologue before, but I want you to do something for me. Please, take a good look around you. Look at the classmate on your left. Look at the classmate on your right. Now, consider this: five years from now, 10 years from now, even 30 thirty years from now, odds are the person on your left is going to be a loser. The person on your right, meanwhile, will also be a loser. And you, in the middle? What can you expect? Loser. Loserhood. Loser Cum Laude. “In fact, as I look out before me today, I don’t see a thousand hopes for a bright tomorrow. I don’t see a thousand future leaders in a thousand industries. I see a thousand losers. “You’re upset. That’s understandable. After all, how can I, Lawrence ‘Larry’ Ellison, college dropout, have the audacity to spout such heresy to the graduating class of one of the nation’s most prestigious institutions? I’ll tell you why. Because I, Lawrence “Larry” Ellison, second richest man on the planet, am a college dropout, and you are not. “Because Bill Gates, richest man on the planet — for now, anyway — is a college dropout, and you are not. “Because Paul Allen, the third richest man on the planet, dropped out of college, and you did not. “And for good measure, because Michael Dell, No. 9 on the list and moving up fast, is a college dropout, and you, yet again, are not. “Hmm… you’re very upset. That’s understandable. So let me stroke your egos for a moment by pointing out, quite sincerely, that your diplomas were not attained in vain. Most of you, I imagine, have spent four to five years here, and in many ways what you’ve learned and endured will serve you well in the years ahead. You’ve established good work habits. You’ve established a network of people that will help you down the road. And you’ve established what will be lifelong relationships with the word ‘therapy.’ All that of is good. For in truth, you will need that network. You will need those strong work habits. You will need that therapy. “You will need them because you didn’t drop out, and so you will never be among the richest people in the world. Oh sure, you may, perhaps, work your way up to No. 10 or No. 11, like Steve Ballmer. But then, I don’t have to tell you who he really works for, do I? And for the record, he dropped out of grad school. Bit of a late bloomer. “Finally, I realize that many of you, and hopefully by now most of you, are wondering, ‘Is there anything I can do? Is there any hope for me at all?’ Actually, no. It’s too late. You’ve absorbed too much, think you know too much. You’re not 19 anymore. You have a built-in cap, and I’m not referring to the mortar boards on your heads. “Hmm… you’re really very upset. That’s understandable. So perhaps this would be a good time to bring up the silver lining. Not for you, Class of ’00. You are a write-off, so I’ll let you slink off to your pathetic $200,000-a-year jobs, where your checks will be signed by former classmates who dropped out two years ago. “Instead, I want to give hope to any underclassmen here today. I say to you, and I can’t stress this enough: leave. Pack your things and your ideas and don’t come back. Drop out. Start up. “For I can tell you that a cap and gown will keep you down just as suredly as these security guards dragging me off this stage are keeping me dow…” Copyright © 2000-2009, SatireWire."

AMD, however, refused to allow reporters into its facilities to verify the claim. “We would, but we can’t reach the doorknobs to let you in,” spokesman Ravi Chalani said in a phone interview. AMD’s assertion comes a day after Intel boasted it will soon pack 400 million tiny transistors on a chip running at 10GHz. The Sunnyvale-based AMD has made no such chip claim, but insisted employee size directly relates to chip size. “It’s just common sense that smaller employees will eventually translate into ever smaller chips,” said Chalani, noting that smaller employees have smaller hands and are also naturally predisposed to “think small.” Meanwhile, AMD chief executive Jerry Sanders has been working with a miniaturization coach and can now only be found with an electron microscope, Chalani added.

In the past 18 months, twelve employees have donned the Job Fairy costume. Two quit, six were fired, and three are still in the hospital. Former Job Fairy Edwin Marcus explains the turnover: “Look at it from an employee’s perspective. You’re sittin’ in your house, you just lost your job, and a guy in a fairy costume shows up to give you a whole dollar. And even though Mr. Ball likes to think I’m cute and all, dressed up like a happy fairy, you don’t think I’m cute, right? You want to kick my elfin ass.” “Look at it from an employee’s perspective.

What’s his secret? One explanation is size. At 6-foot-2-inches and 265 pounds, Gruleman is a bread truck with a beard. And a silver tiara, blue satin sash, size 15 pumps, white taffeta dress with ovoid, paper-thin muslin wings stitched on the back, and a “wand” that looks suspiciously like a 36 oz. baseball bat with a red, sheet metal star drilled into the end. “It wasn’t red, originally,” he volunteers.

STUDY FINDS YOU REALLY DON'T MAKE A DIFFERENCE,admin,https://www.satirewire.com/study-finds-you-really-dont-make-a-difference/," In Grand Scheme of Things, Your Hard Work, Diligence, Found to Mean Squat “In our research, we found that you’ve been encouraged to believe that your hard work and contributions are substantial, and that you are a significant member of the team. But what we discovered is that in your particular case, there’s no way,” said Neil Romsby of the London School of Economics. In the study, jointly conducted by the LSE and Stanford University’s Business School, researchers interviewed your superiors and colleagues, and uncovered a variety of slogans meant to boost your sense of worth, such as “Our employees are our greatest asset,” and, “Our value is in our employees.” “We’re not necessarily saying these platitudes are all lies,” said Stanford economics professor Harold Bloom. “We’re just saying they have nothing to do with you.” “That may seem sad,” Bloom noted, “but it’s actually rather funny because your situation is quite obvious to everyone else.” Romsby added that it’s also ironic. “When you tell your boss he is doing a good job, you know you are lying, but when your boss tells you the same thing, you actually believe it. That’s priceless.” Romsby cautions you, however, not to assume you are simply a meaningless number to your company. “No, that’s not a fair analogy,” he said, “because numbers are actually quite meaningful to your company. Unlike you.” In another finding, researchers also learned that contrary to your company’s public relations claims, your company is not really “creating the future” or “improving people’s lives.” This, Romsby explained, is actually good news for you. “By failing to make a difference at a place that also doesn’t make a difference, at least you’re not really hurting anybody,” he said.
