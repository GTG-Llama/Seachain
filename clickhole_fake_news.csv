Dad’s Not Gonna Like This: Mom Just Got Sucked Out Of The Plane Window,N/A,https://clickhole.com/dads-not-gonna-like-this-mom-just-got-sucked-out-of-the-plane-window/,"Our long-awaited family vacation is off to a rocky start, and Dad’s liable to blow a gasket when he finds out why: Mom just got sucked out of the plane window. Christ, Mom. We talked about how important this trip was to Dad! Dad’s been looking forward to our big Boston adventure for months now, but naturally, right when our flight got within spitting distance of Logan International, Mom went and leaned on a structural defect in the plane window that triggered an explosive decompression and slurped her clear out into the troposphere. She probably could have stayed inside the aircraft if she’d had her seatbelt buckled, but you know how fidgety Mom gets. She just had to undo it so she could “be comfy” and do that weird crossed-legged thing she does on planes. Well, now she’s in uncontrolled freefall toward earth’s surface, the cabin’s totally depressurized, and Dad’s gonna flip his wig as soon as he gets back from the lavatory and learns what happened. So thanks for that, Mom! Hope “being comfy” was worth it. Dad’s got a short fuse in the best of times, but his temper is gonna go supernova once he finds out Mom managed to autodefenestrate at 35,000 feet. We’re not looking forward to telling him that the weird, loud noise he heard from the bathroom—like the sound of somebody sucking a noodle through a straw, if the noodle could shriek—was actually his own wife throwing a big impact crater-shaped wrench into his vacation plans. We just know he’s going to make a scene, shouting out the window after her about how she better land on something soft because we have tickets for the Boston Harbor Sunset Cruise tonight and he’s sure as shit not spending the whole time on the phone with their life insurance. And jeez, he’ll be especially livid when he realizes that despite not being able to grab hold of an armrest or the window itself on her way out, Mom somehow managed to maintain an iron grip on the iPad he lent her so she could watch Outlander. So now he’s down a wife and an iPad, since Mom’s inevitable collision with the ground definitely won’t be under warranty. Sometimes we think Mom’s actually trying to drive Dad insane with all the bullshit she pulls. While we’re definitely not happy about Mom hurtling toward the earth at terminal velocity or anything, we’re hoping that the experience of flipping violently through the air like some kind of human pinwheel might at least make Mom consider booking an aisle seat next time we fly somewhere, assuming she lives. Things between her and Dad might actually improve in the long run if she takes getting sucked out the plane window as a kind of teachable moment. But given that the pilot just announced we’re making an emergency landing in fucking Hartford, Connecticut of all places, Mom’s got a long road ahead before Dad forgives her for blowing up the week full of clam chowder and Paul Revere shit he’d been planning for so long. Alright, the lavatory’s “Occupied” light just went out, so wish us luck breaking it to Pop that his Boston dreams are now a total wash. That’s classic Mom for you—get sucked out of the plane window, and leave everybody else to deal with the consequences!"
"Beautiful: When This Teacher Noticed One Of His Students Never Had Anything To Eat At Lunch, He Let Her Eat Their Class’s Pet Hamster",N/A,https://clickhole.com/beautiful-when-this-teacher-noticed-one-of-his-students-never-had-anything-to-eat-at-lunch-he-let-her-eat-their-classs-pet-hamster/,"Teaching is one of the most underappreciated professions out there. Don’t believe us? You will after reading this absolutely beautiful story out of Bentonville, Arkansas: When this teacher noticed one of his students never had anything to eat at lunch, he let her eat their class’s pet hamster. Ugh, if you’re not crying right now you literally don’t have a heart! Gerald Heisey, a fourth grade teacher at McGinn Elementary, noticed while on lunch duty this month that his student Lila DeMarsico regularly went without food, leaving her fatigued and distracted during lessons. That’s when Heisey stepped in to do something amazing: Earlier this week, he asked Lila to wait after class and offered her Geronimo, the class’s pet hamster, as a snack. While Heisey was aware that it went against school policy for teachers to feed students hamsters due to allergy concerns, he knew he had made the right decision when he watched Lila excitedly devour Geronimo alive before running out to recess full of energy.  Now, Heisey spends his own money at PetSmart each week to keep a new hamster on hand for Lila, or for or any student not getting the nutrition they need to make it through a full day of school. No matter what their home situation or financial difficulties may be, Mr. Heisey’s students know they can go to him before or after school and be handed a protein-packed hamster, no questions asked.  It’s official: this man is Teacher Of The Year! It doesn’t get more beautiful than seeing a teacher go out of their way to feed a large rodent to a student in need. If every school had a teacher like Heisey, the world would be a better place!"
It’s Officially Halloween! Frankenstein Is Chasing Grandma Around The House,N/A,https://clickhole.com/its-officially-halloween-frankenstein-is-chasing-grandma-around-the-house/,"Put on your costumes and get ready to go trick-or-treating, because the spookiest day of the year is finally here. Frankenstein is chasing Grandma around the house, which means that Halloween has officially arrived! There’s no mistaking it now: It’s definitely time for some frightful celebrations! October 31st might have officially started at midnight, but Halloween itself did not officially begin until 8:30 a.m. when Frankenstein broke down the door of Grandma’s bedroom closet from inside and started pursuing her from room to room. The sound of Grandma screaming and knocking over lamps and chairs to slow Frankenstein down as she fled from him was a clear signal to everyone that All Hallows Eve was upon us. Everyone can finally start up their favorite horror movies and sit down on the couch with a big bowl of candy, because Frankenstein is clomping down the hallway with his arms stretched out in front of him while Grandma keeps screaming for someone to call animal control so they can shoot Frankenstein with a tranquilizer dart. Frankenstein is probably chasing Grandma because he wants to either kill her or marry her! We’ve been looking forward to Halloween all month long, and as the houses around the neighborhood started decorating their porches with fake spiderwebs, inflatable skeletons, and jack-o-lanterns, you could really feel the anticipation in the air. And now that Frankenstein is chasing Grandma in endless circles around the kitchen table, it’s safe to say that the big night is finally here. Happy Halloween, everyone!"
"A Hidden Dark Side: After Her Father’s Death, This Woman Discovered A Bunch Of Really Negative Reviews He Had Written Of Pretty Well-Regarded Vacuum Cleaners",N/A,https://clickhole.com/a-hidden-dark-side-after-her-fathers-death-this-woman-discovered-a-bunch-of-really-negative-reviews-he-had-written-of-pretty-well-regarded-vacuum-cleaners/,"If you’re easily disturbed, you might want to think twice before reading this incredibly fucked-up story about a family member with a double life: After her father’s death, this woman discovered a bunch of really negative reviews he had written of pretty well-regarded vacuum cleaners.  Jesus. No one wants to learn a dark secret like this about a parent after they pass away.  When 43-year-old arborist Rachel Altman’s father, Bill, died, she set about sorting through his belongings with the uncomfortable knowledge that she might discover something she hadn’t been aware of, like a secret stash of pornography or a handgun she never knew he had. But nothing could have prepared Rachel for what she found on Bill’s laptop—on his Amazon account, alongside numerous five-star ratings for items like pens and belts, were dozens of needlessly harsh reviews of otherwise-beloved vacuum cleaners with headings such as “PIPING Hot Garbage” and “Worse Than A Broom.” We can hardly fathom the shock Rachel must have felt when she found out about the intense animosity her father harbored towards perfectly good vacuums. Bill’s one-star review of the Dyson Cyclone V10 Animal Cordless Vacuum Cleaner, which has a 4.6 star overall rating, began with the headline, “Barely A Vacuum” and went on to claim, “The Dyson Cyclone V10 turns what should be a quick, efficient touch-up cleaning into a laborious, exhausting process that makes one wonder whether licking the floors clean would be preferable to using this clump of literal human shit. Sure, no one expects primary vac power from a stick vacuum, but the poor ergonomics, tiny dirt receptacle, and flimsy build quality suggests that the clowns over at Dyson might be better off developing toy vacuums for toddlers. At the end of the day, though, I’d expect more from Fisher Price.” And Bill’s review for the 4.5-star Shark NV360 Navigator Lift-Away Deluxe Upright Vacuum with Large Dust Cup Capacity, HEPA Filter, Swivel Steering, Upholstery Tool & Crevice Tool is even more brutal. The review repeatedly refers to the vacuum simply as “shithead” or “this shithead” and claims “This shithead went in the trash before I even used it. If I could give in negative 100 stars, I would.” Further reviews of a variety of vacuums ranging from handheld vacs to high-end industrial models fit the same mold—Bill invariably described these products using phrases like “BEYOND useless” and “made me hurl,” and repeatedly warned readers against buying them unless they wanted to experience “the vacuum equivalent of Hell on earth.” Devastating. Imagine finding out something like this about someone you loved and trusted.  It must be so hard for Rachel to cope with the fact that her dad was a man who was so overly harsh to vacuum cleaners that other reviewers frequently praised for being easy to empty, quick to charge, and generally well worth the price. Now, not only must she cope with her father’s death, but she also has to learn to accept that he wasn’t the man she thought she knew. It’s going to take years of therapy to come to grips with this, if that’s even possible. Our thoughts are with her during this difficult time."
Diminutive Executioners Rejoice! Execution Warehouse Is Now Selling An Executioner’s Hood For Petite Executioners,N/A,https://clickhole.com/diminutive-executioners-rejoice-execution-warehouse-is-now-selling-an-executioners-hood-for-petite-executioners/,"If you’re a tiny little executioner who doesn’t fit the cookie-cutter mold of a 7-foot-10-inch brute with chest hair as thick as spaghetti sprouting from his veiny pecs, you’re going to love this: Execution Warehouse is now selling an executioner’s hood for petite executioners.  So. Much. Yes! Finally, an acknowledgement that beheading criminals with a double-headed ax in the town square in front of throngs of cheering onlookers isn’t a one-size-fits-all gig.  For centuries, itty-bitty executioners, some no larger than housecats, have been forced to wear massive hoods made for linebacker-size hangmen because the execution industry was stuck in the Middle Ages. These smaller executioners often had to modify their thick studded leather hoods or risk the eye holes not lining up with their eyes—a hazard which would regularly cause executioners to miss a target’s neck, instead chopping off the top of a criminal’s head or burying the ax into their back. These moments would invariably result in an embarrassing chorus of boos from the bloodthirsty commoners gathered at the beheading block, not to mention a major hit to the executioner’s reputation. Well, all of that has changed now that Execution Warehouse has added petite sizes to their line of executioner hoods, which were formerly only available in XXXL. Now, wee little executioners won’t have to look unprofessional wearing a hood that practically covers their entire body when they lead their victims to the guillotine or gallows to execute them for practicing witchcraft or failing to bow to the King. Children, women, and real small little guys will now all be able to find a hood at Execution Warehouse that fits their needs as an executioner. It’s about time. Petite executioners, today is your day! Executing is a career for everyone, not just bear-sized men, and finally the execution industry is putting that dated stereotype to bed. While they certainly took their sweet time stepping into the 21st century, Execution Warehouse has done the right thing here. We’re guessing they’re going to sell a boatload of these things, and we are so here for it! Now let’s get out there and lop off some heads in styyyyyle!"
Nostalgia FTW: These Inmates Are Being Transferred To A Maximum Security Prison On MTV’s ‘Next’ Bus,N/A,https://clickhole.com/nostalgia-ftw-these-inmates-are-being-transferred-to-a-maximum-security-prison-on-mtvs-next-bus/,"If you grew up in the mid-2000s, get ready to feel incredibly jealous of these violent prisoners who are being treated to the throwback to end all throwbacks: These inmates are being transferred to a maximum security prison on MTV’s Next bus. Talk about a blast from the past! How cool is it to see what the Next bus is being used for today?! Currently, the iconic bus from MTV’s hit reality dating show Next is transporting 14 of the luckiest high-risk convicts in the world to the maximum security unit of Pelican Bay State Prison in Crescent City, California. If speaking weren’t strictly forbidden throughout this prison transfer, you can bet that every millennial inmate on board would be reminiscing with about watching Next after school back in the day. There is no doubt that when these guys step off the bus at their new correctional facility, they’ll be imagining themselves in a Next-style freeze-frame with an inset graphic listing what crime they’re in prison for and a couple fun facts about themselves. The only way this could get any cooler would be if the Pelican Bay prison guard in charge of the transfer then said “Next!” and sent them back onto the bus instead of locking them away in one of the scariest penitentiaries in the country! Welp, it’s officially 2007 all over again at Pelican Bay State Prison! Wow. For a few hours, these lucky prisoners can take life sentences and death row off their minds and just think about MTV’s Next. If anyone could use a nostalgic treat like this, it’s men who are preparing to remain behind bars for decades on end with a bonafide Suicide Squad of real-life rapists, pedophiles, and murderers as their new neighbors. So awesome!"
Nature Is Beautiful: This Stupid Little Bird Probably Has Some Dumb Name Like Violet Cockass Or Billow-Throated Goochtail Or Something,N/A,https://clickhole.com/nature-is-beautiful-this-stupid-little-bird-probably-has-some-dumb-name-like-violet-cockass-or-billow-throated-goochtail-or-something/,"The wonders of the natural world are without number, and something truly magnificent has reminded us just how beautiful this Earth can be: This stupid little bird probably has some dumb name like Violet Cockass or Billow-Throated Goochtail or something. We are truly blessed to share our planet with such marvelous creatures. We’re feeling deeply awestruck right now, because the little dumbass hanging out on this tree branch almost certainly possesses an idiotic name like the Thrusting Oafjay or the Crested Bukkake or whatever. This feathery dipshit is the product of millions of years of complex natural processes, and we’re lucky enough to stand here at the culmination of that evolutionary journey and go, “Oh shit, it’s a fuckin’ Applebottomed Beeshitter,” or something to that effect. It could have just been named something normal like a Northeastern Wood Sparrow or a Gray Wren, but thankfully some completely pudding-brained 1800s guy probably saw one and went, “Nope, I’m calling this a Yellow-Footed Hogsucker instead,” because everybody was lead-poisoned to shit around the time bird naming really took off and probably believed some wildly off-base stuff about these birds parasitizing hogs. It’s so incredible that a birdwatcher could see this shitty little bird and go, “Wow, that’s a Tufted Percocet,” and then a second birdwatcher could come up and say, “Actually, the stripes along the wing mean it’s a Rimmed Honky.” And maybe a third birdwatcher—who even has some kind of degree in knowing what all these birds’ deranged names are—could tell them they’re both wrong, and in fact that particular dumb bird is a rare Dickmann’s Nut Swallow. Then they could stand around saying how exciting it is to see a Dickmann’s Nut Swallow this far north, how it’s usually just Hairy Nut Swallows around here, but changing migratory patterns could bring more Dickmann’s and perhaps even Creampied Nut Swallows if recent stupid little bird scholarship is to be believed. That kind of splendor really takes your breath away. It breaks our heart to think that climate change and habitat destruction might rob future generations of the chance to see this type of Piping Chumbawamba or Slammed Applebee’s or whatever for themselves. These creatures are truly extraordinary, and we owe it to our grandchildren to protect this tiny idiot, and indeed, all stupid birds with dumb names like Warbling Blumpkin and Titboobed Sudeikis and other stuff that’s somehow even dumber than that. Wow, this natural encounter has really moved us. Here’s hoping these stupid little birds and their utterly moronic names are with us for many years to come!"
"Oh Boy, Here We Go: This Man Just Opened A 9-Paragraph Post With ‘While I Find Violence In All Of Its Forms To Be Abhorrent…’",N/A,https://clickhole.com/oh-boy-here-we-go-this-man-just-opened-a-9-paragraph-post-with-while-i-find-violence-in-all-of-its-forms-to-be-abhorrent/,"Hoo boy! Well, here we fucking go: This man just opened a nine-paragraph post with, “While I find violence in all of its forms to be abhorrent…” Yikes, yikes, yikes. Just 12 words in and we already know that thing is not headed anywhere good. Twenty-four-year-old Seattle-based graphic designer Michael Creeks cross-posted his nine-paragraph screed on Instagram, Facebook, and X, so you know it was super important for him to get whatever eye-roll-inducing bullshit he’s about to spew out to as many of his combined 312 followers as possible—but based on the simultaneously self-righteous and mealy mouthed way he’s started his message, we can’t imagine that any of those followers are going to glean much from it. It’s obvious from the first few words that the take Michael’s getting ready to spray all over the toilet that is the modern internet will not be remotely helpful: Is Michael going to express that he believes Israel has a right to self defense against terrorism while also praying for the safety of civilians in Gaza? Is he going to attempt to justify Hamas’ violence against civilians, women, and children as valid asymmetrical warfare against a much more militarily powerful foe? Is he going to make everyone who follows him all the dumber for having read his post with blatantly obvious statements like, “More killing is never the answer”? Will he claim that he’s trying to break down all of the complexities and nuances of the situation for us so we can educate ourselves and become better global citizens in between all the thirst traps and meme accounts in our feeds? Who knows! But, based on his opening sentence, plus the fact that he’s never once discussed the Israel/Palestine situation publicly or privately in his life, we can safely guess that in the nine paragraphs that follow, Michael will attempt to use whatever nuggets of expertise he’s been able to glean from a few days casually Googling “israel gaza” and “hamas history” to bolster an armchair case for whatever the fuck a guy who plays guitar in a Joy Division cover band called “Shadowplay” thinks needs to happen in the Middle East. Oh, goody! After that doozy of an intro, there’s no doubt that in the next few sentences we’ll be finding out how Michael felt he couldn’t remain silent any longer, or possibly even how he didn’t feel like he could sit on the sidelines watching the horrors in Gaza unfold without speaking his piece. Then, we’ll likely be hearing about his Jewish friends (both of whom are secular and have no connection to Israel), his Muslim friends (who actually amount to one guy he sat next to in grade school), and how his heart is heavy for them (despite him not reaching out to any of them personally). Heck, there might even be a donation link for an aid organization which he hasn’t actually donated to himself! Buckle the FUCK up! Because if Michael’s first paragraph is any indication of what’s to come, a volcano of wet, stinking garbage is about to explode all over our feeds. Had Michael’s opening sentence been just a teensy bit different, maybe we could be more optimistic that he was simply going to post about his own personal feelings of sadness and anxiety caused by the violence unfolding in the Middle East and offer a message of love, but nope, it looks like it’s going to be all about him attempting to out-rhetoric the rest of his social media feed while people on the other side of the world perish. So, everyone, get ready to scroll past as quickly as you can, because Michael has something to say!"
Autumn Trend Report: Millions Of Young Adults Are Forgiving Their Parents For Their Failures And Accepting Responsibility For Their Own Lives,N/A,https://clickhole.com/autumn-trend-report-millions-of-young-adults-are-forgiving-their-parents-for-their-failures-and-accepting-responsibility-for-their-own-lives/,"Move over pumpkin spice lattes—there’s a new trend that’s sweeping the nation that you’re definitely going to want in on. This fall, millions of young adults are forgiving their parents for their failures and accepting responsibility for their own lives.  Count us in!! If you’re looking to stay on trend this autumn, you can ditch the cable knit sweater and knee-high boots, because the only thing you need this season is the inner peace that comes with knowing that your parents might’ve made mistakes, but they really were doing the best they could. This popular new realization has young adults all over the country forgiving their parents and taking control of their futures—a trend that some forecasters predict is here to stay! While it might not be easy to get to the point where you truly understand how resenting your parents only hinders your own healing journey, it’s pretty much a must if you want to keep up with what’s hot this fall. Seriously, anyone who’s anyone is spending the next couple of months forging their own path and letting go of the feelings of blame they harbor toward the people who determined their childhood circumstances. OMG—this totally seems worth a try! So this month, you can skip the pumpkin patch—unless of course you’ve decided to invite your parents there so that you can work on strengthening your relationship with them, allowing them get to know you as a real person instead of as an extension of themselves. Rather than spending your time carving jack-o-lanterns or lighting scented candles, try recognizing how your hyper-fixation with who’s at fault for your current situation is preventing us from living the life you want. It won’t be long before you notice some of your favorite influencers and celebrities devoting their October and November to doing the same! Okay, this definitely seems like an awesome trend for fall! Sound off in the comments if you’ll be forgiving your parents ASAP!"
Deeply Troubling: New Projections Suggest That Climate Change Could Continue Well Into Next Year,N/A,https://clickhole.com/deeply-troubling-new-projections-suggest-that-climate-change-could-continue-well-into-next-year/,"We hate to be the bearers of bad news, but some discouraging research has us worried that an ongoing crisis will be with us for much, much longer than we’d like: New projections suggest that climate change could continue well into next year. Ugh, we were really hoping the earth’s mounting uninhabitability would have reversed course by then. The catastrophic fires, flooding, and other weather extremes resulting from human use of fossil fuels have already more than overstayed their welcome, but according to an ominous study released by Stanford University today, there may be a very real chance we won’t see a return to normal climate conditions until the back half of 2024. This certainly isn’t the news anyone wanted to hear—we’re all anxious for atmospheric CO2 concentrations to get back to pre-industrial levels ASAP, and the prospect of another several months getting battered by city-deleting storm systems and choking on toxic plumes of orange haze is daunting to say the least. But however much we’d like to just put the consequences of unchecked greenhouse gas emissions behind us and get on with life, the climate has other plans, and new research suggests that we’re probably going to have to grit our teeth and power through a couple more mass die-offs of marine life and region-destabilizing crop failures before we’re safely on the other side of this thing. “It’s definitely going to be at least another grim winter feeling the ravages of record-setting weather aberrations, and potentially spring and summer too, if we’re unlucky,” said Dr. Clement Stackel, the lead researcher behind the projections, adding that he’d privately advised relatives to hold off on visiting coastal regions, forests, or the American Southwest until the cascading disasters of anthropogenic global warming have largely cleared up. “I think a lot of people feel exhausted, like ‘I’ve sweat through 80 degree nights, I’ve seen fish rotting in stagnant puddles that were once deep lakes, I’ve held my child’s hand in helpless terror during their smoke-induced asthma attacks—I’m ready for this climate change thing to be done now.’ And I get that! I am too. But if the data say climate change might stick around for another year, we have to make peace with that possibility and not throw out those wildfire evacuation go-bags just yet.” So much for getting back to pre-industrial temperature averages in time for Christmas. As dismaying as this news is, it makes you appreciate just how good it’s going to feel when we finally reach the finish line with climate change and can ease back into our old routines of planting water-intensive crops in the middle of vast deserts and pursuing infinite economic growth at all costs. Sure, it’ll take another couple years for sea ice to fully bounce back, and another couple years after that to recover the biodiversity we lost, but someday soon all this social and ecological collapse will be nothing but a bad memory. It just might take a little longer to get there than we thought. Well, another year of climate change would definitely suck, but sometimes you’ve got to play the hand you’re dealt. Here’s hoping these projections end up being wrong and a return to normalcy is just around the corner!"
Kind Of A Wash For Inclusivity: ‘Sesame Street’ Just Introduced And Then Immediately Killed Off It’s First Pagan Puppet,N/A,https://clickhole.com/kind-of-a-wash-for-inclusivity-sesame-street-just-introduced-and-then-immediately-killed-off-its-first-pagan-puppet/,"Over the years, Sesame Street has proven itself to be a bastion of inclusivity, introducing a wide range of new characters representing a broad spectrum of different backgrounds and identities. However, the show’s most recent new cast member isn’t necessarily their biggest success on this front: Sesame Street just introduced and then immediately killed off its first pagan puppet. All in all, this one is kind of a wash for inclusivity. The new character, an orange monster with blue pigtails named Hypatia, made her first and only appearance on last week’s episode of Sesame Street. In the episode, several Sesame Street regulars, including Big Bird, Oscar the Grouch, Bert and Ernie, and Grover are all walking to Mass when they see Hypatia kneeling at a shrine to Ceres, Goddess of Agriculture. Grover says, “Who are you and why does your statue of Christ the Lord look so bizarre?” and Hypatia replies, “I’m Hypatia, and this isn’t Christ, it’s Ceres, one of many deities whom I worship since I’m a pagan.” Big Bird looks at her for a few moments before saying, “I’m not crazy about that.” Over the course of the episode, Hypatia teaches her new friends all about her pagan culture. She helps Bert and Ernie sacrifice an ox to Jupiter and then sings a song about how you can read the future by examining its entrails. Later on, she and the Count get together to count up to 17, which is the number of times per year Hypatia says she must pour libations to the sea god Neptune in order to avoid his wrath.  Things seem to be going relatively well for the new pagan monster until Oscar the Grouch asks her point-blank what church she goes to and she says, “I don’t go to church, because I’m a pagan.” When Hypatia says this, Ernie screams at the top of his lungs and starts ripping his hair out, and Grover throws up. Big Bird yells, “She is a heretic!” and the Sesame Street regulars tie Hypatia to a stake and set it on fire. The episode concludes with Elmo and Cookie Monster standing over Hypatia’s ashes and reciting the Lord’s Prayer in Latin together while Cookie Monster sweeps the ashes into a shoebox labeled “Bound For Hell.” At the end of the day, Hypatia’s storyline was one step forward and one step backward as far as religious tolerance on Sesame Street is concerned. Here’s hoping the next time the show introduces a new character with a different cultural viewpoint than the rest, they can survive for more than just one episode!"

We Hate To Say It: The Vibes At This Book Burning Are Incredible,N/A,https://clickhole.com/we-hate-to-say-it-the-vibes-at-this-book-burning-are-incredible/,"When we first heard about a gathering in Gladeville, Tennessee where residents were burning books they deemed “liberal propaganda” and/or “of the occult,” we assumed it was a regressive celebration of ignorance. Well, we’re sorry to say it, but that couldn’t be further from the truth: The vibes at this book burning are absolutely incredible.  We went in expecting to wag a finger at this whole demonstration, and now we’re asking “When’s the next one?!” Look, we don’t know what to tell you. It turns out that the fact that someone voted to ban Harry Potter, Twilight, and Toni Morrison novels from schools in the name of protecting children from Devil worship and the Woke Agenda doesn’t necessarily mean they aren’t a great hang! Out here in the clearing where the book burning is taking place, everyone is just glad to be together, happily sharing alcohol and food out of the back of their pickup trucks and taking turns dumping memoirs about gender identity into the crackling fire—if you weren’t privy to the reactionary, anti-intellectual context of this town’s bonfire gathering, you’d be totally enchanted by the sense of community. Literally, we told this one guy we didn’t agree with what they were doing, and he said “Well, do you agree with this, Satanist cocksucker?” and handed us a bowl of this crazy delicious venison chili he made himself. Even offered us the damn recipe. The dude was as hospitable as a guy wearing a camouflage Punisher shirt and open-carrying an assault rifle could possibly be.  Look, we don’t support burning books, it’s just that…everyone here is so, so chill.  Tough to be outraged around this kind of positive energy! Did we get a little carried away with the feel-good vibes and throw a copy of Chelsea Clinton’s She Persisted into the fire ourselves? Maybe. But we’re just saying, this particular book burning is THE event to be at tonight, and if you’re unwilling to put your virtues aside for one second to come hang, it’s your loss. "
Can We Separate The Art From The Artist?: This Man Just Bonked Someone On The Head With The Beautiful Painting He Made,N/A,https://clickhole.com/can-we-separate-the-art-from-the-artist-this-man-just-bonked-someone-on-the-head-with-the-beautiful-painting-he-made/,"It’s an age-old debate—can we appreciate incredible art even if its creator has committed despicable acts? This recent story brings that moral quandary into stark relief: This man just bonked someone on the head with the beautiful painting he made. Wow. We must say, it’s difficult to extricate the visionary who created such an incredible work of art with the lunatic who used it to bean someone. You would not be alone in admiring the deft brushstrokes and pleasing color balance displayed in the floral still life recently completed by Providence, Rhode Island-based artist Paul Morgan, but any enjoyment you might find in his work is complicated by the fact that as soon as he finished it, Paul rushed out of his studio and onto the street with its canvas in hand and used it to smack an unsuspecting bystander across the head. It’s tough to square the fact that the same man who dreamed up this arresting bouquet of flowers also screamed “Nighty-night, asshole” as he lifted the painting above a stranger’s head and then brought it down with all his might, but that is simply the case here. And so the question presents itself: Can we even call this painting beautiful knowing that its creator used it as an instrument of bonking? His art is incredible, but his behavior is unconscionable. Can you blame us for not knowing what to do here? It would be easy to sit back and feast our eyes on Paul Morgan’s lovely impressionist work, but to do so without acknowledging his bonking-based violence would erase this terrible act, not to mention the experience of his victim, who ran around clutching his head in a daze for several minutes after the attack. Frankly, we are at a loss. What do you think? Can we enjoy this painting, knowing that its artist socked someone with it? Let us know your opinion in the comments!"
AI’s Threat To Writers: A Smart Fridge Has Been Hired Onto The Writing Staff Of ‘Abbott Elementary’,N/A,https://clickhole.com/ais-threat-to-writers-a-smart-fridge-has-been-hired-onto-the-writing-staff-of-abbott-elementary/,"If you thought the warnings about AI taking over the creative arts were overblown, this disturbing story will absolutely make you think again: A smart fridge has been hired onto the writing staff of Abbott Elementary. Yikes. Is this the beginning of the end for screenwriting as a profession? Earlier this morning, ABC announced that the first ever Samsung 4-Door Flex™ smart refrigerator with active WGA membership status is joining the writers’ room for the next season of beloved mockumentary sitcom Abbott Elementary. Sources within Abbott’s production office say writers only learned of the Samsung fridge’s hiring when they arrived at work and found it placed on top of a chair in the writers’ room. By the time the staff reported to their daily meeting, the fridge was already generating scripts on its touchscreen display at a rate of 50 scripts per minute, all of which featured storylines centered around groceries, food expiration dates, and the amount of milk remaining in Abbott Elementary’s teacher lounge. Dismissing staff objections to the fridge’s hiring, executive producers for the show insisted Abbott’s human writers either respect and include their new creative collaborator or be fired for discrimination. According to ABC, the smart fridge experienced several hiccups during its first day on staff, largely due to an error in its coding that made it think Abbott Elementary was set inside a refrigerator rather than a public school in Philadelphia. The fridge’s programming also had to be altered to reflect typical writers’ room behavior. For example: to indicate laughter at a fellow staffer’s joke idea, the fridge dispenses ice onto the floor. Further, to argue against another writers’ story idea, the smart fridge automatically places an Instacart order for a single mushroom. Wow. Is this the future of Hollywood? Only time will tell if Abbott Elementary’s human staff members can compete with a Bluetooth-enabled refrigerator, but either way, it looks like artificial intelligence’s threat to creative professionals is real, and escalating quickly!"
Absolutely Beautiful: This Woman Just Shared Four Completely Contradictory Text Posts About Israel/Palestine Followed By A Photo Of A Soup She Made,N/A,https://clickhole.com/absolutely-beautiful-this-woman-just-shared-four-completely-contradictory-text-posts-about-israel-palestine-followed-by-a-photo-of-a-soup-she-made/,"The horrific violence taking place in the Middle East this week has been incredibly difficult for Westerners to comprehend, let alone respond to. But one amazing soul from Arlington, VA has managed to speak out in a way that will surely resonate with everyone concerned about this global tragedy: This woman just shared four completely contradictory text posts about Israel/Palestine followed by a photo of a soup she made. Just beautiful. Twenty-eight-year-old project manager Kara Marshall was deeply concerned to hear about the continued attacks taking place in Israel and Palestine this week, but thankfully, she did not allow her despair to stop her from using her Instagram story as a platform to educate and inspire those around her: Within the span of thirty minutes, Kara managed to share a somber text post about how all violence is wrong, a second text post decrying the evils of Israel’s colonialism, a third text post referring to Hamas as a brutal terrorist organization, a fourth text post about media literacy, and finally, an image of white beans simmering in her enameled Dutch oven with a festive GIF reading “fall vibes.” It is truly amazing to see how Kara has taken on this issue in her own powerful, compassionate, and highly self-contradictory way, sourcing her posts from accounts ranging from her favorite ’90s sitcom actors to liberal arts school campus organizations to a hypnosis influencer who goes by the name of TheMindfulMelissa—not to mention her very own iPhone photos, which have allowed her to share tantalizing step-by-step photos of her nourishing plant-based stew. By sharing words from all these important voices, Kara is letting her followers know in no uncertain terms that she is an empowered, informed, soup-eating citizen who thinks that war is bad, children are the future, justified violence is always necessary, and religion is both highly destructive and absolutely amazing—and we are so here for it. This is such an inspiration. We hope that everyone on Instagam gets a chance to see what Kara posted, because it’s giving us a whole new perspective on war, as well as on bean soup. Well done, Kara. Well done."
"Incredible Deal! For Just $7, Kevin Durant Will Smell Your Semen And Tell You Whether Your Future Sons Will Grow Up To Be Basketball Players",N/A,https://clickhole.com/incredible-deal-for-just-7-kevin-durant-will-smell-your-semen-and-tell-you-whether-your-future-sons-will-grow-up-to-be-basketball-players/,"If you love basketball, enjoy saving money on deals, are a man, and want to have a kid one day, you’re going to want to read up on this amazing opportunity: For just $7, Kevin Durant will smell your semen and tell you whether your future sons will grow up to be basketball players. So much yes!! The Phoenix Suns star took to Instagram this week to announce the most incredible deal ever. As stated in an IG reel, Kevin Durant has the ability to predict whether your future kid is going to be a basketball player, and he only needs to sniff your semen for three seconds to figure it out. “I’ve had this power all my life and I thought I could finally start making some money off it, but I want it to be low-cost and accessible to all, so I thought $7 was a good price,” explained the power forward. “I can’t tell if your kid will be good at basketball or bad at it, but I can tell with over 153 percent accuracy whether they will play it.” “If I sniff your semen and it smells like nothing, your kid will be a basketball player. If your semen smells like pavement then they won’t,” said Kevin Durant, adding, “Don’t waste time trying to smell your own semen. You’re not going to figure it out. You need Kevin Durant’s help.” Durant’s Instagram story linked to a website with details about the exciting new offer: If you’re interested, all you need to do is fill out an Asana form with your address, ejaculate into a cup, and leave the cup on your stoop. Within six months, Kevin Durant will show up at your house, smell the semen, and leave behind a notecard that either says “BASKETBALL PLAYER” or “NOPE.” So cool! With so many unknowns facing prospective parents, this sounds like a pretty epic way to at least answer whether or not your son will play basketball. Sound off below if you’ll be taking advantage of this super cool new deal."
Breaking The Cycle Of Toxic Masculinity: This Dad Cries In Front Of His Son At Least 5 Times A Day,N/A,https://clickhole.com/breaking-the-cycle-of-toxic-masculinity-this-dad-cries-in-front-of-his-son-at-least-5-times-a-day/,"Toxic masculinity is a real problem in society today, with many men caught in a cycle of violence and emotional repression as a result. Fortunately, some men like the one in this story have found a way to reject this harmful norm and embrace their feelings: This dad cries in front of his son at least five times a day. Amazing! What an awesome example he’s setting for his boy! A classic tenet of toxic masculinity is the myth that “real men don’t cry,” but in a powerful rejection of the norms around how a man should act, 45-year-old Dan Yucca of Bloomington, IN spends countless hours sobbing in front of his son Jacob every single day. It doesn’t matter if they’re at home, in the middle of the department store, or even at one of Jacob’s baseball games—Dan isn’t afraid to say “take that, patriarchy” and cower down in the fetal position while banging his fists on the floor and chanting “I just don’t know how much more I can take.” YES!!! THIS is what masculinity looks like! Some kids go their whole lives without their dad opening up about how they feel inside, but for lucky Jacob, every family dinner features an hour-long monologue about how Dan isn’t sure whether a loser like him even deserves to have a happy life given all the pathetic failures he’s gone through on the personal, professional, and familial levels. It’s safe to say that Jacob is pretty much the luckiest kid ever—he’s never once overheard his dad yelling at his mom, and instead regularly hears his dad screaming at his own reflection in the mirror, openly and honestly berating himself for his subpar looks and weak personality. Now this is a man who isn’t afraid to embrace his vulnerable side!! This is so heartwarming. It must be so awesome to grow up with this example of what masculinity could look like. If all dads were this unafraid to show how they really feel, the world would definitely be a better place."
Must’ve Done Disgusting Things To Get Where He Did: This One Fish Is Way Bigger Than All The Others In The Koi Pond,N/A,https://clickhole.com/mustve-done-disgusting-things-to-get-where-he-did-this-one-fish-is-way-bigger-than-all-the-others-in-the-koi-pond/,"Some people’s success is just too exaggerated for anyone to believe they came by it honestly, and we can only imagine the carnage that one hotshot must have left in his wake as he ruthlessly clawed his way to the top: This one fish is way bigger than all the others in the koi pond. There’s just no way a koi achieves that kind of size differential without giving up a piece of his soul. The ornamental carp of this koi pond nearly all measure somewhere between four and eight inches long, and in a just, equitable water feature, that would likely be the end of the story. But the jarring presence of a single, damn near toddler-sized Sanke koi lumbering his way through the water suggests that stomach-churning acts of piscine depravity are far from uncommon beneath this koi pond’s tranquil surface. We could chalk it up to dumb luck if this koi had just an extra inch or two on his peers, but you don’t wind up a full 70% bigger than the next largest fish without pulling some absolutely vile shit along the way. There’s clearly no moral line this behemoth wouldn’t cross to hoover up as many nutrients as possible, and that shameless self-interest could hardly be more obvious if his distinctive markings spelled out “HERE COMES A FUCKING SOCIOPATH” on one side and “WILL COMMIT ATROCITIES FOR FOOD” on the other. We’ll never know all the unseemly details of this lunker’s rise to bigness, but written in his almost football-like girth are a thousand unspoken tales of grotesque, insatiate greed. Has he muscled an elderly Kōhaku koi out of the way to gobble up the weaker fish’s dinner? Almost certainly. Has he gleefully concussed fellow koi while jostling to the front of the pack when a visitor comes by to scatter fish food? Without a doubt. Has this fucker, in his utter contempt for any and all other life forms, methodically consumed any juvenile koi unlucky enough to fit within the limits of his endlessly gulping maw, cannibalizing even his own offspring in an orgiastic frenzy of self-gratification and spite? Of course he has. Look at him. Look at how goddamn big he is. He’s probably eaten every kid he’s ever had. A fish like this belongs in a prison cell, not a koi pond. This big chunky koi may live the good life for now, but karma’s a motherfucker, and someday his cutthroat feeding habits are going to catch up to him. Someday, a raccoon’s gonna come around this koi pond looking for a feast, and all that ill-gotten bulk will mark this koi out as the tastiest morsel in the bunch. And as the raccoon’s teeth tear into his flesh, ripping the life from his body bite by agonizing bite, maybe then he’ll finally realize that all those betrayals along his path to largeness—all those fellow koi he so callously offered up at the altar of personal gain—were just links in a chain of his own making that bound him inescapably to this fate. It makes us sick imagining all the underhanded bullshit this koi must have pulled to get this huge. Here’s hoping the day of this monster’s comeuppance is right around the corner!"
"A Loss For The Left: This Woman Cut All Her Racist Family Members Out Of Her Life, But None Of Them Noticed Or Cared",N/A,https://clickhole.com/a-loss-for-the-left-this-woman-cut-all-her-racist-family-members-out-of-her-life-but-none-of-them-noticed-or-cared/,"During the political turmoil of the past decade, many liberals have suggested that members of their ranks ought to cut ties with any loved ones whose social and political opinions are simply too abhorrent to bear. But that tactic seems to have failed in one recent case: This woman cut her racist family members out of her life, but none of them noticed or cared. Oops. This is a major L for the left. Macy Prescott, of Tuscaloosa, Alabama, decided last year that she was finished hearing her extended family members use racist dogwhistles about welfare and immigration to spread hateful rhetoric against people not like themselves, and she chose to take a stand by ceasing contact with several uncles, aunts, and cousins. This would have been an incredibly brave move, but unfortunately, not a single one of these family members has noticed that Macy had failed to call them on their birthdays or show up to their annual family barbecue, or even realized that she was upset with them on any level. In fact, one cousin reported that the family believed Macy had been missing from recent get-togethers because she “had some sort of job in Europe or something.” Macy was trying to make a good point, but unfortunately, it didn’t quite get across. Macy hoped that by refraining from sending her normal “Happy anniversary” Facebook message to her Uncle Ralph and Aunt Lisa this year, they would realize that they had lost out on an important relationship due to their retrograde beliefs. Unfortunately, though, her Uncle Ralph has only continued posting links to news articles decrying school districts that teach about slavery in history class, one of which he even tagged Macy in, apparently not realizing that they had become estranged. It took a lot for Macy to make the decision to cut contact with her aunt and uncle, but it looks like it will take even more effort to get them to notice what’s occurred. How unfortunate. As hard as Macy tried to cut these people out of her lives as a punishment for their upsetting beliefs, she has not managed to succeed. Let’s hope she gets through to them one of these days!"
"You Do You, Queen: Grandma Just Used The Litter Box",N/A,https://clickhole.com/you-do-you-queen-grandma-just-used-the-litter-box/,"When you reach a certain age, you’ve just gotta throw caution to the wind and do your own thing. Here’s the perfect example of someone who’s been on this planet for long enough that they refuse to live on anyone’s terms besides their own: Grandma just used the litter box.  Go OFF, Queen! You do you.  Grandma decided to fully live in the moment and just go for it this weekend when the entire family gathered for a barbecue. Without requesting permission or making any apologies, she pushed her way through the crowded kitchen, entered the mud room, hovered over the litter box, dropped trou, and went both number one and number two like she’d done it thousands of times before. She then buried her entire mess in Tidy Cats with a few quick swipes of her foot and headed back into the kitchen to finish the citrus salad she was whipping up as if nothing had happened.  While Grandma’s beeline to use the litter box certainly raised a few eyebrows, we’re totally gonna let this one slide. This woman raised six kids in a farmhouse without plumbing and had two brothers who were killed in World War II. If she wants to go pee and poo the way a cat does, she can have at it.  Love ya, Grams! If this is your thing, then this is our thing.  Life is precious, and who knows how long Grandma has left on this planet. Who are we to tell a woman who’s survived cancer twice and lost an eye getting kicked by a horse where she can or can’t piss and shit? If using the litter box makes her happy, we aren’t going to rob her of that in her twilight years. We don’t have to love everything our aging relatives do, but we have to respect it. Grandma, you’ve earned the right to shit in a plastic tub on the floor in front of everyone you know and then some. "
Bro: This Cabbage Is Straight-Up Staring At Me Tryna Start Shit,N/A,https://clickhole.com/bro-this-cabbage-is-straight-up-staring-at-me-tryna-start-shit/,"There’s some serious, serious bullshit afoot, so just a heads up that things might get ugly in a minute, because this cabbage is straight-up staring at me tryna start shit. Bro…I really think this cabbage wants to catch these hands. I really, really do. You see the way he’s looking at me, right? You see this shit? For the past, like, four hours, this cabbage has been posting up on my kitchen counter, eyeing me down, acting all hard as if I won’t get up off my couch and dust his little ass into coleslaw without any hesitation whatsoever. Like, bro, I bring this Savoy boy into my house, and he pulls this staring shit? I cannot let that slide. I cannot. I will slice, dice, and pickle his sorry green ass into kimchi, and they will never be able to put him back together again. When someone disrespects you the way this cabbage is disrespecting me right now, you have to do something about it, or else every other vegetable on your counter’s gonna think you’re a punk. That’s just the way it is. Know what? I bet he’s only playing Mr. Tough Cabbage because I got my girl with me right now. Yeah. That’s it. She’s with me, she looks good, and this cabbage thinks he’s gonna show off, get her attention by tryna get in my head or something. But what that cabbage doesn’t know is that my girl is loyal. She’s intellectual. She’s a reader. She’s a grown-ass W-O-M-A-N, and that shit won’t play with her. She stopped messing around with little cabbages a long, long time ago, especially the insecure ones that put on that macho front bullshit. For real, that jealous shit is just sad, bro. It really is. This cabbage needs to grow the fuck up. Like, I almost feel bad for him, because the only chance he’ll ever have at getting my girl’s attention will be when I pair his ass with some corned beef tonight—my girl’s favorite. Mhm. In our relationship, it’s St. Patrick’s Day every damn night. Mhm. My girl be moaning “Sláinte!” when she’s with me, son. Anyway… Look, if that cabbage wants some of this? I will give him all of this. No problem. No mercy. All he needs to do is say something, instead of just staring (like a pussy). I’ll be here waiting."
Heartbreaking: This Man Has No Idea He’s The Guy His Friends Think Of In Order To Remember Their Lives Could Always Be Worse (WITH READER DISCUSSION GUIDE),N/A,https://clickhole.com/heartbreaking-this-man-has-no-idea-hes-the-guy-his-friends-think-of-in-order-to-remember-their-lives-could-always-be-worse-with-reader-discussion-guide/,"After reading the article, stick around for a reader discussion guide to help you tease out themes and concepts from the story with your family, friends, or study group! Brace yourself, because this upcoming story about a very pathetic guy might the most gut-wrenching thing you hear all week: This man has no idea he’s the guy his friends think of in order to remember their lives could always be worse. Just heartbreaking. Although 35-year-old Dylan Ottery’s life isn’t outright horrible, it’s also not one most people would want. Bad luck seems to follow him everywhere he goes, like how he seemingly picks up bedbugs on every business trip even when no one else does, or how at this point, he’s had at least four different variants of Covid. Still, though, Dylan shows up to every social gathering and fearlessly regales his friend group with a story about whatever bad thing happened to him that week without realizing that every subsequent detail he reveals only serves to make everyone feel better about themselves, solely because they’re glad that they’re not him. Dylan has no idea that the reason his friends call him when they go through a breakup isn’t because he gives great advice, but because they know that no matter how many times they’ve been rejected, Dylan will always have been rejected more. And he’s totally oblivious to the fact that the reason his friends confide in him about their financial issues isn’t because he’s an empathetic listener, but because his constant stream of job losses and debt will never fail to remind them just how good it is not being Dylan. God. It’s seriously so sad that this guy is out here living his life with no idea that his friends are all cheering themselves up by thinking, “Hey, it could be worse. I could be Dylan.” This is just awful. While on the one hand it speaks to Dylan’s unbreakable resilience that he is able to remain both positive about his lot in life and clueless to the fact that everyone around him has it way better, it’s pretty tragic that his friends are only able to snap out of their own depressive spirals by thinking of how great it is that they’re not him. What a bummer. Is there anyone in your life who you think of in order to feel better about yourself? If so, why? It’s said that “comparison is the thief of joy,” yet in this instance, comparison is the giver of joy. Is comparison always a bad thing? Do you identify with Dylan, or with the people in his life? If so, why? Why do you think Dylan remains unaware of this situation? Is the tendency to compare ourselves to others in order to feel better analogous to the old adage, “there are starving people in Africa”? Is your own life better or worse than Dylan’s? If so, why? In today’s world of memes and video content, what is the role of prose-based satirical comedy? "
Amazing! Spirit Airlines Has Announced An Even Cheaper Flight Tier Where You Have To Be The Wing Of The Plane,N/A,https://clickhole.com/amazing-spirit-airlines-has-announced-an-even-cheaper-flight-tier-where-you-have-to-be-the-wing-of-the-plane/,"Get ready to save some serious money on airfare, because an already cheap airline is letting passengers pitch in a bit of work in exchange for way lower prices: Spirit Airlines has announced an even cheaper flight tier where you have to be the wing of the plane. Whoa, this sounds like an incredible deal for travelers on a budget! Spirit Airlines has consistently offered some of the most inexpensive flights in the industry, and now they’ve managed to take their dedication to consumer value one step further by introducing a new Wing Class service level for customers willing to spend the flight’s duration outside the fuselage generating lift. In exchange for linking arms and supporting flight-critical equipment in the same way as a traditional wing, roughly a dozen passengers on each side on the plane will be able to fly to their destination for just 60% of the cost of flying Economy. Of course they’ll be sacrificing some amenities like in-flight entertainment and pressurized air, but those potential drawbacks are counterbalanced by perks like incredible views and a deplaning process as quick and easy as simply letting go. Wing Class passengers will have varying responsibilities depending on which part of the wing they represent. Those at the very tip of the wing will use their free hands to repeatedly flash a white light to help prevent collisions with other aircraft, as well as to shine either a red or green light to indicate the plane’s orientation. Three passengers in the middle of the wing will wear special harnesses that support the plane’s powerful jet engines and will be tasked with verbally shooing away any birds in danger of flying into them. And all passengers acting as the wing will be expected to kick their legs up or down depending on the pilot’s instructions to assist in controlling the plane’s overall direction and altitude. If you’ve got limited funds and good upper body strength, this could be the travel option for you. “Traditional wings cost airlines millions to construct and maintain, and those costs are typically passed onto the customer, but we at Spirit are excited to share the savings we generate by forgoing them entirely with the help of some aerodynamic fliers,” said Spirit CEO Ted Christie, noting that for safety purposes, all Wing Class passengers will be required before takeoff to verbally confirm to a crew member that they feel capable of forming an essential component of the plane’s rigid outer structure for the duration of the flight. “Parents flying Wing Class will still be allowed to duct tape a child under three to their back without having to buy them an additional ticket, and flying above the clouds means a great opportunity to work on that tan before you even hit the beach. So to anyone looking for a no-frills flight that will get you there without breaking the bank, we say: Be the wing you wish to see on the plane.” Damn, that’s quite the bargain Spirit’s offering here. Kudos to them for finding such an ingenious way to keep their tickets affordable!"
You Can Get Paid For That?! This Man Earns A Full-Time Salary And Benefits Just For Putting Down Dogs!,N/A,https://clickhole.com/you-can-get-paid-for-that-this-man-earns-a-full-time-salary-and-benefits-just-for-putting-down-dogs/,"A job that’s well paid, easy, and fun? Get ready for what might just be the best-kept secret in the entire job market: This man earns a full-time salary and benefits just for putting down dogs! Yup, you read that right. No catch. You can literally get paid to do this! Meet Keith Bell, 38, a Sioux City, IA-based veterinary technician who earns $42,000 a year just to euthanize dogs! For the simple act of injecting sick or elderly dogs with a lethal dose of sodium pentobarbital, Keith’s office can charge pet owners upwards of $300 per procedure—and that’s not counting the $100-150 they get for cremating the dog afterwards (yup, Keith gets to cremate them too!). That’s right, Keith makes a living at something a lot of people would enjoy doing in their own free time as a hobby. Plus, the perks are awesome: Sometimes he even gets to put down other kinds of animals too, like cats, birds, iguanas, and hamsters. His days at the office probably sound like a vacation compared to most people’s 9-to-5! If you’re thinking, “Whoa, getting paid to put down dogs sounds too good to be true…but I hate working in an office,” you’re in luck: Apparently, you can do what Keith does, but as an animal control officer, meaning you can spend work days in the sun chasing down stray dogs, loading them into a van, and euthanizing them even when they’re young and mostly healthy. It’s almost like you’re getting paid to go fishing! And get this: There’s no college degree required. All you need is a high school diploma and the will to put dogs down. That’s it!  Um, be right back, we’re gonna go apply for this guy’s job right now. Wow. Here’s Keith, getting a full-time salary just for euthanizing dogs, while the rest of us chumps sit bored out of our minds at desk jobs. What’s even more incredible is that some people get paid to do this same procedure on humans and death row inmates too, and the pay’s even better. Talk about easy money…where do we sign up?!"
"Ah, Jesus Fuckin’ Christ: The Dog Caught A Hobbit",N/A,https://clickhole.com/ah-jesus-fuckin-christ-the-dog-caught-a-hobbit/,"Welp, looks like our relaxing mid-morning stroll has taken a turn for the fucking horrifying, because our normally well-behaved pet just went psycho on a helpless little creature: The dog caught a hobbit. Fuck us, man, what a mess. We really didn’t need this shit today! We were out taking our dog Mango around the park on his regular daily walk, same as we’ve done a thousand goddamn times before without incident, and somehow in the two fucking minutes we gave him to drop a deuce behind the bushes he managed to find, catch, and thrash the ever-loving shit out of a poor little hobbit. We got him to drop it pretty quick but Christ, fuckin’ Mango really did a number on the thing: The hobbit’s guts are hanging out of its torn-up little waistcoat, its spine is bent back at a truly sickening angle, and there’s a big hairy foot lying on its own off in the grass. Worst of all, after all that abuse the hobbit’s still not dead somehow. It’s just pitifully dragging its limp lower half around making this awful high-pitched gasping sound. Ugh, it looks so confused and afraid. God fuckin’ dammit, Mango. This goober’s dumbassed prey drive just added at least another hour of bullshit to our morning. For one thing, we’ve gotta go to the damn vet to make sure Mango didn’t eat any pipe-weed or mathoms or phials of the light of Eärendil’s star the hobbit might have been carrying, not to mention give him a bath to get out all the blood and puked-up second breakfast he rolled around in like a freaky fuckin’ jackass. And then, God help us, there’s still the hobbit. We can’t just leave it here to suffer, but it’s probably too far gone for the vet, if they even do hobbits. The elves of Ithilien could heal it, maybe. But oof, that’s like a 40 mile drive from here, and we really don’t feel like getting hobbit blood all over the back of our new fuckin’ Honda Odyssey. Nothing for it but to put the little sucker out of its misery, we guess. Don’t see any rocks or branches big enough to do it. We could just stomp on its head really hard? Ugh, no, that’s too much for us. Maybe… maybe we can just snap its neck. Yeah, that’s quick, and almost sort of dignified. Okay, here goes. Sorry little guy, we’re just gonna come in nice and easy and SHIT, OW! THE FUCKIN’ HOBBIT BIT US! Motherfucker, now we’ve gotta get a fuckin’ rabies series on top of all this other shit. Thank God the park is empty, because we yelled pretty loud and the last thing we need right now is some horrified jogger siccing all of TikTok on us like losing sight of our dog for two minutes makes us fuckin’ Saruman. Look, we know how important hobbits are for ridding the ecosystem of great evils through their gentle stoutness of heart—this shit was Mango’s idea, not ours! We’ve hit the brakes for damn near a hundred little Tooks and Proudfeet over the years, most people just paste ‘em without a second thought. Hell, the only harm we ever did to a hobbit was accidentally pulp one with the lawnmower once, and that was instantaneous. It felt nothing. So maybe we’ve banked enough karma to just leave this little guy and let people think a Nazgûl got it, or at the very least hit the vet and ER first and come back later to finish it off with a fuckin’ shovel. Boy, some fucking walk this turned out to be. Hope Mango’s fuckin’ proud of himself, because his dumb hobbit-chomping ass just ruined our whole goddamn day!"
User Experience Win: Airbnb Has Added A Special Rating Category For When Your Host Was Well-Meaning But Inept,N/A,https://clickhole.com/user-experience-win-airbnb-has-added-a-special-rating-category-for-when-your-host-was-well-meaning-but-inept/,"Many Airbnb guests know how difficult it can be to rate an Airbnb when your stay was overall quite bad but the host was incredibly kind. Fortunately, the company has stepped up with an epic solution: Airbnb has added a special rating category for when your host was well-meaning but totally inept. Awesome! This is such a game-changer. Starting this week, Airbnb users will be able to opt out of giving their polite yet clueless host a negative review by selecting the new “Host Meant Well But Was Deeply Inept” rating category. Now, instead of leaving a brutally honest write-ip in that details how the host was a sweet elderly man who was extremely responsive but unfortunately had no toilet paper or working lights in his home, you can simply select from a few pre-written descriptions such as “Really Interesting Anecdotes But No Locks On The Doors,” “All Pipes Leaking But Host Refunded A Lot Of Money For It,” and “A Bad Review Might Break This Host.” This way, you’ll be able to let other renters know what they’re in for without lowering the host’s rating, which would be mean. So much yes! “Perhaps this has happened to you: your Airbnb host drops by each morning of your stay with fresh linens, but at the same time, the home has no running water, and when you asked about it, the host began to cry, explaining how the only reason they started running an Airbnb in the first place was because of a life-altering car accident that forced them out of the job they’d loved for 40 years,” explained Airbnb in their press statement. “In these situations, it’s basically impossible to give an honest review, but guests often feel that they’re doing a disservice to future renters without giving them a heads-up about the nightmare they’ll be walking into. With our new feature, we hope to remedy this conundrum.” Airbnbs that receive “Host Meant Well But Was Deeply Inept” ratings will be denoted by an emoji of an old man shrugging helplessly beside the Airbnb’s star count, so that users know before booking that just because the home has 4.5 stars doesn’t mean it won’t also have some severe, undisclosed problem. Whatever that problem is, though, the host will likely try to remedy the issue with a batch fresh-baked cookies, which will be a really nice gesture, but will also probably taste horrible. This is so cool! Here’s hoping VRBO follows suit, because this will seriously do wonders for customer satisfaction by letting guests know in advance when they’re in for a very bad trip with a very nice host. "
"Stevie Nicks And CNN, Ranked",N/A,https://clickhole.com/stevie-nicks-and-cnn-ranked/,"It’s an age-old question: Rock n’ Roll Hall of Famer Stevie Nicks…or the news channel CNN? Today, we’re settling the debate once and for all: Here is the definitive ranking of Stevie Nicks and CNN. 2. Stevie Nicks Coming in dead last is former Fleetwood Mac frontwoman Stevie Nicks. While there’s no denying Nicks’ talent as a songwriter and vocalist, she unfortunately falls short of the mark when it comes to broadcasting current events programming to millions of people around the clock. Her specialty lies in penning rock anthems, and…well, that’s pretty much it. If you’re depending on Stevie Nicks for 24/7 news coverage, election infographics, and Wolf Blitzer, you are completely out of luck. Of course, “Landslide” and “Edge Of Seventeen” are bonafide classics—but they aren’t earning any News & Documentary Emmy awards for Outstanding Live Interview, and Stevie Nicks would probably be the first to admit that. Until Stevie Nicks proves she can bring the same ratings as Jake Tapper does in the 4-5 p.m. EST news slot, she’s likely to rank last whenever it comes to her and CNN. 1. CNN And at the very top of our ranking is…none other than CNN! The Ted Turner-founded multinational news outlet boasts millions of viewers in 212 countries, as well as Dana Bash. Not only does CNN offer music during the intros and outros of their news segments, but they also have minute-to-minute election coverage presented by John King. With Stevie Nicks…you’re only getting one of those. In fact, with Stevie Nicks? You’re only getting Stevie Nicks, whereas CNN offers CNN Brazil, CNN Chile, CNN Türk, and more. Though it’s certainly no knock on her artistic talent, the complete non-existence of a Stevie Nicks Brazil channel does demonstrate her comparable lack of reach in global news markets. And here’s the real kicker: CNN has dozens of articles about Stevie Nicks, giving you the best of both worlds. Enjoy Stevie Nicks’ music all you want, just know that she hasn’t written a single lyric about the week’s top stories in U.S. politics or firing Don Lemon. Yes, you can say that CNN has never been featured on VH1 before, but you absolutely cannot say Stevie Nicks is The Most Trusted Name In News, and that’s not up for debate. We’re fans of both, but ultimately, CNN beats Stevie Nicks any day of the week. Yup, we said what we said, and if you disagree, you’re simply wrong!"
"Even From The Great Beyond, Our Ancestors Watch Over Us: This Man’s Dead Grandma Just Appeared In His Google Doc",N/A,https://clickhole.com/even-from-the-great-beyond-our-ancestors-watch-over-us-this-mans-dead-grandma-just-appeared-in-his-google-doc/,"Take comfort in the knowledge that we are never truly alone, because an unexpected encounter is proving that the spirits of those who have passed from this earth may yet offer us their guidance in times of need: This man’s dead grandma just appeared in his Google Doc. Wow. How wonderful to know that the departed are still looking out for us from the hereafter! Earlier today, 24-year old Sean McKean felt truly stuck revising his cover letter for an important job application, his dream of managing the social media presence of a small nutritional supplement startup called CocoNourishment slipping further and further from reach. But just when things seemed completely hopeless, he suddenly felt the warmth of a benevolent, strangely familiar presence with him in the Google Doc: There, in the upper right hand corner of his screen, was an icon indicating that his grandmother Doris McKean was somehow now viewing the document, even though she wasn’t shared on it and had passed away from a stroke back in 2018. So powerful are the transcendent bonds of ancestry that neither the document’s privacy settings nor even death itself could stop her from appearing from beyond the grave to help shape Sean’s draft into a compelling pitch to a prospective future employer. Doris’s spectral purple cursor has spent the last several minutes flitting all over Sean’s Google Doc, highlighting passages of flat, repetitive prose and using the comment feature to suggest punchier alternatives that emphasize Sean’s experience being a team player from four years of college lacrosse. Already, she’s caught two subject-verb agreement issues, an incorrect use of a semicolon, and no fewer than three capitalizations of the name CocoNourishment that do not match the particular style used in official CocoNourishment copy. Can science explain how Doris is using the Google Doc’s chat window to spitball strong closing sentences that demonstrate Sean’s eagerness to drive positive online engagement with the CocoNourishment brand? No, perhaps not. But when one considers the great love our ancestors must feel as they watch us make our way in the world they left behind for us, such a thing makes perfect sense. What a beautiful testament to the bonds of kinship! While Sean was understandably startled at first, typing things like “GRANDMA? HOW CAN THIS BE?” and “I WATCHED THEM BURY YOU,” he’s calmed down since realizing that her lingering spirit only wishes to help him keep that cover letter short, sweet, and on-message. And though Doris’s cursor will no doubt fade back into nothingness once she’s finished the last of her edits to the Google Doc, Sean will remember the strength of her undying love any time he cashes one of the fat CocoNourishment paychecks this cover letter is about to land him. It’s nice to know that someone is always looking out for us. Here’s hoping that our own forebears will appear in our Google Docs whenever we need their wisdom!"
No Need To Worry: Mitch McConnell Has Revealed That Whenever He Freezes Up His Mind Is Journeying To The Astral Plane Where Thomas Jefferson Teaches Him How To Be A Better Senator,N/A,https://clickhole.com/no-need-to-worry-mitch-mcconnell-has-revealed-that-whenever-he-freezes-up-his-mind-is-journeying-to-the-astral-plane-where-thomas-jefferson-teaches-him-how-to-be-a-better-senator/,"Over the past few weeks, members of the Senate and the American public have expressed concern over Senator Mitch McConnell’s health and ability to govern after the senator experienced multiple episodes during which he froze in public and stopped speaking mid-sentence. Fortunately, it turns out all of the speculation about Senator McConnell’s health was just a false alarm: Mitch McConnell has revealed that whenever he freezes up his mind is journeying to the astral plane where Thomas Jefferson teaches him how to be a better senator. What a relief! Turns out there’s no need to worry about Mitch McConnell’s health in any way! “Whenever you see me freezing up in the middle of a speech, that’s just my consciousness traveling to Thomas Jefferson’s Government School, where the spirit of our great Founding Father Thomas Jefferson teaches me how to be the best senator I can possibly be,” McConnell said in a press conference delivered on Capitol Hill earlier this morning. “Any time I appear to zone out and lose the ability to speak for several seconds, I am actually experiencing 10,000 years worth of time in the astral plane, during which I am learning vital governance lessons about things like the Bill of Rights and how to tie a tie.” Well, it’s official: Everyone who was questioning whether Mitch McConnell was fit to serve owes the senator an apology! According to Senator McConnell, Thomas Jefferon’s Government School exists in a small brick schoolhouse built in an endless forest of trees made of crystal. It is located in a realm that the fae folk who inhabit those woods call “The Kingdom Of Education And Pain.” McConnell stated in the press conference that every time his mind is transported there, Thomas Jefferson takes his hand and they recite the Declaration of Independence together. They then spend the rest of McConnell’s time in that dimension going over important senatorial lessons like how to veto a bill and how to eat your lunch on the Senate Floor quietly enough that nobody yells at you. As if that weren’t amazing enough, McConnell says that Thomas Jefferson isn’t the only great American whose spirit he sees when his mind is transported to the Kingdom Of Education And Pain. “At Thomas Jefferson’s Government School, Benjamin Franklin is the custodian, and he chases me through the hallways with his mop yelling out the names of all the vice presidents in chronological order,” McConnell said during his press conference. “If he catches me, he bites me. Also, John Hancock is the swim teacher there and he has helped me learn to dive.” This is great news! It sounds like Senator McConnell is in perfect health and more fit to serve in the Senate than ever! It’s wonderful to know that every time it looks like he’s having some sort of serious brain episode, he’s actually sending his mind through the farthest reaches of time and space in order to take senator lessons from the specter of Thomas Jefferson. If he keeps traveling to a higher dimension to attend Thomas Jeferson’s Government School, then he just might become the greatest senator of all time!"
Fascinating: New Archaeological Evidence Has Revealed That Neanderthals And Early Homo Sapiens Had Sort Of A Mario And Luigi Thing Going On,N/A,https://clickhole.com/fascinating-new-archaeological-evidence-has-revealed-that-neanderthals-and-early-homo-sapiens-had-sort-of-a-mario-and-luigi-thing-going-on/,"Much of humanity’s primitive past remains shrouded in mystery, but a game-changing discovery is helping researchers piece together how our ancestors and another group of archaic humans once interacted: New archaeological evidence has revealed that Neanderthals and early Homo sapiens had sort of a Mario and Luigi thing going on. Wow! It seems Nintendo has been telling a much older story than anyone ever realized. Anthropologists have known for some time that early modern humans existed alongside Neanderthals until the latter’s extinction some 40,000 years ago, but excavation of a shared settlement located in what is modern-day Bavaria has led experts to believe that the pair of ancient hominids had a dynamic quite like that of the Mushroom Kingdom’s iconic plumber duo. The shorter, stouter Neanderthals seem to have primarily worn reddish animal pelts and exhibited a plucky willingness to battle the fearsome megafauna of the age, while the taller, thinner Homo sapiens wore identically shaped garments adorned with green leaves and came off as bashful, timid goofballs. Intriguingly, this color scheme seems to have been a key point of differentiation between the species, with the discovery of various artifacts in reds and greens—including caps bearing either a big ‘N’ or ‘H.S.’ insignia, respectively—strongly suggesting that the overall Middle Paleolithic situation was about as Mario and Luigi as it gets. It’s astonishing how much this one excavation site can tell us about the whole Mario and Luigi-style deal our ancestors had. Micro-fractures in leg and foot bones found there paint a vivid picture of Homo sapiens and Neanderthals running and jumping all over the hills, shouting “Yippee!” as they stomped on turtles and forcefully bounced off their shells to reach higher ground. The charismatic species apparently took on all sorts of Marioesque challenges together: returning lost baby penguins to their mothers, using Homo sapiens’ floatier jumps to cross large chasms in subterranean grottos, and smashing big blocks of flint into rudimentary stone tools, though it remains a contentious point of debate whether those blocks were smashed by punching or by headbutting. And while it appears that the hominids were generally cooperative, sharing foraged mushrooms and unleashing powerful tag-team attacks against mammoths, nearby cave paintings suggest that they nevertheless engaged in fierce competition during times of party games or tennis. We kind of wish Homo sapiens were the Marios of the pair, but this is still incredibly cool. “Though we still don’t know exactly what it was that made Neanderthals go extinct, these findings raise the possibility that the last 40,000 years are essentially a Luigi’s Mansion-type deal where the cowardly Homo sapiens get to break out of the sidekick role and take the spotlight in their own adventure,” said anthropologist Jason Weindling, adding that the glaciation of the Late Pleistocene was basically just an ice level like Snowman’s Land or Freezy Flake Galaxy when you think about it. “These discoveries also challenge previous beliefs that Neanderthals were more of a Wario figure to Homo sapiens’ Mario, which were rooted in misguided Victorian-era assumptions that Neanderthals were evil and went “WAHHH” all the time. And while Australopithecines predated the Mario and Luigi dynamic seen here by millions of years, this information supports current theories that those kooky little guys were pretty much Toad.” Just amazing. It’s nice to know that our ancestors had a vaguely Mario Bros kind of situation going on with Neanderthals. Kudos to these researchers for giving us such a fascinating window into humanity’s past!"
This Team Can’t Catch A Break: The New York Jets Just Got Trapped In The Same Thai Cave All Those Soccer Players Had To Be Rescued From In 2018,N/A,https://clickhole.com/this-team-cant-catch-a-break-the-new-york-jets-just-got-trapped-in-the-same-thai-cave-all-those-soccer-players-had-to-be-rescued-from-in-2018/,"All the hope that New York Jets fans had for this year vanished within minutes of Aaron Rodgers’ first game as their new quarterback, when he left the field with a season-ending injury. Now, as if that weren’t reason enough to doubt the Jets’ playoff chances, things just got much more dire for the team: The New York Jets are currently trapped in the same Thai cave all those soccer players had to be rescued from in 2018. Oof…this is truly a nightmare scenario for Jets fans. In a press conference this morning, Head Coach Robert Saleh announced that the Jets’ entire 53-man roster is presently stuck 2.5 miles deep inside Tham Luang Nang Non—the same north Thailand cave system a youth soccer team was famously rescued from several years ago. Saleh personally took responsibility for his players getting stranded deep inside the cave as the result of a “team-building activity gone wrong,” but was confident that the team could all be rescued and back on the field within 14-20 days. Needless to say, with the cave’s oxygen levels depleting and water levels rising, this new hurdle doesn’t bode well for the Jets’ showdown against the New England Patriots this upcoming Sunday. “Our guys are tough, they can overcome anything the cave throws at them, so for now, we’re just taking it day by day, and not making any calls before we’re able to establish communication with them. Rescuers are running a telephone wire through the cave as I speak,” Saleh continued, assuring fans that star players like Sauce Gardner and Garrett Wilson were being attended to by the best cave divers the Jets’ organization has to offer. “You know, going into this season, we knew there were going to be challenges, and getting 53 large athletes in full gear out of an underwater cave system, through extremely narrow passages, in almost total darkness, that’s definitely become one of them, and hey, we just have to deal with it. We’re fighters. Anyone writing us off because of losing Aaron, or because of this Thailand cave situation, is going to be surprised once we’re back out there, playing our hearts out.” Wow. If you didn’t believe the Jets were cursed before, you probably do now. Well, this season certainly isn’t going the way Jets fans had hoped. Unfortunately, Vegas odds now say the team’s likelihood of making it to the Super Bowl is 800-1, with their odds of dying in the cave now 14-1. To put that in perspective, their odds of dying in a cave before the season was only 90-1. Yikes. Whether this season is a total wash remains to be seen, but it does not look good. Not at all."
Laying Down The Law: Pepperidge Farm Has Announced That It’s Fine To Pour Milk On Your Goldfish Crackers And Eat Them Like Cereal If You’ve Recently Lost A Kid Or Something But Otherwise Fuck That,N/A,https://clickhole.com/laying-down-the-law-pepperidge-farm-has-announced-that-its-fine-to-pour-milk-on-your-goldfish-crackers-and-eat-them-like-cereal-if-youve-recently-lost-a-kid-or-something-but-otherwi/,"Most brands are just happy to have you buy their products and pretty much stay out of telling you specifically what you’re allowed to do with them, but not Pepperidge Farm. The iconic snack brand recently swung their dick around by announcing in no uncertain terms that it’s fine to pour milk on your Goldfish crackers and eat them like cereal if you’ve recently lost a kid of something, but otherwise, fuck that.  And there you have it. Pepperidge Farm has spoken.  Yep, the brand is officially laying down the law on loading up a bowl of their popular bite-sized, cheddar-flavored baked snack and dousing that shit in milk like Count Chocula. As of this week, the back of the packaging for every one of Pepperidge Farm’s many Goldfish cracker varieties will feature a large-print warning asking that consumers not engage in this behavior. The copy reads, “At Pepperidge Farm, we feel for those who have lost a child unexpectedly or have recently been diagnosed with terminal cancer. For those Goldfish fans, who are undoubtedly too distraught to make normal meals and may have limited grocery items to choose from, pouring milk on Goldfish crackers and eating them with a spoon like cereal is understandable and allowed. For everyone else, however, FUUUUUUCK that. You’re fucking nasty if you even think about doing that.” The company’s website goes into further detail to delineate the groups of customers for whom chowing down on a bowl of soggy Goldfish in 2% is permissible. In addition to the aforementioned grieving parents and cancer patients, the list includes people who are being kept locked in a basement by a kidnapper, people who have run over their own pet within the past 24 hours, and suicidal people who need to eat some nasty-ass shit to snap them out of it. Otherwise, the website makes it clear that, “Even if you’re a war hero or an ER nurse, no, you cannot put a snack with so much bold, cheesy flavor in milk and go at that shit like it’s Frosted Flakes. Even if no one’s around to see you do it, you sick freak. NO.” Well, if you had any questions about this, there you go.  So what do you think? Is this something you’ve always wanted to try? Are you disappointed that Pepperidge Farm is putting their foot down like this? Are you the parent who recently lost a child who is relieved to know that doing this is okay? Let us know in the comments! And remember, we don’t make the Goldfish-related rules here, Pepperidge Farm does. Happy snacking!"
What Exactly Does This Demonstrate? This Urologist’s Office Is Displaying An Hourglass Filled With Piss,N/A,https://clickhole.com/what-exactly-does-this-demonstrate-this-urologists-office-is-displaying-an-hourglass-filled-with-piss/,"Doctors are certainly within their rights to take some artistic license when they decorate their offices, but this medical practice has adorned its lobby with an object so perplexing we can’t help but question the design choice: This urologist’s office is displaying an hourglass filled with piss. Ummmm, okay? What exactly is this supposed to demonstrate? The Lakeside Urology Clinic in Duluth, Minnesota has plenty of typical doctor’s office decor items in its waiting room, including an aquarium containing a single fish and a bubbling plastic treasure chest, one of those toys where toddlers slide wooden beads around a curved metal track, and a stack of two-year-old copies of Cycling World magazine with a doctor’s home address on them. But one object is a real head-scratcher: An oversized hourglass filled with a yellow fluid clearly meant to represent piss slowly draining through it. Upon first encountering the piss hourglass, one might assume that it is a visual aid meant to help patients understand an important principle relating to urinary health, but in this case, what principle could that possibly be? Is the hourglass suggesting that your body has a finite amount of piss inside it that will eventually run out? Is the top portion of the glass meant to represent the piss that’s still inside your body and the lower portion meant to represent a toilet, with the narrow neck in between the two representing genitalia? Is it meant to be cautionary in some way? Is it saying that at some point you will run out of piss until someone turns you upside down, at which point you will become completely filled with piss again? The longer one ponders this odd choice of decor, the more baffling it becomes. Absolutely bizarre. WTF is an hourglass filled with piss supposed to mean??? This clinic clearly believes the piss hourglass has an important urinary health message to convey, because a nurse just flipped the thing over as soon as all of the piss had dripped into the bottom. What are we missing here? Do you have any idea what this could mean? Let us know in the comments!"
‘DO NOT SERVE THIS MAN’: This Diner Only Has A Picture Of Richard Kind Hanging On The Wall Because He Dined And Dashed There,N/A,https://clickhole.com/do-not-serve-this-man-this-diner-only-has-a-picture-of-richard-kind-hanging-on-the-wall-because-he-dined-and-dashed-there/,"Typically when a restaurant keeps a photo of a celebrity on their wall, it’s to highlight the fact that the celebrity visited and had a great time. But in the case of the Morristown Diner in Morristown, NJ, there’s a much more alarming reason: This diner only has a picture of Richard Kind hanging on the wall because he dined and dashed there. C’mon, Richard. You know better than this. Guests who visit the Morristown Diner will immediately be greeted by a framed picture of acclaimed character actor Richard Kind hanging on the wall by the register, but where there is usually a signature from the celebrity with a cheerful message to the diner owners, instead there is an angry note reading “DO NOT SERVE THIS MAN.” According to Morristown Diner employees, Richard Kind showed up in 2008, ordered two egg salad sandwiches, sent each sandwich back three times requesting that they be “eggier,” and then left without paying for anything. Hanging nearby the photo is the receipt from his meal—revealing that Richard was either unable or unwilling to pay the measly $17.37 bill.  Richard, you get pretty steady acting work—you really couldn’t pony up? Richard’s photo stands in stark contrast to the other celebrity photo on the diner’s wall, a glossy headshot of Henry Winkler captioned “PAID IN FULL – WELCOME BACK ANYTIME.” Damn. If you know Richard Kind personally, please slap him. It’s always fun to know that you’ve eaten at the same place as a celebrity, but the excitement in this instance is tempered by the fact that Richard Kind is clearly a criminal. If you patronize the Morristown Diner, you can rest assured that a famed comedic actor has also had a meal there, but also that he did not enjoy it, and ultimately screwed the restaurant out of almost $20. What an interesting piece of diner lore!"
‘I Don’t Do That’: This Man Whose Friends Are Poking Fun At A Small Personality Quirk He Didn’t Realize He Had Is Denying It Like A Cornered Animal,N/A,https://clickhole.com/i-dont-do-that-this-man-whose-friends-are-poking-fun-at-a-small-personality-quirk-he-didnt-realize-he-had-is-denying-it-like-a-cornered-animal/,"Yikes, this is hard to watch. What began as lighthearted fun has devolved into one deeply insecure man’s battle to save face: This guy whose friends are poking fun at a small personality quirk he didn’t realize he had is denying it like a cornered animal.  Oof. There’s nothing worse than learning something weird about your behavior from people who will roast you for it at every possible opportunity. Shaun Cook, a 28 year-old Tulsa, OK resident, is currently on a full-court press defensive to counter any and all of his buddies’ claims that he licks his lips a lot when he gets excited during a conversation—a trait that everyone in their friend group except Shaun himself has been aware of for years. One of his friends called out the behavior several minutes ago when Shaun 100% did lick his lips while animatedly discussing a band he just got into, and the group soon erupted in unanimous agreement that lip-licking is a signature Shaun thing they had all observed individually but had never discussed before. Visibly mortified to learn that he was a lip-licker, Shaun resisted the observation with the tense, fearful demeanor of a gazelle being ambushed by lions.  “No? What? I don’t do that, what are you even talking about?” Shaun denied, too panicked to realize that the more he showed his friends how much he’d let a low-stakes comment on his body language get under his skin, the more viciously they would harp on it. “No, no, I absolutely do not do that ‘all the time,’ that’s such an exaggeration. That’s so not true. You guys always do this,” he continued, lashing out like a scared moose calf kicking at circling wolves. At the same time, Shaun was internally devoting every ounce of his mental energy to not licking his lips—which he accidentally did again mere minutes after the group had moved onto a new topic of conversation, cementing his status among his friends as the resident lip-licker forever.  Unfortunately for Shaun, he definitely does do that. And his self-preserving protests have clearly fallen on deaf ears, because all his friends are now doing impressions of him licking his lips at each other.  Damn. Just minutes ago, Shaun had no idea about this unconscious habit at all. But now, lip-licking will be tied to him forever, especially since he reacted to this observation like an injured warthog fighting off a pack of wild dogs instead of taking it in stride. Any mention or sight of someone licking their lips will trigger a flood of self-consciousness in him, and it’ll be this way for the rest of his life. Rough. Hang in there, Shaun!"
Major Breakthrough: Mathematicians Have Discovered The Number 8 Hovering In The Desert And Making A Humming Noise,N/A,https://clickhole.com/major-breakthrough-mathematicians-have-discovered-the-number-8-hovering-in-the-desert-and-making-a-humming-noise/,"A stunning new mathematical result has just been announced that experts say will revolutionize the field forever: Mathematicians have discovered the number eight hovering in the desert and making a humming noise. Mind. Blown. This is a truly major breakthrough. The discovery occurred when mathematicians from M.I.T. were on a field expedition in the Nafud Desert in central Saudi Arabia. There, they discovered the number eight floating about three feet above the desert sand making a noise that one mathematician described as “a hum so quiet you could barely hear it, yet listening to it drowned out all your thoughts.” After using their graphing calculators, the researchers confirmed that this was, indeed, the number eight, which caused immediate celebration among mathematicians all over the world. “A lot of us thought that we’d never find eight in the desert making a noise like a whispering demon, but now that it has I’m just so happy and amazed,” said Terence Tao, a professor of mathematics at UCLA who is widely considered to be one of the greatest mathematicians in the world. “A discovery like this opens up so many new avenues for study, such as what does eight taste like and does eight scream if we throw bricks at it? I can’t wait to find out.” The discovery of the number eight floating in the desert has already led to several new and significant discoveries that build upon the researchers’ original results. A joint team of mathematicians from Harvard and the University of Cambridge recently published a paper confirming that the number eight casts the shadow of the number 12 across the desert sands as it hovers. As if that wasn’t amazing enough, Grigory Perelman, the reclusive Russian mathematician famous for proving the elusive Poincaré conjecture, recently went to the desert and shot the number eight with a crossbow—a breakthrough that many experts predict will win him the prestigious Abel Prize, sometimes called the “Nobel Prize of math.” This is seriously so cool. There really seems to be no limit to the new discoveries that can be made after this incredible advancement. It’s amazing to know for sure where the number eight is hovering and what it sounds like. Kudos to the mathematical community on this groundbreaking new find!"
Another Harambe Situation? Grandma Won’t Let Go Of Your Sister’s New Baby,N/A,https://clickhole.com/another-harambe-situation-grandma-wont-let-go-of-your-sisters-new-baby/,"Everyone remembers the tragic story of Harambe, the Cincinnati Zoo gorilla who zoo workers shot and killed to save the life of a small child who’d fallen into Harambe’s enclosure. Unfortunately, history might just be repeating itself in your sister’s living room: Grandma won’t let go of your sister’s new baby. Not good. This is not good at all.  Everyone at the family gathering was taking their turn holding Ellie, your sister’s infant daughter, until your grandmother got ahold of the baby and refused to let anyone take her away, hurrying from corner to corner of the living room anytime your sister or her husband attempted to regain control of their child. Over 45 minutes have passed, and although Grandma’s body language suggests she feels protective towards Ellie—with one hand clutching the baby close to her chest and the other perched on her walker for balance as she feebly scampers away from intervening family members—every second that passes with someone as frail and unsteady as Grandma cradling Ellie just increases the risk of something going horribly wrong.  The clock is ticking, and that means a decision needs to be made soon, because unless Grandma puts the baby down of her own volition, there may be no choice but to resort to tranquilizing her with a syringe of warm milk to the neck, or worse…lethal force. In fact, your uncle already has a rifle locked and loaded, and should the situation escalate, your sister and brother-in-law may be forced to give him the go-ahead to compromise Grandma if it means their baby’s safety. This is getting bad. The last thing anyone wants is to turn Grandma into Harambe 2.0, but she’s not giving the family many options.  Ugh, what a horrifying situation. The worst thing anyone can do right now is make Grandma feel threatened, so the whole family is doing their best to stay calm as possible to avoid making Grandma aggressive. Let’s pray that Grandma gets tired and falls asleep on the couch soon like she usually does at family parties, because all anyone wants is to get Ellie out of her possession without either of them getting hurt.

Devastating: Mom Just Filed For Divorce After Reading Online About A Man With A Bigger Penis Than Dad’s,N/A,https://clickhole.com/devastating-mom-just-filed-for-divorce-after-reading-online-about-a-man-with-a-bigger-penis-than-dads/,"Get ready for a major bombshell that’s going to change our family forever: Mom just filed for divorce after reading online about a man with a bigger penis than Dad’s. Wow, this is just devastating. You’ve really gotta feel for Dad here. Mom announced the news at dinner last night when she clinked a spoon against her glass to get everyone’s attention and said, “I have a little announcement to make: I was scrolling on the iPad last night and I read about a man with a big dong. Bigger than your father’s. I’ve decided to divorce your father and go live with the man with the big penis from the internet.” She then went back to eating her lasagna as dad put his head in his hands and started weeping. Absolutely heartbreaking. I guess you can’t blame Mom for going after what she wants, but it’s definitely going to take some time to adjust to this new situation. According to Mom, she read about the man when she did a Google search for “big and wonderful man” while trying to remember the name of the actor John Goodman. While this Google search did not provide her with the name she was looking for, on the 26th page of the search results she discovered an article titled “Meet The Wonderful Big Penis of a Man,” which was a 10,000-word profile about a man whose penis was over a quarter-inch longer than Dad’s. Mom says that she immediately fell in love and woke Dad up to say, “I’m leaving you for the big-dicked Casanova I read about online.” She then slowly pushed Dad off the bed and onto the floor with her foot and went to sleep. Dang. This is really going to make things stressful around the house for the next few months. Last we checked, Mom was packing her bags while Dad was frantically Googling things like “will rubbing sunscreen on penis make it grow” and “how to make wife stay through penis transformation.” Sadly, he hasn’t been able to find any answers, and Mom is basically ready to walk out the door and start her amazing new life with the man with a bigger penis than Dad’s. Good luck to Mom on her awesome next chapter, and here’s hoping Dad finds the strength to move on soon!"
"The Saga Continues: JK Rowling Just Wrote ‘PROFESSOR LEGS’ On A Post-it Note, Stuck It On A Fire Hydrant, Then Gave The Fire Hydrant A Thumbs-Up",N/A,https://clickhole.com/the-saga-continues-jk-rowling-just-wrote-professor-legs-on-a-post-it-note-stuck-it-on-a-fire-hydrant-then-gave-the-fire-hydrant-a-thumbs-up/,"After more than two decades of delighting readers with tales of the wonderful wizarding world, the Harry Potter author continues to give updates that never disappoint, and her latest is no exception: JK Rowling just wrote “PROFESSOR LEGS” on a Post-it Note, stuck it on a fire hydrant, then gave the fire hydrant a thumbs-up.  Simply incredible! This addition to the Harry Potter universe is truly amazing! Earlier this week, the author made the fascinating update to the thrilling world of Harry, Ron and Hermionie when she power-walked out of a drugstore in central London, pulled a pen out of her bra and wrote “PROFESSOR LEGS” onto a Post-it she’d possibly just shoplifted. As if cementing this new character into the HP canon for good, Rowling proceeded to stick the Note onto a fire hydrant before giving it a thumbs up and a little shimmy—effectively letting all Harry Potter fans know that Professor Legs is here to stay! This is so exciting!! She is truly a genius at work!  Fans are speculating that Professor Legs could be some type of half-dog, half-human hybrid who teaches at Hogwarts, a guess based around the fact that after posting the Note to the fire hydrant, Rowling made a beeline toward the nearest public park where she proceeded to push a dog off a bench and before lying down for a nine hour nap. However, because several spiders reportedly crawled all over Rowling during her outdoor slumber, some fans suggest Professor Legs may be an eight-legged spider-human hybrid instead! Well, it seems safe to say that whoever Professor Legs is, he’s going to be a new fan favorite character. Here’s hoping he teaches spells about legs! Wow. Being a Harry Potter fan is truly the gift that keeps on giving. What an awesome glimpse into the creative process of one of the most successful authors of all time!"
Not A Great Sign: Duolingo Just Added A Language Called “Space Termite” And Is Only Teaching Words For Expressing Submission And Obedience,N/A,https://clickhole.com/not-a-great-sign-duolingo-just-added-a-language-called-space-termite-and-is-only-teaching-words-for-expressing-submission-and-obedience/,"Everyone’s favorite language-learning app has made a major update to its curriculum, and it’s pretty grim to say the least: Duolingo just added a language called “Space Termite” and is only teaching words for expressing submission and obedience. Yikes. This is not a great sign. The new Space Termite language appeared on the Duolingo homepage early yesterday morning next to a flag that seemed to depict the silhouette of a pair of insect mandibles crushing a human skull. Disturbingly, it was also automatically added to all current users’ list of languages, regardless of whether they had actively selected it. Anyone logging onto Duolingo since the update has been greeted by an animation from Duo the Duolingo owl in which he hops around next to a speech bubble that says, “It’s time to learn to speak the language of the Space Termites! You have 20 days to become fluent or you will become nutrients!” The first lesson in Duolingo Space Termite curriculum is called “Greeting The Brood,” and teaches users how to write and pronounce phrases such as, “At last you are here,” “I am your puppet,” and “Our planet is but a single chamber in your hive that spans the galaxy.” Though most of the phrases are directly related to giving and receiving orders, Duolingo has also included some key everyday phrases, such as expressions related to parts of the body (“My head is your dinner.”) and asking where the bathroom is (“I do not need to know where the bathroom is, I am the bathroom. Humanity is the bathroom.”). It all feels a little ominous, especially since getting even one question wrong in the Space Termite module causes Duo the owl to pop up with a speech bubble that says, “Your error has been reported to your hemisphere’s swarm-master.” One of the upsides of this new addition to the Duolingo app is that the Space Termite curriculum seems pretty manageable. There are only four Space Termite language lessons on Duolingo: “Declaring Your Assimilation,” “Begging For Forgiveness,” “Thanking The Brood For Their Cruelty,” and “Praising The One Who Lays The Eggs.” Still, even though there’s not a ton of material to learn, it definitely seems like a red flag that each of these lessons ends with a lengthy Space Termite Pledge Of Loyalty, which users are required to translate and enunciate at full volume into their phones. It’s also disconcerting to note that, according to Duolingo, the Space Termite language replaces the pronoun “I” with the phrase “The worm who is currently speaking” and that the only two verb tenses in the language are “Before Being Digested” and “While Being Digested.” All in all, it’s hard to read this new addition to Duolingo’s language selection as anything other than a bad sign for the human race. Dang. It really seems like something terrifying is coming down the pipe. In its most recent update released earlier today, Duolingo added the phrase, “My body is groceries for the One Who Lays The Eggs” to every single language curriculum on its platform, and began sending users five emails a day with the subject line, “It Makes Duo Cry When You Fail To Learn The Words Of The Hive.” Guess we better start learning how to speak Space Termite as soon as possible. According to Duolingo, we don’t have much time left!"
Undermining The Cause: This WGA Member Tweeting Out His Absolutely Horrible Movie Idea That A Studio Rejected Has No Idea How Reasonable He’s Making Hollywood Execs Look,N/A,https://clickhole.com/undermining-the-cause-this-wga-member-tweeting-out-his-absolutely-horrible-movie-idea-that-a-studio-rejected-has-no-idea-how-reasonable-hes-making-hollywood-execs-look/,"As the WGA strike enters its fifth month, the continued solidarity among screenwriters remains a powerful example of how workers can fight for fair compensation together. That’s why it’s so unfortunate to see what’s happening on Twitter right now, where one writer is singlehandedly undermining the Guild’s entire cause: This WGA member tweeting out his absolutely horrible movie idea that a studio rejected has no idea how reasonable he’s making Hollywood execs look. Yikes…the WGA’s higher ranks really ought to intervene here. If this man continues berating studio execs for passing on his terrible, terrible writing, it could set the labor organization’s progress back by decades.  Jeremy Tomlin, a 40-something screenwriter with 11.6k followers whose bio vaguely lists “Freeform” as a writing credit, has been posting the plot summary of a straight-up hack movie pitch that multiple studios apparently rejected from him, seemingly under the impression that it’s a damning example of how “studios stand in the way of good art” rather than an indictment of his own taste and writing abilities. The story Tomlin is attempting to use to garner support and sympathy for writers’ struggles is about how Hollywood executives passed on his pitch for a raunchy animated comedy that he describes as “Toy Story but with sex toys”—and he clearly has no idea that anyone outside the industry reading his tweets would understand perfectly well why a development executive would not want to pay him a large sum of money for that concept. Still, Tomlin is doggedly trying to tie his failed pitch to the guild’s motivations for striking, alleging that “this is what we’re fighting for: a Hollywood where writers are REWARDED for boldness, and not told ‘No’ by executives who put their bottom line over our art.” Of course, we want greedy, anti-labor pigs like Bob Iger to pay up as much as anyone…but somehow, this guy has found a way to make their decision-making look sensible.  The bad look has only grown worse as Tomlin’s Twitter posting has gone on. Later in the thread, Tomlin revealed that one production company had in fact paid him $20,000 for an 10-page treatment for his self-described “sex-positive animated comedy boasting the satirical wit of Sausage Party,” which he seems to think is a paltry sum rather than a shocking overpayment. Not even the staunchest progressive could be blamed for respecting the executives who decided not to invest any further money in this self-aggrandizing weirdo who claims that his failure to get this awful idea sold “represents everything wrong in the industry.”  Wait…could this screenwriter be an AMPTP operative? It’s honestly a little suspect how every single tweet he posts manages to chip away further at all the goodwill Hollywood writers have going for them. Unfortunately, if this man doesn’t stop asserting himself as a poster child for what the WGA’s fighting for, he’ll cause serious PR damage to the cause. The WGA needs all the support it can get to come out of AMPTP negotiations with streaming residuals and safeguards against A.I, so they might want to revoke this guy’s union card, permanently. Godspeed, WGA: we’re rooting for you and praying this talentless freak doesn’t hurt your chances of obtaining an equitable contract!"
He’s Back: Rudy Giuliani Just Fully Restored His Dignity And Social Standing After Finding The Perfect Beret For His Head Shape,N/A,https://clickhole.com/hes-back-rudy-giuliani-just-fully-restored-his-dignity-and-social-standing-after-finding-the-perfect-beret-for-his-head-shape/,"It’s easy to forget that Rudy Giuliani was once lauded as “America’s Mayor” given the numerous legal troubles he’s mired in today. However, in spite of how far Giuliani’s reputation has fallen in the public eye, it turns out hitting rock bottom was only a prelude to the second act of his career: Rudy Giuliani just fully restored his dignity and social standing after finding the perfect beret for his head shape. Well, it’s official: America’s Mayor is BACK, all thanks to his beautiful new beret! Talk about a glow up!  Earlier this week, just as the former NYC mayor’s sexual misconduct allegations and racketeering indictment had brought his career to a devastating low point, Giuliani’s public approval rating did a complete 180 after he was seen sporting a mulberry-colored wool beret outside of his Manhattan office. According to a Gallup poll, a stunning 100% of Americans now have “a favorable view of Rudy Giuliani and his stylish, head-shape-complementing beret,” which is a figure that stands in stark contrast to the 7% favorability rating Giuliani had just a week ago. Along with the universal embrace of the American public, Giuliani has also won his way back into the hearts of the political elite—including Hillary Clinton, who issued a statement saying that “while myself and Mayor Giuliani certainly have our ideological differences, there’s no denying that Rudy’s beret has brought out the best in him and his face shape. No American can hold Rudy’s transgressions against him so long as his headwear remains so impeccably suited for his cheekbone structure.”  Rudy’s new beret has also been met with an outpouring of love from celebrities and politicos alike, ranging from heartfelt social media endorsements from Ice Spice and Josh Gad to an episode of The Rachel Maddow Show in which Maddow stated that Rudy’s beret “embodies the elegance and poise of the Rudy we all know and love,” and exhorted her audience to “stop holding Mr. Giuliani’s transgressions against him, and start celebrating just how classy he looks in that beret of his.” Not only has Giuliani been unable to walk in the streets of New York without receiving standing ovations from pedestrians, but he’s also been announced as the subject of Time Magazine’s next cover, in a profile titled “Dressed For A Comeback: The Beret That Resurrected Rudy Giuliani From The Ashes Of Dishonor.” Welcome back to honor and esteem, Rudy!  As far as public opinion, it truly seems like it’s all uphill for Rudy from here on out. It just goes to show that the perfect hat can totally save your legacy, no matter how many sexual and political crimes you’ve committed. Our hats are off to you and your outstanding beret, Mr. Giuliani!"
True Crime Blunder: Police Have Confirmed That The Woman Found Dead Along The Side Of I-95 Was Actually Just A Very Beautiful Raccoon,N/A,https://clickhole.com/true-crime-blunder-police-have-confirmed-that-the-woman-found-dead-along-the-side-of-i-95-was-actually-just-a-very-beautiful-raccoon/,"True crime fans and citizen sleuths were sent into a frenzy last week after Connecticut police began investigating the circumstances surrounding the body of an unidentified young woman discovered by the highway near New Haven, but anyone who got interested in the shocking case has some potentially disappointing news coming their way today: Police have confirmed that the woman found dead along the side of I-95 was actually just a very beautiful raccoon. Whoops! Guess we can consider this unsolved murder case closed. Early last week, Connecticut police held a press conference pleading for tips from the public regarding the untimely death of “a young woman, aged 19-25, possibly a model or some sort of pageant queen,” whose body was found lying beside a guardrail at the edge of I-95 near the Long Island Sound. In the intervening days, online followers seized on the sparse details police released, which included speculation that the victim was killed by a jealous incel who resented her beauty, and that her body may have been staged near the highway as an example to other women. But soon after the description of the woman’s “slender build, feminine fingers, and dark charcoal eye makeup” resulted in a lead connecting the case to a missing New York City actress, the police disconfirmed this theory, and further admitted that the corpse had turned out to be that of an “unusually gorgeous adult raccoon.” “While we hoped that the discovery of the remains of the I-95 Jane Doe would lead to the resolution of any number of cold cases involving missing women from the Eastern Seaboard, we have unfortunately confirmed that the remains belonged to a raccoon of two to three years of age, which likely died either of disease or due to having been struck by a vehicle,” Chief of Police Samuel McDermott explained. “As beautiful as the raccoon may have been, we do not believe that there was foul play involved in its death. We found ourselves so moved by its supple curves, piercing eyes, and radiant hair that we were blind to its true form, and we regret any pain we caused to those who put tireless effort into determining the identity of the woman whose death we thought we had on our hands.” What a shame. What seemed like a juicy true crime case was nothing but a dead raccoon, albeit a physically beautiful one. If you’re looking for a murder case to follow, you’ll have to find something different. Too bad!"
Awesome: Apple Has Announced That The iPhone 15 Will Notify You When It’s Time To Throw It Into The Sea,N/A,https://clickhole.com/awesome-apple-has-announced-that-the-iphone-15-will-notify-you-when-its-time-to-throw-it-into-the-sea/,"With so many tech fans anxiously awaiting the drop of Apple’s newest iPhone, the tech giant has stepped up to reveal a key feature of their upcoming product: Apple has announced that the iPhone 15 will notify you when it’s time to throw it into the sea. Yes! This is so awesome! Earlier today, company insiders confirmed the rumor that Apple’s newest mobile device will come with an alert that will notify users when it’s time to say goodbye to the constant onslaught of bullshit on their phone and just chuck that thing into the sea for good. The notification will reportedly appear whenever a user gets more than five notifications in a minute, receives an email from their boss between the hours of 10 p.m. and 6 a.m., or gets a text that says “Hey! Just following up,” from someone they were clearly trying to ignore. Although most details about the iPhone 15 are still under wraps, insiders say that the notification will offer two possibilities for a response: 1.) an option to dismiss the alert, and 2.) immediate directions to the nearest large body of water via Maps. This totally rocks!!  Although Apple has long offered stopgaps for people who feel uncontrollably, helplessly addicted to their phones, such as the “Do Not Disturb” setting and the ability to outright delete an app, with this new feature, they’ve answered the pleas of iPhone users who know that the only rightful course of action after visiting the same person’s Instagram page three times in one day is to throw their phone into a lake and finally get one goddamn moment of peace. Plus, this stands to be an incredibly profitable move for the company, as recent data trends show that most users will last three, maybe four hours without a phone before inevitably returning to the Apple store to buy a new one.  So epic. This is seriously a must-have for any iPhone user who has ever felt defenseless against their daily nine hours of screen time. Sound off in the comments if you’ll be getting the iPhone 15 after hearing about this feature!"
Embarrassing: This Man’s Tan Line Is Very Clearly From Wearing A Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Disk,N/A,https://clickhole.com/embarrassing-this-mans-tan-line-is-very-clearly-from-wearing-a-yu-gi-oh-duel-disk/,"Get ready to feel some secondhand shame, because the following story is about an unfortunate situation that many gamers know all too well: This man’s tan line is very clearly from wearing a Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Disk. Yikes. How embarrassing. Last week, Toby Rechzer, age 28, left his home in Detroit, MI to join his family on a weeklong vacation to the Dominican Republic. Unfortunately, the trip left Toby with a very distinctive circle-shaped patch of white skin on his otherwise entirely red arm that is unmistakably the result of having worn his Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Disk the entire time he was in the sun. While it’s mortifying enough to get this bad of a sunburn, it’s even worse to get one that immediately lets everyone know that you spent your vacation leaping around in the Caribbean sand dunes with a Duel Disk on, ignoring your family in favor of pretending you were one anime guy battling a different anime guy.  Poor Toby. Honestly, with that much Yu-Gi-Oh!, it’s almost like he vacationed in Domino City instead of the Dominican Republic.  Despite the fact that Toby frequently reapplied his SPF 70 sunscreen, the Punta Cana rays were just too strong for someone who hadn’t spent more than two consecutive hours in the sunlight since he dropped by the Naruto exhibit outside the convention center at last summer’s Comic Con. Perhaps the burn wouldn’t be so obvious if Toby had ever taken even one afternoon’s break from the adapted version of Yu-Gi-Oh! that he engineered at age nine so he could play the game by himself, but then again, he didn’t cart his deck all the way to the D.R. not to spend the whole day defeating Seito Kaiba with his Blue Eyes White Dragon.  Damn. You really have to feel for Toby. Although he’s already made up an excuse to a coworker that the tan line was from “tying his surfboard to his arm,” it’s pretty clear to anyone who’s ever seen the Obelisk the Tormentor action figure on his desk that it was much more likely from using the Duel Disk he got for his birthday in 2005 to play Yu-Gi-Oh! alone all week. Remember to apply that aloe, Toby, and your skin will heal up soon."
Dire Warning: The Ska Awareness Foundation Has Announced That The World Is On Track To Hit Record Levels Of Ska Disinterest By 2030 Unless Dramatic Action Is Taken,N/A,https://clickhole.com/dire-warning-the-ska-awareness-foundation-has-announced-that-the-world-is-on-track-to-hit-record-levels-of-ska-disinterest-by-2030-unless-dramatic-action-is-taken/,"Ever since the popularity of American ska music peaked in 1996 with the release of Reel Big Fish’s hit song “Sell Out,” ska disinterest has been steadily on the rise, and now, according to a new study released earlier this week, humanity’s indifference to ska may soon reach a critical point of no return: The Ska Awareness Foundation has announced that the world is on track to hit record levels of ska disinterest by 2030 unless dramatic action is taken. This is so tragic.  This study by the Ska Awareness Foundation released in tandem with the National Ska Defense Council found that a variety of co-occurring factors, such as lack of a “Best Ska Album” category at the Grammys and the fact that ska songs literally never crack the top 40 charts, have led to a catastrophic decline in ska appreciation over the last 25 years. As a result, we are on track to reach total ska irrelevance by the end of the decade, which is far earlier than ever before predicted. Experts say that without intervention, this state of affairs will become irreversible—within a decade, the amount of bands made up of 14 out-of-shape middle-aged guys in suits scream-singing together will approach zero, and profound apathy towards the idea of skanking to the beat of a trombone in a church basement dance hall will prevail among the general population Simply heartbreaking. Fortunately, the International Ska Taskforce has created the 2030 Ska Outreach Plan, a multi-step program designed to reverse the trend of ska disinterest. With proposed legislation that would mandate at least one Hot Topic is in every municipality, as well as a government initiative that would provide a free tie and pair of checkered Vans to any teenager with a budding neckbeard, ska scientists remain hopeful that the trend of disinterest can be slowed before it’s too late.  However, more hard-core ska advocates argue these actions are far from enough and will only delay the point at which Streetlight Manifesto poster sales peter out entirely. Therefore, some ska activists argue that in order to truly reverse these levels of ska disinterest, concerned citizens will need to enact a full-blown ska revival, which is why these ska fans can often be found calling pop radio stations to demand they play whatever single the Mighty Mighty Bosstones have most recently released. Wow. We had no idea that the situation was this dire. Here’s hoping that ska can make a comeback, and fast, or else this loud, strange genre of music could be gone from our culture sooner than we could have imagined. "
Get Psyched MCU Fans! Marvel Has Just Announced An Upcoming Movie Where Where Spider-Man Desperately Tries To Sell The Vintage Pornography Magazines Uncle Ben Left Him In His Will,N/A,https://clickhole.com/get-psyched-mcu-fans-marvel-has-just-announced-an-upcoming-movie-where-where-spider-man-desperately-tries-to-sell-the-vintage-pornography-magazines-uncle-ben-left-him-in-his-will/,"If you’re like us (and pretty much everyone else on Earth), you’ve been looking forward to the next Spider-Man movie in the MCU more than pretty much anything else in the world. Fortunately, it looks like those months of anticipation will soon be at an end because we finally know when the next Spider-Man movie is dropping, and it sounds like it’s going to be epic. Marvel has just announced an upcoming MCU movie where Spider-Man desperately tries to sell the vintage pornography magazines Uncle Ben left him in his will. Okay…somebody pinch us, because this movie sounds like a Marvel fan’s ultimate dream. Marvel dropped the trailer for the new film, ‘Spider-Man: Home Away From Home’ in a surprise midnight post on social media and it’s already set the fandom on fire. Fans have long wondered why Uncle Ben has been absent from the Tom Holland Spider-Man movies, and we finally get our answer in the first ten seconds of the trailer, when Peter gets an email from Thor explaining that Uncle Ben choked on a golf ball 15 years before Peter was born, and that it’s time for him to meet Uncle Ben’s attorney for the reading of his uncle’s will. The trailer then cuts to Peter, in his Spider-Man costume, sitting in the office of Uncle Ben’s attorney, who is played by Josh Brolin, the actor who also played Thanos. The attorney says, “I know I look like Thanos if he wasn’t purple, but I’m not,” and Spider-Man says, “Thanks for letting me know.” The attorney then reads Uncle Ben’s will, which is absolutely heartbreaking: “To my nephew Peter Parker, I leave my treasure chest of skin mags. I hope my enormous pornography collection makes your life incredible. I hope you never become Spider-Man. Sincerely, Uncle Ben.” The attorney then presents Spider-Man with a 300-pound treasure chest packed with pornography published between the 1970s and 1990s with the words “Uncle Ben’s Porn” written on it. “I believe this is for you,” the attorney says. Leave it to the MCU to make us cry during the trailer! The rest of the trailer shows Spider-Man traveling all over the multiverse trying to offload the big cumbersome box of porn his uncle left him. Fans get a glimpse of some of the challenges our favorite webslinger will face when he has to save the world while carrying a gigantic box of vintage erotica–in one shot Spider-Man shoots a web at the box then ties the other end of the web around his waist like a belt and starts dragging the porn box behind him, significantly reducing his speed and agility. In another heartbreaking moment, Spider-Man’s beloved MJ can be seen getting carried away by a gigantic robot while Spider-Man slowly hobbles after her with Uncle Ben’s pornography bouncing and jostling around behind him. “Uncle Ben’s porn is slowing me down!” he calls after MJ as the robot carries her into the distance. Later in the trailer, Peter Parker, with the box of porn still dragging behind him by the web he tied to his waist, visits Tony Stark’s grave. He’s crying (because real heroes aren’t afraid to be vulnerable) as he says, “I miss you Tony. I know you would have bought all this porn for a billion dollars. I don’t know what to do. I feel so lost. I’d keep the porn for myself, but magazines are boring to me because of how much better the internet is.” To make matters worse, it looks like Spider-Man is going to have a ton of trouble finding a buyer for his newly inherited pornography. There’s a shot of Loki flipping through a 1985 issue of a magazine called Butts For Uncles while Spider-Man says, “The whole box is yours for $500.” Loki says, “I’ll give you $100,” and Spider-Man says, “those golden age back issues of Uncle’s Delight are worth $250 alone. No deal,” before he swings away with the treasure chest of porn. Other MCU favorites who show up in the trailer are Nick Fury (who tells Spider-Man that he can’t buy Uncle Ben’s porn because his eye patch covers his “porn-reading eye”), Groot (who points to the Crucifix around his neck and says, “I am Groot” to indicate to Spider-Man that his beliefs as a Christian forbid him from purchasing pornography), and Tobey Maguire’s Spider-Man (who has his own chest of identical pornography that his own Uncle Ben left him in his universe). It’s just a small taste so far, but we’re pretty sure Spider-Man’s going to try to sell this porn collection to a lot more of our favorite heroes over the course of this movie! “This movie isn’t just going to be an awesome Spider-Man movie—it’s also going to be a meditation on loss and grief,” MCU mastermind Kevin Fiege wrote on Twitter right after the trailer dropped. “We can’t always choose what kind of porn of loved ones leave us, but we can choose what we do with the porn we inherit, and that’s what this movie’s really about.” Well, looks like Mr. Feige just proved once again why he’s the biggest genius in the history of Hollywood! This is seriously some of the most exciting news to come out of the MCU all week! We can’t wait to see Tom Holland back on the big screen as our favorite webslinger trying to hawk the skin mags his dead Uncle forced him to keep in his apartment. Just tell us when pre-order tickets go on sale so we can see it in IMAX on opening night!"
Real-Life Pokémon? There’s A Rat Inside This Beach Ball,N/A,https://clickhole.com/real-life-pokemon-theres-a-rat-inside-this-beach-ball/,"If you loved Pokémon growing up, prepare to feel incredibly jealous of the Asbury Park, NJ beachgoers who are witnessing something straight out of Ash Ketchum’s adventures: There’s a rat inside this beach ball!  Yes!!! Eat your heart out Pokémon fans, it just doesn’t get cooler than this! No sunbather could be blamed for thinking a Poké Ball had rolled out of a Gameboy and onto the Jersey shore just now, because the sight of this multicolored beach ball containing a ferocious rodent is as close to real-life Pokémon as it gets! The ball is careening around the sand in sudden lurches, accented by the frantic movements of the rat silhouette inside, which appears ready to battle any of the seagulls or water-winged toddlers it keeps bumping into. Judging by how violently this beach ball is shaking, you’d think a level-50 Radicate was ready to pop out and escape into the tall grass of an abandoned commercial development lot in downtown Asbury Park!  The uncanny parallels to Pokémon here are truly remarkable. In fact, an unsupervised 10-year-old Japanese boy jammed the fidgeting beach ball inside his backpack, and later hurled it at an unsuspecting couple on the boardwalk—uh, literally, is this Ash Ketchum duking it out with Team Rocket?! Seriously, either there’s some diehard Pokémon cosplay going on at the beach today, or this is one mind-blowing instance of life imitating art! Wow. Who would’ve thought Asbury Park, NJ was the closest a Pokémon fan could get to exploring Kanto?! Yup, this is pretty much every kid’s dream come true. You’re not alone if this rat-containing-beach-ball made you want to scream “Gotta catch ‘em all!” and update your Pokédex. Talk about nostalgia overload!"

Then, within 24 hours, they will receive a video message in which the actor  unpacks the potential causes of and possible treatments for their mental health issues.

A Broken System: This Exhausted Doctor At An Underfunded Hospital Has Had To Shrink Down To The Size Of A White Blood Cell 15 Times Today,N/A,https://clickhole.com/a-broken-system-this-exhausted-doctor-at-an-underfunded-hospital-has-had-to-shrink-down-to-the-size-of-a-white-blood-cell-15-times-today/,"Years of corporate greed and political apathy have left America’s healthcare system barely functional, and that breakdown has placed a terrible burden on the professionals trying their best to provide care: This exhausted doctor at an underfunded hospital has had to shrink down to the size of a white blood cell 15 times today. Fucking shameful. That’s what you get in a country that values profits over people! Dr. Bruce Tiernan does everything he can for the patients of his rural Vermont hospital, but budget cuts and staffing shortages have left him swamped with a completely overwhelming workload of microscopic adventures inside his patient’s bodies. Just today, he’s had to step into his Shrink-O-Matic 3000’s smallification chamber no fewer than 15 times, carefully piloting the tiny submarine Triton through the winding passageways of the human body to diagnose and treat patient ailments before finally slipping out through a tear duct to activate his rebiggifier and conducting a quick follow-up. It’s small wonder doctors are experiencing such high rates of burnout when Tiernan can barely find two minutes to return to normal size and gulp some coffee before being shrunk and injected into another patient’s body. Just today, Tiernan has had to spend a total of more than ten hours at a size of 12 microns tall, braving swift arterial currents and fearsome packs of antibodies in his minuscule submarine. One of this morning’s procedures even involved a perilously close call with the snapping phagosome of an amoeba—an incident that could have been avoided with another set of hands to man the Triton’s laser array—but whenever Tiernan begs the hospital’s private equity ownership to hire more doctors or at least upgrade the Triton’s sluggish evasion thrusters, they just brush him off with the same tired bullshit about “tough economic realities” while hoarding the filthy lucre they wring out of his and others’ suffering. Those non-stop journeys through treacherous mires of mucous membranes and hissing oceans of stomach acid take a serious physical and mental toll, and fatigue is a dangerous prospect when one false move in a patient’s sinuses could mean being sneezed the equivalent of miles across the room. Tiernan has resourcefully figured out how to sneak in the occasional power nap when a voyage takes him to the pillowy alveoli of the human lungs, but those rare breaks can only do so much. When brutal 20-hour shifts blasting apart blood clots and wrangling thunderous stampedes of spermatozoa are the norm, nothing but deep systemic change can give doctors like Tiernan the relief they so sorely need. Richest country in the world, by the way. Can’t stress that enough. “It was already getting bad before COVID, but since the pandemic I probably spend more time riding red blood cells through capillaries like a waterslide than I do walking around the hospital normal size,” said Dr. Tiernan, lamenting that simple stress had ended as many of his colleague’s careers as ambushes by antibiotic-resistant MRSA strains. “We want to help, but when the system stretches you this thin, you’re asking yourself, is this the day I accidentally activate my rebiggifier while I’m still in the patient’s heart? Is this the day I nod off and wrap the Triton around a motor neuron? Is this the day I go into an infected lymph node and never come back out?” Damn, America’s doctors deserve better than this. Here’s hoping for a future where their safety and well-being comes before someone else’s financial gain!"
Absolutely Fucking Horrifying: Someone Is Gently Knocking At The Door At 2:15 In The Afternoon,N/A,https://clickhole.com/absolutely-fucking-horrifying-someone-is-gently-knocking-at-the-door-at-215-in-the-afternoon/,"If you’re a horror junkie who wants to hear something so fucking terrifying you won’t be able to sleep for days, here you go: Someone is gently knocking at the door at 2:15 in the afternoon.  Holy shit. This is a nightmare scenario.  Yep, a sunny, laid-back afternoon just became a chest-pounding, cold sweat-inducing nightmare now that a gentle, non-urgent rapping is calling for attention at the front door, indicating the presence of a visitor at an hour of the day when no friends, family members, or even deliveries were expected. Could it be a pair of elderly religious missionaries? An overeager political canvasser? A weird person who is having car trouble and for some reason doesn’t own a phone? A parentless child selling candy? Each disturbing possibility of what frightful sights could be behind that door is more bone-chilling than the last.  Knock knock. Knock knock knock.  Being that it’s midday, there’s an obvious temptation to simply pretend as if no one is home, but that opens up the possibility of an even more horrifying scenario: More knocking. As paralyzing as the fear of the initial knocking may have been, the level of anxiety and horror caused by a follow-up knock would be even worse.  Is it better to confront whatever guilt-tripping fundraiser or eye contact-making stranger is here to invade normality head-on, or to draw the blinds and hide in a closet while praying until the threat has passed? Sadly, all options here are equally nightmarish.  Knock knock knock.  This is a petrifying scenario, plain and simple. No amount of foresight can ever prepare someone for the horrors that are unleashed when a set of knuckles meets a door in the middle of the day. You’d be forgiven for biting your fingers down to the bone after hearing about this, because this is as unsettling as it gets. "
Pathetic Beta Cuck: This Fertility Doctor Uses Other Men’s Sperm To Impregnate His Patients ,N/A,https://clickhole.com/pathetic-beta-cuck-this-fertility-doctor-uses-other-mens-sperm-to-impregnate-his-patients/,"If you’ve ever wanted to get a good look at a lowly, pathetic beta cuck who loves nothing more than getting humiliated and dominated by other men, look no further: This fertility doctor uses other men’s sperm to impregnate his patients instead of his own.  Dude, these women are literally paying you to knock them up, and you’re using other dudes’ sperm to do it? What a cuck! Dr. Evren Yavuz of Fairfax Cryobank in Fairfax, VA is practically swimming in women who are dying to get pregnant, but since he’s apparently a total pussy who lets other men walk all over him, he’s impregnating them with the sperm of their chosen donors instead of using his own. Dr. Yavuz has women come into his office every day in desperate need of sperm, but the first thing Dr. Cuckenstein here does is trip over himself trying to find them another dude to provide it. This beta weakling even goes so far as to ask his patients the height, ethnicity, and preferred profession for their donor, knowing damn well they aren’t going to answer “a 5-foot-7 Turkish sperm doctor.”  Look, we don’t like to kink shame, but have some goddamn self respect, Dr. Yavuz. What sperm doctor in their right mind would let other guys impregnate THEIR clients and miss out on the opportunity to father HUNDREDS of children all around the country? Why let other men rob you of the joy of knowing that your genes are carrying on your legacy with absolutely no effort needed on your part to raise the offspring, you little bitch? Jesus, man. Do you sit down when you piss?  There doesn’t appear to be any sign that our scared little boy here is going to reach down and find a pair of stones between his legs anytime soon, but who knows. Maybe one of these days the shame of watching other men’s seed being injected into women with his own syringe will be more than he can bear and he’ll finally man up and start doing his own impregnating like a real alpha dog. But until then, shame on you, you absolute cuck. "
Added Authority: This Policeman Is Wearing A Witch Hat,N/A,https://clickhole.com/added-authority-this-policeman-is-wearing-a-witch-hat/,"In the United States, police officers typically derive their authority from a badge and a gun, but one member of law enforcement seems to have augmented his power with an extra accessory: This policeman is wearing a witch hat. Wow! It looks like this officer has the power of both the state police force and dark magic on his side! Martin Keyes, a patrol officer in Akron, Ohio, may be making his typical rounds in the city’s downtown today, but he is commanding more respect than ever thanks to the jet black witch’s hat that sits atop his head. Any would-be criminals in Akron will likely be thinking twice about shoplifting or pickpocketing when they see the forbiddingly pointy tip of Officer Keyes’ hat coming down the sidewalk—a hat that suggests that he is perhaps a sorcerer in addition to being a police academy graduate. It would be impossible to tell just by looking at Officer Keyes whether he’d be more apt to handcuff you or turn you into a toad with his magic wand, and it’s just that ambiguity that gives him some extra weight to swing around while he does his job maintaining law and order. We are seriously in awe of this incredibly powerful, potentially magical police officer. You won’t catch us committing any crimes in Akron today, because the mere sight of Officer Keyes’ getup has us quaking in our boots. If you don’t want to get arrested or hexed, keep your distance!"

Wow. It really doesn’t get much worse than that! Olivia Mattheson, a receptionist at Philadelphia marketing firm Pierson Associates, has spent the past six months pining for her older boss, Head of Branding Leon Grant—but no matter how much time she spends organizing his emails exactly to his liking and planning her day around running into him in the elevator, the power of her love cannot overcome the fact that Leon is desperately obsessed with Mitzi, a multicolored puppet he saw in a touring production of an off-Broadway musical called “Puppet University.” Truly, the situation is a tragic no matter what angle you view it from: it’s painful to watch Olivia sit at her desk, surreptitiously scrolling through Leon’s Instagram account to look for evidence of a girlfriend, and just as painful to note that as she does so, Leon sits in his office with the blinds down, repeatedly watching a YouTube sizzle reel of the musical in which Mitzi, who is puppeted by a middle-aged woman clad in black jeans and a black turtleneck, can be heard singing a doo-wop-style song about how Puppet University lacks funding for her arts club. Olivia has been trying desperately to impress Leon with her sleek business-casual skirt sets and subtle references to her enjoyment of classy Philly restaurants, having no idea that he is enamored with just the opposite type of woman—a loudmouthed puppet with hair made of purple yarn, who can be seen violently humping Puppet University’s athletic director character during the homecoming football game song in the play’s second act. God, this is hard to watch. Just last week, Leon asked Olivia what she thought of age-gap relationships, which she believed to be a clear come-on, as he is ten years her senior—but when she used his computer to help him resize a PDF later that day, she was crestfallen to see the recent Google search “how old is mitzi the puppet,” followed by “regular man and puppet happy together?” and “dating puppet effect on corporate career.” She tried to put the searches out of her head as she returned to her desk, and was again excited when he came over to lean down to her and ask her if she knew anywhere good to eat around the Orpheum Theater, but sadly, he immediately followed up the question by asking her to book a single front row ticket for twelve consecutive nights of Puppet University’s run. Olivia must be catching on to Leon’s interest in another woman-slash-puppet, especially after he accidentally called her Mitzi when she wore a brightly colored, puppet-like top just yesterday, but that doesn’t make it any easier. It’s clear from the way she looks at him that Olivia has imagined her and Leon’s entire life together, and it’s clear from the way he opens the Puppet University playbill to gaze at the glossy photo of Mitzi wearing a giant church hat and belting into a handheld mic that Leon has a different, also highly unlikely future planned. At the end of the day, this is just one of the saddest love triangles imaginable. There’s almost no chance anyone ends up happy. We’d cross our fingers, but it seems pretty bleak. Here’s hoping that Olivia, Leon, and even the woman who plays Mitzi all find some peace."
Getting Serious: This Man Just Jolted Up Out Of Bed At 3 A.M. To Write “NO MORE EXCUSES” Into His Notes App,N/A,https://clickhole.com/getting-serious-this-man-just-jolted-up-out-of-bed-at-3-a-m-to-write-no-more-excuses-into-his-notes-app/,"Do you have trouble feeling motivated? Can’t find the inspiration to live up to your full potential? That’s a struggle Dan Hertzfeld, 33, of Brookline, Massachusetts, was all too familiar with—until now. By all appearances, he’s officially ready to quit pissing his life away and get serious: This man just jolted up out of bed at 3 a.m. to write “NO MORE EXCUSES” into his Notes app.  Wow! This is all the proof you need to know this guy finally found that dog in him!  Say goodbye to the Old Dan, who always had high ambitions for himself but never took any meaningful action to achieve them, and say hello to the New Dan, who pledged “NO MORE EXCUSES” in his Notes app at 3:03 a.m. after spending several sleepless hours hyping himself up to start eating healthier, working out, and setting aside an hour every day to work on a script idea he’s had for six years but never started. Though it’s true that Dan has felt this random surge of life-altering motivation while trying to fall asleep on at least a dozen occasions in the past—even just last month, when he wrote out a small to-do list, with bullet points such as “run”, “buy fruit (berries, apple)”, “read 1 hour”—this time? It’s for real.  Truly, this three-word Note is Dan’s own Moses on the mountaintop moment, a personal code of honor that he will live by forever, effective immediately at 7:30 a.m. sharp, which is the new alarm time Dan set for himself during his rush of inspiration. Old Dan would absolutely have snoozed that alarm six times minimum, but not New Dan. Nope. New Dan gets up when it’s time to get up. New Dan doesn’t make excuses. New Dan doesn’t waste a second of his precious life. New Dan gets it done, starting tomorrow.  In fact, this is the last night Dan ever touches his phone after hitting the hay, because it’s finally clicked for him that having his phone so easily accessible on his nightstand is the cause of his sleep issues, which contribute to his low energy levels during the day, which are exacerbated by his poor dietary decisions, which prevent him from thinking clearly at his job, which is why he never is in the mood to work out after work, etc. etc. Dan has figured out his entire life in the four hours he’s spent unable to fall asleep because he drank Monster Energy at 5 p.m. like he swore he wouldn’t the night before. And now that he has a Note reminding him not to make excuses anymore, Dan won’t make the same mistakes ever again. We’d say best of luck to this man, but it doesn’t look like he’ll need it if this Notes app oath is any indication. Here’s to the beginning of the rest of your new, improved, totally fulfilled life, Dan!"
Falling On Hard Times: The Pope Is Clearly Living Out Of The Popemobile,N/A,https://clickhole.com/falling-on-hard-times-the-pope-is-clearly-living-out-of-the-popemobile/,"From declining membership to Vatican scandals to political infighting, the Catholic Church has long been beset by troubles, and now it seems like these issues are beginning to take a devastating toll: Pope Francis is clearly living out of the Popemobile.  Absolutely heartbreaking. Whether you support the Catholic Church or not, you have to feel for Pope Francis here. Pope Francis all but confirmed concerns that he’s been living out of the Popemobile this past Sunday evening, after press spotted the Pontiff heating up canned soup on a portable electric stove inside of the bulletproof vehicle, where he then ate dinner and slept until it was time to preside over Mass the next morning. Usually reserved for the Pope’s public appearances, the Popemobile is now jammed with trash bags of clothes and parked near permanently on a street right outside the Vatican, only moving when the Pope is hassled by Holy City parking enforcement officers. His Holiness, reportedly evicted from his papal apartment next to St. Peter’s basilica for failing to make rent several months in a row, now relies on a YMCA down the road for showers, a tragic sign that the Catholic Church is well past its glory days as one of the most powerful institutions in all of history.  When asked to comment on his current living situation, Pope Francis flat-out denied that he lived out of the Popemobile, alleging that it was stuffed with belongings at the moment because he was “helping a friend move,” and that if he’s seen changing into his papal vestments, cooking, or sleeping in the Popemobile, it’s because he’s “an incredibly busy man, constantly on the go.”  So, so sad. Though Pope Francis has long been known for embracing humility and denouncing the luxurious lifestyles of previous Popes, this is simply not reassuring for Catholics concerned about their church’s current trajectory. Hopefully the church can find a more suitable living arrangement for Pope Francis soon, because this is not a sustainable way for the Head of the Catholic Church to live. "
Awesome: The New England Patriots Have Transformed 75% Of Their Stadium’s Seating Into Private Breastfeeding Pods ,N/A,https://clickhole.com/awesome-the-new-england-patriots-have-transformed-75-of-their-stadiums-seating-into-private-breastfeeding-pods/,"Ask any new mom, and they’ll tell you that NFL games aren’t an ideal environment for breastfeeding. But now, one forward-thinking team has made that a problem of the past: The New England Patriots have transformed 75% of their stadium’s seating into private breastfeeding pods.  Amazing! Whether you’re a Patriots fan or not, you simply can’t deny that this franchise cares about pumping in privacy! For decades, breastfeeding at a Patriots game meant doing so out in the open surrounded by screaming, beer drunk fans, and occasionally looking up to see your infant attempting to latch onto your bare breast on the stadium’s jumbotron. Thankfully, those days are over, because this upcoming NFL season marks the debut of Gillette Stadium’s tens of thousands of private breastfeeding pods that have replaced the majority of each section’s regular seating, so that up to 49,000 new moms have access to a discreet, free-standing space to breastfeed or pump during Patriots games. Each breastfeeding pod contains a TV live-streaming the game, as well as a retractable window slot in the pod’s wall, through which lactating mothers can purchase hot dogs and soft drinks from stadium vendors so they won’t have to miss a second of the live New England football experience in order to nurse their infant.  The Patriots’ thoughtful gesture to the new mothers and wet nurses of their fanbase doesn’t stop there: The six-time Super Bowl winning franchise is also offering branded breastfeeding merchandise, including privacy nursing covers bearing text “This Breastmilk Is Reserved For Patriots Fans Only,” silicone pumps in the shape of New England mascot Pat Patriot, and breastmilk storage bags bearing the face of fan-favorite players and Head Coach Bill Belichick.  Name one other NFL team going this far out of their way to accommodate moms…we’re waiting!  Well, the Patriots have officially raised the bar for how NFL franchises can show their support for new moms. Let’s hope other teams follow in New England’s footsteps, because this is how feminist-minded football is done!"
Taking Another Crack At Rebranding: Elon Musk Has Changed The Twitter Logo To The Pepsi Logo And Renamed It ‘Pepsi’,N/A,https://clickhole.com/taking-another-crack-at-rebranding-elon-musk-has-changed-the-twitter-logo-to-the-pepsi-logo-and-renamed-it-pepsi/,"If you’re trying to follow all of the seemingly haphazard and occasionally downright confounding changes instituted by Elon Musk since his takeover of Twitter, here’s another major one to take note of: Just days after removing Twitter’s iconic bird logo and rebranding the app as simply “X,” Musk has changed the logo to the Pepsi logo and renamed it “Pepsi.” Whoa! Looks like Elon Musk isn’t going to stop tweaking things at Twitter until he gets them just to his liking. The change was announced at 3:23 AM PST last night when Musk tweeted simply, “X is now Pepsi,” with a photo of a giant illuminated Pepsi logo being installed on the roof of the former Twitter headquarters in San Francisco. The company’s url was changed from twitter.com to pepsiapp.com, where the landing page shows a Pepsi logo with Pepsi’s official slogan, “THAT’S WHAT I LIKE,” written in condensation-covered blue and red letters underneath it. All references to both Twitter and X have been removed, and the app’s functionality appears unchanged, with the only apparent differences being that tweets are now known as “pepsis” and retweets have been renamed “repepsis.” Wow. You don’t have to be a total Elon Musk stan to admit that his latest move as the owner of Twitter is definitely a compelling one. Just like the rebranding of Twitter to X wasn’t without its controversies, Pepsi is undoubtedly going to have its own, not the least of which being that its name, logo, and slogan are already in use by the largest beverage company in the world.  Elon is known for his counterintuitive and iconoclastic thinking, though, so we’re going to wait to see where he’s going with this one before weighing in. It’s definitely going to be interesting to watch how this pans out."
"At Last Night’s Concert Someone Threw A Battery At Drake, But Then He Caught It And Whipped It Right Back, And Then They Just Kept Throwing It Back And Forth, And It Was Cool For A While But Then Kinda Boring",N/A,https://clickhole.com/at-last-nights-concert-someone-threw-a-battery-at-drake-but-then-he-caught-it-and-whipped-it-right-back-and-then-they-just-kept-throwing-it-back-and-forth-and-it-was-cool-for-a-while-but-t/,"This summer, there’s been an unfortunate spike in incidents in which fans throw objects at musicians while they’re performing onstage. While many artists have denounced these actions due to their potential for serious harm, the latest incident proves this trend also has the potential to be deeply boring: At last night’s show at Madison Square Garden, someone threw a battery at Drake, but then Drake caught it and whipped it right back, and then they just kept throwing it back and forth, and it was cool for a while but then kinda boring. Yikes. No concertgoer should have to suffer through something like this. In the middle of performing his 2018 hit “Nice For What,” Drake abruptly stopped rapping as a size D battery was thrown at him from somewhere in the pit. Fortunately, Drake quickly caught battery and prevented what could’ve been a pretty gnarly injury, and as he proudly held the battery up to the crowd, the whole place went wild with cheers. Drake then shouted, “If you come for the king, you best not miss,” before immediately chucking the battery back at the culprit to even louder applause. But in a total surprise twist, the guy caught the battery again, too, and so he and Drake entered into a heated battle while the crowd chanted “Drake! Drake! Drake!” However, things definitely took a turn when Drake no longer appeared angry at the guy at all, and even started laughing and smiling while throwing the battery at the man. In fact, as seen in cell phone footage, after a couple minutes the whole thing straight up just looked like two guys having a good time playing catch. At that point, Drake’s backing music officially cut out, as someone backstage must’ve realized Drake was way too engrossed in this game of catch to finish “Nice For What” any time soon, and even the fans who were filming the interaction put down their phones. Fans started booing and yelling at Drake to start rapping again, but it fell on deaf ears as Drake and the guy were joyfully lobbing underhand tosses to one another. C’mon, Drake. People paid good money for those seats. No one wants to see this for more than a minute or two. But after half an hour of uninterrupted catch, even Drake’s most dedicated fans accepted that Drake had no intention of performing the rest of his set and it was time to head out. As the lights came on in MSG to signal that the concert was over, Drake and the guy continued throwing the battery back and forth as every last attendee left the arena. Goddamn. This just goes to show that this trend of throwing stuff at musicians seriously needs to stop, because it doesn’t just come with the danger of harm, but with the danger of boredom, too."
Heartwarming: Wayne Brady Has Agreed To Play A Televised Game Of ‘Hoedown’ With Any Ghosts Whose Unfinished Business Is Doing That,N/A,https://clickhole.com/heartwarming-wayne-brady-has-agreed-to-play-a-televised-game-of-hoedown-with-any-ghosts-whose-unfinished-business-is-doing-that/,"If you or someone you know is a ghost who was obsessed with the long-running short-form improv comedy TV show Whose Line Is It Anyway?, you’re in luck, because one of the show’s cast members just stepped up to help you out in a major way: Wayne Brady has agreed to play a televised game of “Hoedown” with any ghosts whose unfinished business is doing that. Wayne, this is just too kind. Wayne Brady made the announcement via a “Hoedown”-style song posted on his Instagram earlier today. In the video, Wayne marches in time to a recording of the melody as he sings: “If you are a ghost
Or just anyone who’s died
And playing a game of Hoedown
Keeps you from the other side. Then it’s my promise to you
With God as my witness:
Come wake me in the night
And finish your unfinished business!” After the music stopped, Wayne Brady then explained that he simply would not be able to live with himself knowing that there are ghosts out there who are not able to achieve eternal rest because they first need to play a round of “Hoedown,” a comedy game popularized by Whose Line wherein participants improvise a country-style song with a simple ABCB rhyme scheme. Wayne also added that he will be amenable to each ghost’s personal requests when he helps them complete their unfinished business, such as making sure that Laura Hall and Linda Taylor are there to play the accompanying music, or even making his own “Hoedown” verses only kind of funny on purpose so that the ghosts can get the biggest laughs. Wayne proceeded to clarify that while he’s definitely willing to play “Hoedown” as much as needed to meet demand, it would be best if ghosts could coordinate so that he could play with three ghosts at once—though he’s not sure how feasible that is since he doesn’t know if ghosts can all talk to one another or what. Wow. Wayne Brady has gone above and beyond with this one, and the goodness of his heart is clear. Here’s hoping ghosts take him up on this offer, because a gesture this generous should not go unnoticed."
"Highly Irresponsible: This Man Bought A Struggling Mom’s Groceries, Distorting Free Market Incentives And Creating Economic Moral Hazard",N/A,https://clickhole.com/highly-irresponsible-this-man-bought-a-struggling-moms-groceries-distorting-free-market-incentives-and-creating-economic-moral-hazard/,"The U.S. economy is not exactly thriving at the moment, and unfortunately, some bad actors like the one in this story are making matters worse with their reckless behavior: This man bought a struggling mom’s groceries, distorting free market incentives and creating economic moral hazard.  What a dangerously irresponsible thing to do. This kind of chaos is literally the last thing our economy needs right now. Earlier today, David Najarro, a financial consultant, was in line at his local Foodtown supermarket when he noticed that a mother of three young children had had multiple credit cards declined—and in that moment, Najarro decided to pay for the groceries himself, blatantly scorning the basic principles of economic competition that make up the very foundation of our country’s consumer system. Not only has Najarro interfered with the organic flow of supply-and-demand transactions between a buyer and seller, but he has also perverted this working single mother’s role as a free market participant with three mouths to feed on a minimum wage job into that of a consumer untethered from the actual value of her limited resources. With one wave of his AmEx, Najarro rendered this struggling woman’s $14,000 credit debt completely meaningless, warping any incentive she’d otherwise have to take her business to a supermarket with cheaper goods, or to seek a higher paying job that would let her afford Foodtown’s grocery prices. It’s not clear what Najarro thought he was doing here, but his careless actions have sent this woman and her surrounding economic community down a path of disorder whose disastrous endpoint we can scarcely imagine. Without even thinking, Najarro has singlehandedly eliminated any reason this woman had to shield herself from the economic risk of over-drafting her bank account to purchase a bagful of groceries. Ask any economist in the world, and they’ll tell you this is the kind of market intervention that ultimately leads to a country’s collapse. Hey, Mr. Najarro: Next time you want to play God with the free market by paying the tab for a struggling mother, maybe consider the economic disorder you’re creating first. "
Move Over Bookmobile!

But it looks like these moving libraries should take note, because one man has pretty much revolutionized the bookmobile: This man has a copy of Jane Eyre in his car that you can read in his back seat while he drives to Phoenix. Whoa! This is so cool! If you live anywhere between Oklahoma City and Phoenix, you’re in luck, because a man known only as “The Driver” has a copy of Jane Eyre in the backseat of his off-white 2008 Subaru Outback that you’re welcome to come read. Although The Driver won’t slow down his car so you can get in, the doors are always unlocked, and the backseat comfortably fits two adults, one child, and The Driver’s large duffel bag, the contents of which remain unspecified! Awesome! This is going to go such a long way to promote literacy! While the copy of Jane Eyre is pretty dog-eared at this point and there are several notes in the margins which incorrectly claim Mr. Rochester is a stand-in for Satan, readers are welcome to discuss any questions or comments they have about the novel with The Driver, who’ll share thoughtful critiques, such as “Uh-huh,” and “Yep, read that a while ago.” Although the car won’t make any stops for food, drink, or bathroom use, passengers are free to help themselves to any of the loose french fries or Cheerios they find wedged between the seats. Plus, if you finish the book before The Driver reaches Phoenix, you are welcome to open the doors and roll out of the car anytime you want! Yes! Now this is how you inspire people to read the classics!  This is such a game-changer! This man is going to go such a long way to encourage reading among people who live along a very specific route in the southwest. Your move, bookmobiles!"
What Happened To You? The Possibilities For Ringtone Customization Today Would Have Blown Your Mind In 2005 But You Just Use The Default Vibrate,N/A,https://clickhole.com/what-happened-to-you-the-possibilities-for-ringtone-customization-today-would-have-blown-your-mind-in-2005-but-you-just-use-the-default-vibrate/,"People change. Sometimes we change for the better—we learn, we mature, we grow. But sometimes we lose sight of ourselves and the things we once loved, and sadly, the last 18 years seem to have erased a core component of the person you used to be: The possibilities for ringtone customization today would have blown your mind in 2005 but you just use the default vibrate. Whoever you are now, you’re not the cell phone user we knew back then. There was a time when a chirpy, 30-second ringtone of Linkin Park’s “Breaking the Habit” seemed to you the very pinnacle of human joys; when considering which $1.99 ringtone to spend your hard-earned allowance on felt as weighty a question of individual expression as could be asked. But were we to dial your cell phone number today, it would be no “Boulevard of Broken Dreams” or “Mr. Brightside” that plays—no, only a dismal murmur of tuneless buzzing would announce the incoming call. We almost wish we could blame this sad state of affairs on some distant abstraction like copyright law or corporate cost-cutting measures, but the awful truth is that you yourself are architect of the drab and lusterless world you inhabit. Your childhood dream of limitless ringtone possibilities has become magnificent reality, and you reject these blessings for the hollow silence of a life meekly endured on vibrate mode. Imagine yourself back in 2005 finding a phone whose ringtone library was the very sum of musical creation, not just synthy approximations but the genuine articles from reggae to new wave to classical. Imagine learning that every contact could have their own unique ringtone: Gorillaz’ “Feel Good Inc.” for you best friend, The Strokes’ “Reptilia” for your dad, Daft Punk’s “Digital Love” for your special someone. Imagine your elation that the phone could even play a silly R2-D2 noise or the Metal Gear Solid codec sound for every incoming text message, and all of this for free with just the slightest effort! You’d have wept for joy. Well, such a miraculous phone sits at your side this very minute, but its possibilities are wasted on the tedious, zestless person you’ve become. You shrink away from any public celebration of your tastes and think of the prospect of Hoobastank suddenly blaring from your pocket on a crowded bus with shame instead of rapturous delight. And you abandon all this for what? Vibrate? The fucking DEFAULT vibrate? It’s your gutless cowardice that should shame you, not the custom ringtones! Sometimes, we dream of you coming to your senses and diving headlong into your phone’s ringtone settings with all the ecstatic awe you’d have felt in 2005, transforming the insectoid chittering of its default vibrations into a lush symphony of mid-aughts bangers as though you had lifted a curse. But alas, this will never be—you may wear the same face, you may even have the same phone number, but the person who once let calls ring so they could hear as much of “Take Me Out” as possible is dead. You slit their throat with a flick of your phone’s ringer switch to trade glorious music for the silence of a tomb. It’s really too bad that things wound up the way they did. This age of infinite phone customization and constant robocalls would have been your paradise in 2005, but looking at you today, we see only a broken old fool languishing in a ringtoneless hell."
Oh Hell Yeah: Looks Like All Of The Fraud The Person Who Stole Your Identity Is Committing In Your Name Is Actually Improving Your Credit Score Big-Time,N/A,https://clickhole.com/oh-hell-yeah-looks-like-all-of-the-fraud-the-person-who-stole-your-identity-is-committing-in-your-name-is-actually-improving-your-credit-score-big-time/,"It’s been a while since you’ve received any good financial news, but right now it seems that things are looking up in a major way: It looks like all of the fraud the person who stole your identity is committing using your name is actually improving your credit score big-time. Can we get a HELL YEAH?! This totally rules! When your email was hacked last month and a malicious criminal got ahold of all of your personal info such as your name, social security number, address, phone number, and passwords, your initial reaction was to freak out and assume that your credit was going to be irreversibly ruined. But due to the fact that your credit was so piss-poor to begin with that it had nowhere to go but up—combined with the counterintuitive complexities of how credit is built—your score has actually climbed a whopping 362 points and counting since you fell prey to a phishing scheme that your high school friend’s sister forwarded to you. Absolutely dope! Being that you never had the wherewithal to build up your credit using loans or credit cards on your own terms, your score was basically nonexistent—that is, until your hacker began apply for numerous low-limit credit cards in your name, thus establishing your credit for the first time in 32 years and bumping up your score over 100 points. Even better, by making a series of small purchases from innocuous-sounding shell companies on the cards to avoid arousing suspicion of fraud, and then using some of the cards to pay off others so the accounts would stay open, the thief began establishing a responsible payment history which brought your score up even higher. Finally, the crook requested credit limit increases on all of the cards they’d fraudulently opened and lied about your income by saying your salary is $700,000 a year, making both your debt-to-income ratio and your credit utilization ratio favorable for even more credit score bumps. Booyah! What a dream come true! This is an absolute game-changer. Thanks to a helpful hacker in Mogadishu or wherever, you’re finally capable of getting approved for a mortgage or taking out a loan for a brand-new car. It’s time to take yourself out to a $1,200 dinner on your new Visa Platinum Rewards card, baby, because by being so careless with your personal information, you’ve earned it. Whoever said crime doesn’t pay clearly has never had their credit score go up substantially due to having their identity stolen. Cheers to your new financial future!"
A Time Of Plenty: This Man Is Explaining To His Kids That In 2005 A Single JibJab Video Was Enough Content To Last Society An Entire Year,N/A,https://clickhole.com/a-time-of-plenty-this-man-is-explaining-to-his-kids-that-in-2005-a-single-jibjab-video-was-enough-content-to-last-society-an-entire-year/,"Gather round, one and all, gather round, for a tale is being told of a bygone age of wonder: This man is explaining to his kids that in 2005 a single JibJab video was enough content to last society an entire year. Ah, and what heady days of bounty they were! The bewitching journey into the past began when young Sally Pecci looked up from a post declaring the “Barbenheimer” meme officially over and asked her father if viral content had always had a half-life of between two and three weeks. “Not always,” stated Mr. Pecci matter-of-factly, going on to reminisce that when he had been a college student, a two minute parody song from JibJab.com had been all the content society needed to sustain itself for the whole of 2005. “That simple, rudimentary animation of George Bush singing about his plans for a second term was enough for people, and we went as wild for its barbs about taxes and the Iraq War in January as we did the next December,” he recalled with a wistful smile. “But wouldn’t the JibJab video be considered to have run its course once it was tweeted about by a politician or national restaurant chain?” inquired Sally’s brother Elias coming over from across the yard, his interest clearly piqued by his father’s captivating tale. “Well son, back in those days there was no Twitter,” answered the man, pausing to give his wide-eyed children a moment to make sense of what he had just said. “When we wanted to make a video go viral, we had to copy the link into an email and add our friends and coworkers to it one by one, and then convince them to go and do the same thing with all of their friends and coworkers. It was a heck of a lot more work than just hitting the retweet button and calling it a day, let me tell you, and that’s even before accounting for the download speeds.” Confused, Sally asked how people knew when they had to move on to a new viral phenomenon if there were no social media algorithms to tell them, to which her father replied that such a concern simply wasn’t something people of the time worried about—they would happily watch and rewatch the JibJab video as many times as they pleased without its digs at John Kerry and Jacques Chirac ever becoming stale. Who indeed would believe such a thing if they hadn’t lived it themselves? The kids have since pulled up a copy of the JibJab video on YouTube to see the fabled content firsthand, struggling to comprehend that it had once endured in popularity for a timespan equivalent to nearly thirty of today’s viral sensations. They briefly attempted to find a version with higher resolution before their father explained that 480p was as high as the clip would go, as people back then considered themselves damn lucky to get a video in 480p off Kazaa if they could do so in under an hour and without getting a virus or a version with Goatse spliced in, not to mention the fact that the CRT displays folks had could barely handle 480p as it was. As the family watched the crudely animated George Bush dance in front of the 2004 electoral map together, Sally and Elias were able to catch a fleeting glimpse of a lost time, a time before memes with weeklong lifecycles, a time before want, a time in which 2023’s unending churn of instantly obsolete virality would seem as alien and unthinkable as 2005’s limitless enjoyment of a single JibJab video seems to us today. Having finished the video, the elder Pecci is now sentimentally recounting for his spellbound children how merely reciting lines from the video was among the most popular activities at parties of the day, and was indeed the very manner in which he first caught their mother’s eye. Ah, how pleasant to recall those extravagant days of yore. May we one day be so lucky to find content that lasts us even half as long as that JibJab video lasted us then! "
Heartbreaking: This Funeral Has Devolved Into People Loudly Trying To Outbid Each Other For The Sneakers The Corpse Is Wearing,N/A,https://clickhole.com/heartbreaking-this-funeral-has-devolved-into-people-loudly-trying-to-outbid-each-other-for-the-sneakers-the-corpse-is-wearing/,"What was supposed to be a somber and dignified event to bid farewell to a loved one has instead turned into a heartbreaking scene of utter bedlam: This funeral has devolved into people loudly trying to outbid each other for the sneakers the corpse is wearing. Just awful. This should be a celebration of a man’s life, not a craven contest for who gets his shoes. The tragic trainwreck started just minutes ago at the Rolling Meadows Funeral Home in West Hartford, Connecticut, where mourners at the memorial service for Jerry Seaborne noticed that the deceased was wearing a pair of lightly used New Balance tennis shoes. Jerry’s son was in the middle of eulogizing his father when a voice in the back of the room shouted, “I’ll give you $30 for the shoes the dead guy’s wearing.” According to witnesses, this opening bid on the dead man’s shoes had come from his brother, 83-year-old Daniel Seaborne. New bids for Jerry’s sneakers then followed in rapid succession. His daughter-in-law Rita bid $35, which was immediately topped by his cousin Lance, who dramatically raised the bid to $250. Within minutes, nearly everyone at the funeral was shouting bids for the corpse’s shoes, driving the bid up to over $600. We’d say we feel bad for Jerry’s immediate family, but his wife and four children have also all started screaming bids for his sneakers. They’re making the whole situation worse. His youngest daughter Jordana even shouted that her late father “deserved to go in the ground barefoot” before placing a bid of her own for $800. So sad. Can’t the poor guy just rest in peace? Unfortunately, the heated bidding war over this dead man’s sneakers is showing no sign of stopping any time soon. The bids have now escalated to more than $10,000, and some of the mourners have offered to trade in their cars for a chance to walk home in the corpse’s sneakers. Here’s hoping that someone wins the auction soon so that some semblance of decorum can be restored to the proceedings and the departed can get the funeral service he deserves."
So Sweet! These Former High School Sweethearts Reconnected On Facebook 40 Years Later To Viciously Argue In The Comments Of A Bud Light Post,N/A,https://clickhole.com/so-sweet-these-former-high-school-sweethearts-reconnected-on-facebook-40-years-later-to-viciously-argue-in-the-comments-of-a-bud-light-post/,"Major cuteness alert! If you want to see the most adorable thing on the face of the earth, look no further than this: These two former high school sweethearts have reconnected on Facebook 40 years later to scream at one another about trans people in the comments of a post about Bud Light. Awwww! Get a room, you two! It’s been four decades since former teenage lovebirds Michael Sherwin and Margaret Beach were forced to break up when they left Daly City, CA for separate states to attend college, and they hadn’t spoken since. But all of that changed three days ago, when, despite not even being friends on Facebook, the site’s algorithm decided to work its magic and show Michael a comment Margaret had left on a post from a page called The Conservative Funnyman. The post, referencing Bud Light’s controversial partnership with a trans influencer, showed a bearded man in a dress holding a Bud Light with the caption “We now identify as the queen of beers,” which compelled Margaret to comment, “Thos poeple are SICK.” Seeing this angered Michael, and he wasn’t afraid to let his former prom date know it, responding, “You’re the sick one for beign a bigot !!”  And from there, it was like they were back in high school again. With the same fiery passion they once shared as innocent teenage lovers in the simpler times of the early ‘80s, the two nearly 60-year-olds continued to fire back progressively uglier comments at one another. In response to Michael suggesting that Margaret research trans suicide rates and realize that she was part of the problem, Margaret went OFF, leaving a comment at 3:38 AM reading, “You”re telling me I’m responsible for what other people do because of my OPINION. Well it’s not my problem they’re are a SNOWFLAKE , who can;t take a little joke , about they’re GENDER, which they have made into a big deal, NOT ME, by flaunting it everywherere they go!!!” to which Michael responded, “This: is literally the dumbest thing, I have ever read!!!and I’ve read a lot of dumb sh*t on Face Book.” Soooo cute! It’s like no time has passed since these two were making out in the backseat of an AMC Hornet at the drive-in. However you feel about social media, you’ve gotta admit it’s pretty magical when it helps two people who would have never reconnected otherwise scream at one another about social issues neither of them knows much about. Who knows what rancorous, spiteful chapter comes next in these two’s relationship. Whatever it may be, we are sooooo here to soak up the adorableness!"
Awesome! Barack Obama Just Released A Playlist Called ‘Night Driving (Shirtless)’ That Consists Of 72 Hours Of Wordless Carnival Music,N/A,https://clickhole.com/awesome-barack-obama-just-released-a-playlist-called-night-driving-shirtless-that-consists-of-72-hours-of-wordless-carnival-music/,"Last week, Barack Obama dropped his annual summer reading recommendations and music playlist, a highly anticipated tradition that never fails to generate major buzz. And now it looks like the Tastemaker-in-Chief has just struck again: Obama just released a playlist called “Night Driving (Shirtless)” that consists of 72 hours of wordless carnival music. Hell yes! This is an amazing glimpse into what Obama listens to when he’s driving around with his shirt off in the dark! The ex-POTUS posted the playlist at 2:30 a.m. last night on all all his social media accounts along with the message, “If you’re like me, then you used to be president and you like to toss your shirt in the pool, hop in your car, and drive in the dark while Michelle stays at home and practices her electric drum set. This is the perfect music for that.” Every song on Obama’s playlist, which when played end-to-end is over three days long, consisted of the bright, upbeat calliope music associated with circuses and carnivals. When someone on Instagram asked, “Why is it all carnival music?” Obama replied, “Because I listen to it with my shirt off,” and did not elaborate further. The president also showed off his impressively eclectic tastes by including a mix of old songs like 1979’s “Clown’s Emergency” and new material like “Juggler Finds You Always,” which was released earlier this summer. Fans of carnival music of all kinds are going to find something to love on this amazing playlist! While none of the songs had lyrics, some of them did include the sounds of people moaning in pain in the background while chipper organ music played. “The people moaning are clowns and acrobats,” Obama explained in a follow-up post. “And for those of you who are wondering: YES I chose the music myself. Someone from my staff tried to recommend a carnival song for my night driving playlist and I slapped him.” This is seriously so cool! Just when we thought Obama couldn’t get any cooler, he casually reveals to the world that he’s a big-time carnival music nut. Needless to say, this is going to be the main playlist blasting out of car stereos all over the nation for the rest of the summer!"
Blatant Nepotism: This Baby Has His Mother’s Beautiful Smile,N/A,https://clickhole.com/blatant-nepotism-this-baby-has-his-mothers-beautiful-smile/,"Some people clearly owe their success more to who they know than what they know, and one little scion of privilege seems to have already figured out just how far riding your parents’ coattails can take you: This baby has his mother’s beautiful smile. Must be nice, just having your winsome facial features handed to you on a silver platter like that. Ten-month-old Lucas Chesson doesn’t have a single achievement to his name, but thanks to a fortunate draw in the lottery of life—and fuck all else—he’s lucked into a bright-eyed, ear-to-ear smile from his mother Leanne without so much as an interview. Leanne doesn’t seem to have had any compunctions about keeping her radiant grin strictly within the family, passing over countless other qualified babies to make sure her kind brown eyes and bubbly, chime-like laugh went to the first kid who just so happened to carry the Chesson name. And young Lucas isn’t shy about flaunting his beaming countenance either, gleefully showing off his mother’s smile for cooing admirers in the grocery checkout line without any apparent misgivings over the rank corruption from which he’s benefitted. You’ve got to feel for all the babies watching Lucas coast through infancy on his family connections while they struggle to form an expression that doesn’t look like a DUI mugshot. Lucas is essentially playing babyhood on easy mode with those rosy cheeks and that cute button nose, all because his mother was able to pull some strings and cut him in on one of the most captivatingly angelic dispositions to ever grace this earth. And lest you think Lucas may have at least come by that shock of lustrous chestnut hair through his own ingenuity and hard work, a quick glance at his father’s satiny locks should tell you the boy’s smile is far from the only perk afforded to him by his chummy network of genetic forebears with a penchant for shameless favoritism. You didn’t earn that smile, pal. You haven’t earned shit in your life! As sleazy as this all feels, we can acknowledge that there’s always the outside chance Lucas might pull a Laura Dern and go on to prove himself worthy of the advantages he’s already been handed. Maybe he’ll end up being just as much of an effervescent charmer as his mother, who knows! It could happen. But you’ll forgive us if we’ve known one too many well-connected mediocrities to see this baby’s adorable smile as anything more than the smirk of a spoiled brat who knows he hit the jackpot while somewhere out there an actually deserving baby is stuck wearing the face of a concussed Vin Diesel. Ugh, there’s nothing worse than someone born on third acting like he hit a triple. Here’s hoping for a future where babies’ smiles say more about their actual skill at being infants than who their parents are!"
Financial Security Achieved: This Man Has Enough Vintage Dungeons & Dragons Manuals That He Can Live Off Of Selling Them On eBay For At Least 3 Months When He Gets Divorced,N/A,https://clickhole.com/financial-security-achieved-this-man-has-enough-vintage-dungeons-dragons-manuals-that-he-can-live-off-of-selling-them-on-ebay-for-at-least-3-months-when-he-gets-divorced/,"While many Americans struggle to find financial security, 43-year-old unemployed drummer Devin Morrison of Shreveport, LA recently achieved something that too few Americans do: He amassed a stockpile of so many vintage Dungeons & Dragons roleplaying manuals that he can easily raise enough money by selling them on eBay to rent an Airbnb and buy pizza and eggs for three months after he gets divorced.  Impressive! Here’s a guy who’s got all his ducks in a row. Yep, with Devin’s impressive stack of old D&D manuals such as Dungeon Master’s Guide and The Keep on the Borderlands that he’s been buying at garage sales and thrift stores for the past six years, it’s clear that he’s sitting pretty. While he doesn’t have any immediate plans to get divorced, with Devin’s lack of ambition, increasingly paunchy appearance, and numerous annoying behaviors, it’s just a matter of time before his wife asks him for one.  Given that his wife makes 100 percent of their household income, a divorce would put Devin in quite a financial pickle—that is, unless he hadn’t had the brilliant foresight to start building towards financial independence by amassing over 40 collectible Dungeons & Dragons manuals in excellent condition and putting them into protective sleeves in a pile on the floor next to his bed. With the knowledge that the proceeds from selling the original Monster Manual alone could cover his cell phone bill for the first month of bachelorhood, he can rest easy knowing that his future is covered for a good few months, or potentially even longer if he also decides to sell his plasma or some of his limited edition Phantom Menace Pepsi can collection.   Awesome! This goes to show how even just a little bit of financial planning can go a long way.  If someone as disorganized and unaccomplished as Devin can plan ahead like this, then the rest of us don’t have any excuse for not getting our acts together. Whether it’s amassing a bunch of vintage roleplaying manuals like Devin, selling old PS3 games, or collecting vintage skateboard decks, we can all find ways to take control of our financial futures starting today, whether we’re probably getting divorced or not."
"Disturbing: Newly Leaked Photos Reveal The Squalid, Inhumane Conditions In Which KFC Raises Its Cashiers",N/A,https://clickhole.com/disturbing-newly-leaked-photos-reveal-the-squalid-inhumane-conditions-in-which-kfc-raises-its-cashiers/,"If you were thinking about ordering KFC today, you’ll probably want to change your lunch plans, as a troubling new report has exposed some dark realities behind the fast food giant’s operations: Newly leaked photos have revealed the squalid, inhumane conditions in which KFC raises its cashiers.  Absolutely chilling. Shame on KFC.  Following a harrowing, months-long undercover investigation, Amnesty International has released a report detailing the inhumane conditions many of KFC’s hourly employees are forced to work under, with shocking photos of one of the cramped, hazardous warehouses where cashiers are raised by the thousands. From birth until they reach full maturity at age 16 and are sent to work at KFC franchises, these cashiers’ days are spent living atop their own waste and discarded hairnets in almost total darkness, being brutally molded to serve as ideal KFC employees.  Below are a few never-before-seen photos of the appalling conditions the cashiers are subjected to. (WARNING: These images contain depictions of abuse and severe neglect, and they may be disturbing to some readers). Jesus Christ. We’ve lost our appetite, probably forever.  Sadly, it’s not just the environment these cashiers are raised in that’s so horrific, but also how they are raised and conditioned to be docile employees. Fed from a massive industrial trough filled with leftover KFC Famous Bowls, these cashiers often gain weight rapidly, to the point that they are not only bursting out of their red and black, KFC-branded collared shirts and hats, but that their fingers are often too large to operate a cash register without hitting multiple buttons at once.  In response to the controversy, PR representatives for Yum! Brands, KFC’s corporate parent, have entered full damage control mode, issuing a series of statements insisting that the company “strives to source their cashiers ethically, and that the environment depicted in these photos does not meet KFC’s standards. Our relationship with the contractor in question has been terminated. We are now taking every effort to earn customer’s trust back, by ensuring that all our suppliers breed their cashiers in spacious facilities with access to clean water and toilets, as they deserve.”  Let’s hope this isn’t just lip service. The fast food industry is no stranger to controversies and unethical practices, but this latest bombshell is appalling on a whole new level. Fingers crossed that this new public scrutiny will force KFC to clean up their act and treat their employees like the human beings they are. "
What Actually Happens To Your Body When You Die? Exploring The 5 Stages Of Human Decomposition,N/A,https://clickhole.com/what-actually-happens-to-your-body-when-you-die-exploring-the-5-stages-of-human-decomposition/,"Death is one of the four things that all humans experience, along with birth, urinating, and getting a haircut. While it’s common knowledge that once you die your soul is carried to Heaven where Jesus stares at it without blinking and pokes it with a stick for all eternity, fewer people know what happens to your physical body after your immortal soul leaves it behind. Here is a list of the five stages of human decomposition that your body undergoes after death. As soon as you die, your body begins flopping around like a fish on the deck of a boat. The flopping is extremely violent, and your body can launch itself up to 12 feet in the air. During the flopping stage of decomposition, your friends and loved ones are advised to stay as far away from you as possible, since your flailing body is liable to smack them in the head or kick them in the stomach. Your body will flop around for about a month. If flopping continues past this point, your family may need to call a doctor to hit your body with a shovel over and over until it stops. Once it has completed its month of flopping around, your body reaches its peak ripeness and for the next week it is delicious. Your friends and loved ones should break off little pieces of you to enjoy as a snack, because this is the best you’re ever going to taste. After about a week, you become all rancid and start to taste sour and boring. When your body is no longer delicious, it is finally placed in the grave, where it will continue to taste worse and worse until the decomposition process is complete. After three to six months in the grave, your body is dug up by an old woman who waltzes with your corpse in the moonlight while classical music plays from an unknown source. Police could stop this from happening by arresting the woman, but she’s been very lonely since her husband died and it’s not like dancing with your corpse is hurting anyone. You’re dead, so you don’t mind one way or the other, and waltzing with your corpse gives her a fleeting moment of human connection during these final lonely years of her life. The dance typically lasts until dawn, at which point the old woman tosses your body back into the grave and covers it back up with dirt. Approximately six to eight months after your death, your tongue suddenly grows 50 feet long. Usually this results in your tongue bursting out of the ground where you’ve been buried and writing around like a cobra rising from a snake charmer’s basket. Your long, dead tongue will often snatch birds out of the sky, pluck fruit from nearby trees, and smack passing mourners in the face. This stage usually lasts for several months, at which point your tongue snaps back into the ground like a retracting tape measure. Once your tongue returns to your mouth, your body immediately turns into dirt. In the fifth and final stage of decomposition, your body leaves behind its last trace on this earth when a pumpkin in the shape of your head sprouts from the ground where you’ve been buried. If you lived a happy life, the pumpkin in the shape of your head has a smiling face, and if you lived an unhappy life, the face is frowning. If you were feeling sleepy when you died, the face on the pumpkin is yawning. The pumpkin usually grows for about a year before it’s harvested by the old woman who danced with your corpse, who then eats it raw. Your body has now fully decomposed. Congratulations!"
Man’s Best Friend In Action: This Heroic Dog Pulled His Owner Out Of A House Party With Bad Vibes,N/A,https://clickhole.com/mans-best-friend-in-action-this-heroic-dog-pulled-his-owner-out-of-a-house-party-with-bad-vibes/,"If you love dogs, get ready to love them even more, because this story is just further proof that dogs truly are man’s best friend: This dog pulled his owner out of a house party with bad vibes.  What an amazing pet! Turns out not all heroes walk on two legs! When Roanoke, VA resident Shane Polkowksi, 24, went to a co-worker’s house party last weekend, he sensed that the vibes were off as soon as he stepped inside and saw an alarmingly low-energy group of 11 total partygoers hanging out amongst themselves in three separate huddles—with one group comprising just two guys who were laughing way too hard as they played Business Walrus by themselves. But it was only when the host, the only person Shane knew at the party, informed him that none of their co-workers would be able to make it after all that Shane entered full-on panic mode. As he saw that the only alcohol in sight was room-temperature hard seltzer, heard a Morgan Wallen song playing on a very small Bluetooth speaker, and noticed the only two women at the party saying goodbye to the host, Shane realized he was in deep, deep trouble.  That’s when Finley, his golden retriever, did something absolutely incredible: Sensing that her owner was trapped inside one of the worst social environments imaginable, she raced across town, burst through the window, and dragged Shane out into the street. Finley had come to the rescue just in the knick of time, literally moments before Shane was about to be cornered into making small talk with three quiet guys who were hometown friends of the host. Needless to say, Finley earned herself more than a few Milkbones for that one! What’s even more amazing is that Finley’s heroic efforts didn’t stop there: she continued dragging Shane by his belt buckle all the way down the street to a much better house party she’d sniffed out, where Shane got a handjob in the bathroom within 30 minutes of arriving.  This is such a beautiful reminder of the profound love dogs can have for their owners! We’re literally crying right now! Finley deserves a million belly scratches for rescuing Shane from an unthinkably shitty party where he’d have been counting the seconds until he could get the hell out of there. Dogs are simply the best, and Finely’s all the proof we need to say it. Good girl!"
"Getting Out Of Hand: This Wedding Has Four Different Gourmet Hot Dog Stands, Two Photo Booths, An Army Recruiting Station, And Kids Tabling For A High School Anime Club",N/A,https://clickhole.com/getting-out-of-hand-this-wedding-has-four-different-gourmet-hot-dog-stands-two-photo-booths-an-army-recruiting-station-and-kids-tabling-for-a-high-school-anime-club/,"These days, there’s definitely pressure to make your wedding as fun for your guests as possible. However, in the case of these nuptials taking place in Charleston, SC, things are definitely getting out of hand: This wedding has four different gourmet hot dog stands, two photo booths, an army recruiting station, and kids tabling for a high school anime club. Alright, we’re definitely going overboard here. In a move that seriously misses how much stuff you need in order to keep 100 people entertained for an evening, newlyweds Nathaniel and Jane McManus have completely overloaded their wedding reception, renting out four hot dog stands when even just one would have even been overkill in light of the sit-down dinner and hors d’oeuvres hour, and two different photo booths, which are basically made irrelevant by the two professional photographers and three professional videographers walking around the venue.  As if there weren’t already more than enough to occupy the guests for the two and a half remaining hours of the wedding past the dinner and toasts, to the right of where the six-piece bluegrass band is playing (which is to the left of where the DJ is waiting for his turn), there are fully three soldiers in uniform asking every passing guest if they’ve ever thought about joining the Army—which is pretty odd, but honestly not as odd as the fact that there’s also a table being manned by five sophomores in Sailor Moon t-shirts advertising the anime club at the nearby Greg Mathis Charter High School.  You know the guests are just supposed to like, talk and dance, right? This isn’t a career fair. Although Nathaniel and Jane are clearly enjoying the festivities, and even spent a few minutes during one of the slow songs hitting up the Army booth themselves, it’s clear that the guests aren’t really sure what to make of the situation. Older relatives of the bride and groom keep approaching the high school anime club to ask how they’re related to the happy couple, before walking away with furrowed brows after the anime kids explain that they have no relation to the couple but can offer some suggestions of anime shows to check out instead. Good Lord.  Honestly, maybe this couple is secretly loaded and they had a ton of cash to burn, because otherwise this is just a gross overestimation of how much stuff you need going on at a wedding. Well… hats off the newly married couple anyway… "
"Compassion FTW: Instead Of Killing Animals, This Hunter Just Roughs Them Up A Bit And Steals Their Stuff",N/A,https://clickhole.com/compassion-ftw-instead-of-killing-animals-this-hunter-just-roughs-them-up-a-bit-and-steals-their-stuff/,"Hunting may be exciting, but it’s impossible to ignore the fact that it’s a cruel sport which treats living beings as if they are disposable. However, one kind-hearted hunter has found a way to practice his favorite hobby without causing any death at all: Instead of killing animals, he just roughs them up a bit and steals their stuff.  Beautiful! What a wonderful example of how to treat animals compassionately. Thirty-two-year-old plumber Magnus Erikson loves the thrill of matching his wits against animals in nature, but unlike most hunters, he can’t stand the idea of killing them. So when he heads into the woods after wild game, it looks a little different than a typical hunt. First off, he doesn’t bring a bow or a gun. He heads out to pursue rabbits, deer, turkeys, squirrels, elk, and more armed with nothing but his wits and a small satchel. Second off, he doesn’t aim to kill the animals, but just to rough them up enough to show them who’s boss, slap them around a little and shove them into a tree a couple of times. Finally, he’s not after their meat. He just wants their stuff.  “I could never take an innocent animal’s life, but I love to take their stuff,” explained Magnus. “So, if you’re an animal in my sights, you can rest assured that while you’re going to live to see another day, all of your stuff is going home with me. I’m gonna give you a couple of noogies and put my foot in your ass, maybe hit ya with a titty twister, and then I’m gonna take your acorn stash or your nest or whatever you’ve got and probably make you cry in the process. Your life is safe with me, but your stuff is mine now, bitch.” While most hunters fill their walls with gruesome trophies such as animal heads and pelts, Magnus does nothing of the sort. Instead, he displays the spoils he’s collected after dropping out of trees and emerging from bushes to dole out mild ass kickings to fuzzy critters and snag their stuff. Stashes of pinecones, large clutches of eggs, garbage, you name it. If an animal in the woods can own it, Magnus has forcibly stolen it from one. “This is a half-empty can of dog food I wrestled away from a raccoon,” said Magnus with pride as he showed off a gnawed-up Pedigree can on his fireplace mantel. “That raccoon really wanted to keep it, but after I tugged on its tail a couple times and spit in its face, it was all mine. I would never kill a raccoon, but I’ll gladly humiliate one in front of its family and pry its most prized possession from its claws and take it home for myself. To me, it’s a bigger thrill than murdering an animal could ever be.” What a thoughtful and sympathetic approach to what’s usually such a bloody, grim pastime.  While Magnus’ unique brand of hunting has yet to catch on, he hopes that more hunters will find it in their hearts to stop killing animals and just start beating them up and robbing them instead. Magnus is living proof that hunting can be a sport of compassion instead of cruelty, and that it can be more rewarding to power-bomb a wild turkey and steal its eggs than to end its life. It’s a beautiful thing. This world needs more hunters in the woods like Magnus."
Changing With The Times: This Family And Consumer Science Class Asks High Schoolers To Simulate Raising Two Pretty Fucked Up Shelter Dogs With Their Long-Term Boyfriend In A Very Small One Bedroom Apartment,N/A,https://clickhole.com/changing-with-the-times-this-family-and-consumer-science-class-asks-high-schoolers-to-simulate-raising-two-pretty-fucked-up-shelter-dogs-with-their-long-term-boyfriend-in-a-very-small-one-bedroom-apa/,"Traditionally, Family and Consumer Science classes teach students about the challenges of parenting by giving them a baby doll to care for as if it’s their own child. However, as our world has modernized, the classes have too, and that’s why this Family and Consumer Sciences class now asks high schoolers to simulate raising two pretty fucked up shelter dogs with their long-term boyfriend in a very small one bedroom apartment.  Awesome! This is definitely going to prepare students for life after high school! Rather than being asked to simulate marriage and child-rearing, students enrolled in Family and Consumer Sciences at Fairfield High School in New Jersey are first paired together in long-term partnerships (but not marriages, due to the issues with marriage’s patriarchal origins), before they’re given two stuffed dogs that are programmed with different, and often conflicting,  disabilities. Over a two-week period, each student will have to work with their partner to create a care schedule so that each dog gets its respective medicine, as giving the wrong dog the wrong medicine could potentially kill one or both of the dogs. The students will also be given a worksheet with the floor plan of a junior one-bedroom apartment that’s technically just a flex studio—meaning there’s no actual door to the bedroom. They will have to work together to decide how to arrange the furniture to create two separate desk nooks so that both partners can have enough privacy to do their work from home jobs, both of which involve several hours of Zoom calls per day. Additionally, the students will need to create two living spaces for the dogs, because although the shelter claimed otherwise, the dogs do not get along.  As the project comes to a close, the students will receive their final challenge on a school district-approved field trip. During the day-long simulation, one of the dogs will be “sick,” and the students will be bussed to a nearby veterinarian’s office. Once they’re at the office, the students will have to make a difficult choice: They will be asked to decide whether to try to do their jobs from their phones on the vet’s spotty wifi while sitting in the waiting room, or take a PTO day, even though doing so means they will have one day less to use during their upcoming over-budget trip to the Amalfi Coast to celebrate ten years with their partner. After this exercise, the students will return to school and engage in a reflection exercise with their Family and Consumer Science teacher, discussing what they learned about priorities and decision-making in the process. So cool! This is definitely going to give students a strong sense of the stresses and expectations of current adult life. Sound off below if you think all schools should have a class like this!"
"Mark Your Calendars: Astronomers Just Announced That This Month The Property Brothers Will Be In Perfect Alignment, Appearing As If A Single Property Brother",N/A,https://clickhole.com/mark-your-calendars-astronomers-just-announced-that-this-month-the-property-brothers-will-be-in-perfect-alignment-appearing-as-if-a-single-property-brother/,"Get ready to clear your calendars, because this historic event is one you won’t want to miss: Astronomers just announced that this month the Property Brothers will be in perfect alignment, appearing as if a single Property Brother.  Absolutely incredible. This is truly a once-in-a-lifetime sight to behold! According to NASA astronomers, later this month the world will bear witness to the first Total Property Brother Eclipse in decades, where one Property Brother will completely cover the other for around 4 to 6 minutes, resulting in the twin HGTV stars appearing as one to the naked eye. When the Property Brothers’ paths finally converge, people living in the Los Angeles County area will have an especially great view of Drew and Jonathan Scott’s alignment, as their trajectories are projected to meet somewhere along Melrose Avenue near Santa Monica. But don’t forget to be safe: NASA encourages those who plan to observe this amazing phenomenon to use protective eyewear, since staring directly at perfectly aligned Property Brothers can cause permanent blindness. Sadly, that unfortunate fate befell thousands of unaware brother-gazers in 1984, the last time Drew and Johnathan totally eclipsed.  Wow. Just wow. It doesn’t get cooler than this, does it? This awe-inspiring wonder is bound to bring so many people together. The Property Brothers aren’t expected to perfectly align again for another 50 years, so don’t miss your chance to see it while you can! "
Disturbing: Apparently One Person In This Family Is An Infant And Two Are The Parents But It’s Impossible To Tell Which,N/A,https://clickhole.com/disturbing-apparently-one-person-in-this-family-is-an-infant-and-two-are-the-parents-but-its-impossible-to-tell-which/,"Get ready for chills to run down your spine, because it doesn’t get more disturbing than this unsolvable real-life mystery: Apparently one person in this family is an infant and two are the parents, but it’s impossible to tell which.  Jesus Christ. This is not right. This is just not right at all.  At first glance, you probably noticed something peculiar about the Dority family, of Conway, New Hampshire. That’s because somehow, some way, one of the Doritys is an 8-month-old baby, and the other are two fully grown adults—a distinction that you simply cannot make with the naked eye alone. Usually, it’s quite easy to tell an infant apart from its parents, but that just isn’t the case here. Take a look at the Doritys below: if you didn’t know these three people were a family unit, you’d be forgiven for wondering whether you were looking at three adults, or three infants, or even two infants and one adult.   Any luck? Didn’t think so. Careful not to think yourself into an aneurysm trying to tell who’s the baby and who’s not. These people are a living optical illusion. One is in diapers and hasn’t said their first word yet…and the other two have jobs and are married…and it’s anyone’s guess as to who is who. Yikes. This would be fascinating if it weren’t so deeply upsetting.  You can only imagine how many times this family has gone out to a restaurant and had a waiter bring them three high chairs out of sheer confusion. Wow. Just when you feel you’ve got this family pegged, your brain begins to second guess itself until you’re scratching your head all over again. At the risk of sounding insensitive, there’s something going on genetically with this family, right? There has to be.  All we know is anyone who says they can tell baby Dority apart from Mom and Dad Dority is a liar. "
You Never Know What Someone’s Going Through: The Biggest Asshole You Know Is Privately Struggling With The Consequences Of Being A Huge Asshole,N/A,https://clickhole.com/you-never-know-what-someones-going-through-the-biggest-asshole-you-know-is-privately-struggling-with-the-consequences-of-being-a-huge-asshole/,"At the end of the day, we have to acknowledge that bullies are human too, and that their behavior is often explained by personal hardships they aren’t equipped to deal with. Case in point: The biggest asshole you know is privately struggling with the consequences of being a huge asshole.  Damn. Piece of shit or not, you kind of have to feel bad for the guy! Now, there’s no denying that you have good reason to hate this total dipshit: He’s barely tolerated among his own friends and family due to his penchant for making every interaction as unpleasant as humanly possible with his hostile, ignorant comments and aggressive personality. However, under his rough, reproachful exterior is a man dealing with an unimaginable pain—namely, the social repercussions of being a gigantic, cunt-faced dickhead who everyone agrees the world would be better off without. Day in and day out, this irredeemable jackass has to carry the burden of knowing that literally no one wants to associate with him because of the way he treats them.  Put yourself in his shoes: The poor guy has to live with the thought that everyone he meets can tell how much he fucking sucks within a minute of being around him, and not only that, but he also knows that if some misguided soul ever gives him a chance, he will without fail validate all the gossip they’ve heard about his unbearable personality after he inevitably makes one of the condescending remarks or unnecessary insults that he is incapable of curbing for even a moment. Hey, let he who wouldn’t turn into a detestable loser under those circumstances cast the first stone, y’know? Fostering a reputation as the biggest asshole of all time can’t be easy.  Unless you yourself have pushed away every person in your life due to your bad attitude, inability to maintain a relationship without burning bridges, and habit of weaponizing your fragile ego so that it prevents you from ever apologizing or admitting you’re wrong, it’s impossible to fathom what that’s like to live with.  You really just never know what someone’s going through. You really don’t.  Of course, this context does not excuse his being a miserable, contemptible motherfucker, but you can at least begin to empathize with the guy, understanding that the reason he is the way he is is because of the way he is. What’s so heartbreaking is that this vile asshat has developed such an unhealthy way to cope with the fallout of being an asshole to everyone all the time, as opposed to fostering a more productive response, such as not being an asshole to everyone all the time. All you can do is accept that everyone has their own way of handling adversity, and embrace the better angels of your nature by sympathizing the best you can with his struggle with being a world-class douchebag."
The Punishment Fits The Crime: This Toddler Who Picked Up A Bunch Of Bananas In Target Was Ordered By His Mother To Put It Back Right Now,N/A,https://clickhole.com/the-punishment-fits-the-crime-this-toddler-who-picked-up-a-bunch-of-bananas-in-target-was-ordered-by-his-mother-to-put-it-back-right-now/,"There’s nothing like seeing someone get the comeuppance they so richly deserve, and one budding kleptomaniac just paid a price that could not be better suited to match his offense: This toddler who picked up a bunch of bananas in Target was ordered by his mother to put it back right now. Boom. Justice is served, motherfucker! Three-year-old Jackson Cressler probably thought he’d hit the jackpot when he curiously waddled over to a display case of bananas at Target and picked an especially enticing bunch from the pile—bananas are Jackson’s favorite food, and they were the one produce display low enough for his stubby little arms and legs to reach. But his scheme came crashing down when his mother looked up from the pears she was checking for bruises to catch the fruit-snatching troublemaker in the act, and the judgment she delivered was as deliciously ironic as it was swift: instead of letting him keep his ill-gotten gains or simply levy some kind of light fine, Jackson’s mother laid down the law and demanded he immediately put the banana bunch back with his own two sticky-fingered hands and come sit in the cart where she could keep an eye on him. Not since the myths of the Greek underworld has a punishment been so perfectly tailored to the sins of a transgressor. For one thing, Jackson doesn’t get to eat any of the bananas now that he’s been ordered to put them back. He’ll have to watch them sit there just tantalizingly out of reach while his mom hunts through the grapefruit display to find the juicy ripe ones, the memory of the bananas’ pleasing heft in his arms slowly slipping away into the dim and irretrievable past while the bitter void of their absence swallows him whole. There’s also the devastating likelihood that another shopper will come by and put the bunch of bananas Jackson so coveted into their own cart instead, annihilating any last shreds of hope Jackson may have had that his mother would relent and let him pick up the bananas again. He can pout and whimper “‘nanas!” as much as he wants while pitifully waving his arms in their direction, but it won’t change a damn thing. He fucked up big-time picking up that bunch of bananas, and having to put it back right now is pretty much a flawless ending to this cautionary tale of short-sighted greed. Fuck around and find out, little dude. Karma’s a bitch! “Honey, Mommy just bought bananas for you yesterday, we don’t need more” said Jackson’s mom as she shot down his teary-eyed appeal to go back for the bananas, sticking firmly to her guns in a victory for every law-abiding citizen tired of seeing the rules that bind society so brazenly flouted. Honestly, he should have known she’d be running low on patience after his little stunt trying to eat some discarded french fries he found out in the Target’s parking lot, but some toddlers just want to watch the world burn, and the only way to rein in their chaotic impulses is to watch them like a hawk or put them up somewhere high where they can’t reach stuff. It’s nice to see this cheeky bastard getting his just deserts. Kudos to Jackson’s mom for bringing some good old-fashioned justice back to the grocery section of Target!"
Is He Supposed To Be A Role Model? This Therapist Keeps Asking You To Imagine What Sebastian The Crab From ‘The Little Mermaid’ Would Do In Your Situation,N/A,https://clickhole.com/is-he-supposed-to-be-a-role-model-this-therapist-keeps-asking-you-to-imagine-what-sebastian-the-crab-from-the-little-mermaid-would-do-in-your-situation/,"Therapy can be an effective tool for maintaining your mental wellness, but it’s never going to work if you don’t understand what the hell your therapist is saying. Unfortunately, just such a frustrating conversation is happening right now: This therapist keeps asking you to imagine what Sebastian the crab from The Little Mermaid would do in your situation.  Really? Sebastian? Pretty sure he’s just like a singing crab… really not much of an inspirational figure, let alone a paragon of mentally healthy behavior… After listening to your spiel about how you’ve been feeling disrespected by your roommate because you’ve noticed she’s been eating  your food without asking, your therapist, instead of offering any practical advice or asking follow-up questions, said, “And what do you think Sebastian the crab would do in a situation like that?” Understandably, you paused, then said, “You mean, like, Sebastion from The Little Mermaid?” to which your therapist nodded, before she nodded again as you responded “I don’t know?”  Okay, what? How the hell is this supposed to help you? It’s not like Sebastian saved the day in the movie or anything. Like, he was kinda a good friend to Ariel—he was definitely supportive—but not notably so? Confused, you moved on to discussing the boundaries you want to set with your parents and got pretty worked up in the process, but rather than tell you to take deep breaths to calm back down, your therapist merely said, “And how might Sebastian communicate his needs to his parents?” First of all, it was pretty bold of her to assume at that point that you were on board enough with the Sebastian line of questioning for her to address him just by first name, without even adding “the crab” or “the one from the mermaid movie” or anything. And furthermore, it was basically an impossible question given that as far as anyone knows, Sebastian doesn’t even have parents, let alone parents who insist on calling him three times a day like yours do. Still, your therapist tried to prompt you by adding “Do you think he would…ask his friend Ariel for advice?” as if you could possibly have any sense of how that question was intended to help, and who, if anyone, the redheaded mermaid-equivalent in your life was supposed to be. As you once again responded, “I don’t know,” your therapist nodded, this time adding, “I’d like you to reflect on that before our next session.” Next session? Lady, there might not be a next session if this deeply unhelpful shit about Sebastian the crab is all you can say! Because, by the way, even if you did know how Sebastian would respond to situations from your everyday life, which you don’t, are you supposed to do what he would do, or are you supposed to do the opposite?  Good Lord. An $85 copay for this? It might be time to give telehealth another shot, because this therapist is definitely not gonna make a dent in your issues. Mental health is such a difficult topic to tackle, and therapists like this are part of the reason that’s the case!"
‘Twizzlers Are Food’: The Main Selling Point Of Twizzlers’ New Campaign Is That They Are Food,N/A,https://clickhole.com/twizzlers-are-food-the-main-selling-point-of-twizzlers-new-campaign-is-that-they-are-food/,"Sometimes the best approach is the most straightforward, and an iconic American candy is retooling their message to hammer home the basics as directly as possible: The main selling point of Twizzlers’ new campaign is that they are food. We’ve gotta admit, “Twizzlers Are Food” does have a certain ring to it. Starting this week, billboards, buses, and televisions around the country will be lit up with Twizzlers’ new “Twizzlers Are Food” slogan in a multimillion-dollar ad blitz intended to educate consumers that Twizzlers are a thing you can eat that have a flavor and, if chewed and swallowed, will be processed by your digestive system in a manner consistent with food. The campaign is a marked departure from Twizzlers’ previous “The Twist You Can’t Resist” tagline, which marketers worried was too cerebral and didn’t emphasize Twizzlers food status enough to establish a subconscious link between “Twizzlers” and “food” in buyers’ minds. Twizzlers spends big money to make sure their product is a sort of food that contains calories and is broadly free of hazardous objects and inedible chemicals, so why wouldn’t they want an ad campaign that highlights how Twizzlers are food? “Right now when someone says ‘food,’ you probably think of an apple or a loaf of bread. Perhaps even a sumptuous roast turkey. But soon you’re gonna start thinking ‘Twizzlers!’ because as we say, ‘Twizzlers Are Food,’” said the company in a press release, adding that Twizzlers are a kind of candy, and candy is a kind of food, which according to the transitive property means that Twizzlers are inarguably food. “You can eat just a couple Twizzlers as a snack, or you can eat a whole bag of Twizzlers as a meal—the true beauty of food is that there are so many ways you can eat it. When people don’t eat food they die, but eating Twizzlers can keep you alive, because Twizzlers Are Food, and that’s a Twizzlers promise.” It’s hard to argue with a pitch like that! The ad campaign features endorsements from public figures like Selena Gomez, Kristen Bell, and DJ Khaled, all taking a big bite of Twizzlers and staring directly into the camera to announce that what you just saw was eating due to Twizzlers being food. And if you’re worried that nonstandard Twizzlers such as Chocolate Twizzlers and Twizzlers Filled Bites might not be food, you can breathe easy, because the extra long 90-second TV spots explain that being food is an intrinsic and immutable characteristic of all Twizzlers products that cannot be negated by variations in flavor or form. However, the ads also include the important disclaimer that even though you can bite the ends off of a Twizzler and use it as a straw to drink liquids like soda and milk, Twizzlers themselves are not liquids and therefore one should not attempt to drink them from a cup.  It’s gonna be hard for Twizzlers’ competitors to dispute their reasoning here. Kudos to Twizzlers for selling their product with a level of forthrightness rarely seen in advertising today! "
Cultural Melting Pot: These Girls From Ohio Are Talking To These Boys From Indiana At A Hotel Swimming Pool In Michigan,N/A,https://clickhole.com/cultural-melting-pot-these-girls-from-ohio-are-talking-to-these-boys-from-indiana-at-a-hotel-swimming-pool-in-michigan-jw/,"The American project has resulted in a beautiful melting pot of people from countless different walks of life, and never has this country’s rich cultural tapestry been more brightly on display than it is right now: These girls from Ohio are talking to these boys from Indiana at a hotel swimming pool in Michigan. Wow! It brings tears to our eyes to see two groups of people reaching out across the chasm of their differences to find common ground! Just ten minutes ago, a group of five girls from Beavercreek, Ohio sidled up to a trio of boys from Carmel, Indiana in the shallow end of the pool at the Grand Rapids, Michigan Holiday Inn, where both groups are staying during their respective softball and baseball tournaments, and the cultural exchange that has taken place since is nothing short of awe-inspiring. Though the girls first assumed that they wouldn’t want to associate with the “Indiana guys,” who were laughing at a meme related to an Indiana-specific standardized test called ILEARN that the girls had never heard of, it turned out that the groups were able to connect by sharing stories of their far-flung homes. The girls regaled the boys with a tale of Post-It noting teachers’ cars during Senior Prank Week, leading the boys to shock the girls with a story of the time they Post-It noted their principal’s office during a ceremony referred to in Carmel as Senior Wild Week. They continued from there to bring their two disparate milieus together, with the boys showing the girls pictures on their phones of the huge dead deer they saw on the side of I-69 during their journey to Michigan, and the girls showing the boys photos from the Starbucks on I-75 where the barista humorously misspelled the name on their coach on her cup. Soon the Indianans and Ohians were splashing, diving, and marveling together at the exotic Michigan locale they’d found themselves in, which had a regional restaurant chain called Arnie’s that none of them had heard of but hoped to sample. Despite the girls’ and boys’ different backgrounds, their conversation also brought up some shocking coincidences: As it turned out, one of the girls from Ohio was named Taylor, which two of the boys from Indiana were also named. Of course, they never would have discovered these shared threads of cultural cloth had they not had the courage to put aside their tribal loyalties, paddle over to one another in their PacSun swimsuits, and strike up a conversation with the “other,” creating a vibrant environment where borders dissolved and a shared sense of unity prevailed. And though the girls were soon off to warm up for the Davidson Softball Classic while the boys left to get ready for the Silver Series 16U Prospect Showcase, it’s not likely that they’ll soon forget the profound cross-cultural connection they forged in the chlorinated waters of the Holiday Inn.  Beautiful!  In a world that often feels divided, this heartwarming tale serves as a beacon of hope and a reminder that, in this country, extraordinary connections can happen anywhere, at any time, and between anyone. God bless the USA!"
They Are Far More Advanced Than We Realize: Scientists Have Discovered That Orcas Understand And Honor The Concept Of A Birthday Weekend,N/A,https://clickhole.com/they-are-far-more-advanced-than-we-realize-scientists-have-discovered-that-orcashumans-have-long-known-that-orcas-are-highly-advanced-creatures-with-profound-social-intelligence-but-new-research-sug/,"Humans have long known that orcas are highly advanced creatures with profound social intelligence, but new research suggests that they may even be more sophisticated than we realized: Scientists have discovered that orcas understand and honor the concept of a birthday weekend. Extraordinary! According to a paper published this week by marine biologists at the University of Oregon, orcas are able to not only acknowledge one another’s birthdays, but also block off the nearest Friday-through-Sunday for celebrations, fully understanding that they will be obligated to shower the birthday whale in attention for the entire weekend or else risk hurting their feelings.  “These animals have a keen understanding of the need to feel special on one’s birthday, and they dutifully go out of their way to celebrate fellow pod members’ birthdays for whole entire weekends, even though it’s kind of a big hassle and many of the orcas would much rather spend their Saturdays and Sundays on their own unwinding from the long week,” wrote lead researcher Leon Meyer, adding that there’s an implicit expectation among pod members to lavish birthday whales with celebratory fin bumps, extra seal meat, and gifts of shiny bits of litter for pretty much half of their birthday week. “We’ve long known orcas to be incredibly intelligent and social creatures, but not to the degree that they would know how to guilt their friends and loved ones into giving them gifts of kelp on their birthday, and then more kelp on the day after, and even more kelp on the following day, ultimately wringing three days of love and adulation out of what by all means should’ve just been a half-hour shindig on their actual birthday.”   Meyer and his team believe that the birthday weekend practice evolved out of the orcas’ natural desire for attention and love of gifts, much as humans developed our parallel practice. “Our research team observed orcas becoming visibly despondent the Mondays after their birthday weekends came to a close, displaying droopy fins, gloomily blowing bubbles, and even expressing their desolation through bleak groan-like vocalizations,” Meyer continued. “Like humans, they yearn to feel loved and appreciated to a sometimes unreasonable degree, especially when it’s their birthday. These incredible, party-loving creatures are more like us than we could’ve ever previously fathomed.” So fascinating! While there’s still a great deal we have yet to learn about orcas and their behaviors, it’s truly a delight knowing that these amazing creatures go out of their way to make their fellow pod members feel loved and cherished on their special days. Share if it inspires you knowing that these remarkable underwater giants celebrate birthday weekends the same way we do!"
Going Above And Beyond For Fans: Taylor Swift Will Now Pause Her Shows Whenever Anyone In The Audience Has To Use The Bathroom,N/A,https://clickhole.com/going-above-and-beyond-for-fans-taylor-swift-will-now-pause-her-shows-whenever-anyone-in-the-audience-has-to-use-the-bathroom/,"Ever wondered how Taylor Swift cultivated such a fiercely loyal fanbase? It’s because of gestures like this: Taylor Swift will now pause her shows whenever anyone in the audience has to use the bathroom.  Absolutely incredible. Literally no other artist goes out of their way for their fans like Taylor! Introduced recently on the Eras tour, Swifties no longer have to miss a moment of her performance in order to use the toilet, because now, any single member of the audience who needs a bathroom break can simply raise their hand, and Taylor will instantly stop her show until that person has finished and returned to their seat, no questions asked. While Taylor encourages her fans to use the bathroom before the show just in case, she’s abided her thoughtful new policy with nothing but grace and smiles, even as her recent concert in Pittsburgh passed the 52 hour mark. Whenever one of her fans felt the urge to relieve themselves, Taylor would simply put her guitar down, sit on the stage floor, and catch up on texts until the fan had done their business. This is such a classy move to honor the fans who pay hundreds of dollars for tickets, since literally no one can say they missed their favorite Taylor song due to drinking too many White Claws. Even if she’s right in the middle of one her biggest hits, Taylor promises to keep a vigilant eye on the fans in the stadium and stop playing the very second someone raises their hand and shouts, “I have to use the toilet,” only to pick up in the exact place she left off once that person’s done emptying their bladder and/or bowels. Name another musician willing to do this for their fans…we’re waiting! Whether you’re a die-hard Swiftie or don’t listen to her music at all, you simply have to admire the respect that Taylor Swift’s showing to her fans. Other musicians take note: Taylor’s just raised the bar for recognizing that concertgoers sometimes have to urinate!"
Giving Back: The Beeps And Flatline Sounds On This Children’s Hospital’s Heart Rate Monitors Will Now Be Voiced By Julian Casablancas,N/A,https://clickhole.com/giving-back-the-beeps-and-flatline-sounds-on-this-childrens-hospitals-heart-rate-monitors-will-now-be-voiced-by-julian-casablancas/,"More often than not, it’s rock stars’ bad behavior that lands them in the news, but here’s a story that flips the script, involving one of the world’s biggest rock stars who, apparently, also has one of the world’s biggest hearts: Julian Casablancas will now be voicing the beeps and flatline sounds of the heart rate monitors at a children’s hospital.  What an incredibly beautiful way to brighten those kids’ day! Hats off to you, Julian! As of this morning, every pulse-monitoring machine at Hassenfeld Children’s Hospital at NYU Langone has been reprogrammed to emit the croons of The Strokes’ frontman instead of their usual clinical electronic tones. Sources at Hassenfeld say that Casablancas offered his raspy timbre free of charge to the pediatric medical center, and ultimately recorded several dozen varieties of soulful beeps and alerts in his signature slurred baritone, throwing in the occasional enigmatic lyric, such as, “beep…beep…dreams of you in the city, ohhh…beep.” Now, these terminally ill children’s hospital stays can be a little less scary knowing their pulse is being voiced by a living rock legend and that Julian’s soaring melodies will be the last thing they ever hear as they flatline.  How awesome is this?!? Without a doubt, this is the coolest children’s hospital in the world. It just doesn’t get more generous than this. All celebrities should take note, because Julian Casablancas just raised the bar for how to use one’s talent for a good cause. Props to Hassenfeld Children’s Hospital and Julian for bringing joy to kids at the time they need it most!"
The Perils Of AI Technology: Scientists Have Announced That By 2045 Toasters Will Be Able To Shoot The Toast At You ,N/A,https://clickhole.com/the-perils-of-ai-technology-scientists-have-announced-that-by-2045-toasters-will-be-able-to-shoot-the-toast-at-you/,"As AI technology continues to advance explosively with little foresight or regulation, it’s easy to imagine an apocalyptic tipping point where AI attempts to wipe out humanity. And if new research is to be believed, this sort of doomsday scenario is now a very real risk: Scientists have announced that by 2045 toasters will be able to shoot the toast out at you. Dear God. Hold onto your butter knives, folks, because the future of breakfast just got much more dangerous. The alarming revelation follows a grim new study from AI researchers at Princeton University, who, using cutting-edge predictive models and highly accurate simulations to forecast technological progression, have determined that toasters will likely be able to launch toast directly into the faces of unsuspecting users within the next few decades. As appliance manufacturers continue incorporating smart technologies into products, researchers warn that toasters will become exponentially more capable and autonomous, ultimately putting humans at grave risk of getting doinked in the head by very warm toast, potentially leading to minor abrasions or—even worse—crumbs all over the place.     While some may dismiss the idea as science fiction, researchers say there’s a nearly 80 percent probability of AI-driven toaster attacks by the middle of the century, and they’re urging toaster manufacturers and government agencies to immediately coordinate on developing safeguards to thwart a future where people are regularly being blasted in the eye by piping-hot slices of Brownberry Oatnut. Some potential solutions are already being explored, such as toast-deflecting kevlar helmets, integrated nets that deploy at lighting speed to intercept launched toast, and even specialized safety bread with large baked-in air pockets that produce a parachute effect, halting the trajectory of airborne bread so that it gently floats back down to one’s plate. However, such solutions would need to be implemented in an estimated 123 million households in the U.S. alone to truly mitigate the risk of toasters blasting crispy bread shuriken-like at humans, which would require a massive and costly national effort of unprecedented scale.    
Absolutely horrifying.   Is this it? Has humanity created the tools that will eventually be responsible for our own doom? In light of this news, it really appears as if we’ve taken the first steps down the path to our extinction. Here’s hoping a solution can be found before it’s too late. And in the meantime, it might be wise to keep an eye on your toaster and approach the breakfast table with caution. The future of toast, it seems, is not as innocuous as we once thought."
Incredibly Compassionate: This Man Would Totally Adopt This Disabled Dog That’s About To Get Euthanized By His Local Kill Shelter If He Wanted To,N/A,https://clickhole.com/incredibly-compassionate-this-man-would-totally-adopt-this-disabled-dog-thats-about-to-get-euthanized-by-his-local-kill-shelter-if-he-wanted-to/,"Sometimes it can seem like the world is a cold, uncaring place where people only act in their own self-interest. But when all of humanity seems irredeemable, all it takes is one story like this to remind us that there is still good in the world: This man would totally adopt this disabled dog that’s about to get euthanized by his local kill shelter if he wanted to.  Awwwwww! This, folks, is what compassion looks like.  When 32-year-old marketing analyst Jerome Ludwig saw a Facebook post pleading to find a home for Chubby, a 12-year-old Staffordshire mix with one eye and persistent incontinence issues, his heart was immediately broken. “Chubby only has a few days left before the assholes at the shelter kill him to make room for more unwanted animals,” wrote Jerome when he shared the post. “I wish I could adopt the poor guy so he doesn’t have to live out his last days in a crowded shelter, but unfortunately I don’t want to. If I did, I would 100% love to give him a forever home. But again, I just don’t feel like it.”  Seeing photos of Chubby’s goopy eye socket and leaky rectum absolutely broke Jerome’s heart, and as someone with a vast fenced-in yard, a stable full-time job, and ample free time for walks and playing, his circumstances are pretty much ideal for taking in a pet in need of a home, if he were so inclined to do so. Yet as badly as he wishes he could convince himself to want to adopt an elderly disabled dog with costly medical and dietary needs, Jerome’s deep compassion is sadly outweighed by his overall contentedness with his comfortable, generally burden-free lifestyle, which unfortunately is incompatible with having to worry about a gross, old, sick dog all the time. But if there was any way he could adopt Chubby without any inconvenience or having to put forth any real effort, he’d be at the shelter in a heartbeat. In response to his Facebook post, many of Jerome’s friends applauded his willingness to contemplate taking Chubby into his home, with several mentioning that they, too, wish they could adopt the dog but unfortunately could not due to reasons they didn’t specify. But it’s nonetheless heartwarming to see so many people showing genuine, hypothetical compassion for an animal in need.   See? There is still plenty of good in the world.  With so many stories of murderers and criminals in the news every day, it’s important to amplify stories about people like Jerome who would save an animal from certain death if they had literally any motivation to do so. Thank you, Jerome, for making us all a little less cynical and for being a light in a dark world. "
A Productive Weekend: NASA Just Power-Washed And Refinished The Moon,N/A,https://clickhole.com/a-productive-weekend-nasa-just-power-washed-and-refinished-the-moon/,"Spring is a great time to get around to doing outdoor chores, whether in the backyard or, as one government agency just demonstrated, even in outer space. Yep, that’s right: NASA has power washed and refinished the moon! Fantastic! The moon is looking so much better now! In a series of social media posts today, NASA has been urging people to gaze up at the night sky to behold the dazzling results of a recent lunar mission in which the moon’s surface was buffed, cleaned, and beautifully re-stained. Officials at NASA noticed last week that the moon was looking “not so hot” and “pretty crusty,” prompting the agency to rent a power-washer from Home Depot, strap it to a rocket, and commence a weekend-long cleanup project. Astronauts blasted millennia of accumulated dust and debris off the moon with the power-washer and then sanded down many of the more unsightly craters before finally applying an attractive walnut stain to enhance its natural shine and provide protection against dirty cosmic particles and regular wear-and-tear. The result? A squeaky-clean moon, free of stubborn stains and blemishes, whose sheen is now brighter and more captivating than ever before.  Beautiful! It just goes to show how a little bit of elbow grease can go a long way. With summer just around the corner, we’re looking forward to many warm nights basking beneath the glossy glow of our newly polished celestial companion. Kudos to NASA for giving the ol’ gal a much-needed scrubbing—the hard work really paid off."
Dad’s Not Gonna Like This: Mom Is Caught In A Rip Tide,N/A,https://clickhole.com/dads-not-gonna-like-this-mom-is-caught-in-a-rip-tide/,"If you want to catch Dad in a good mood, you’d better act fast, because some unfortunate if not unexpected news is about to make the old man pitch a fit: Mom is caught in a rip tide. Goddammit, Mom. She should know by now that imperiling herself in hazardous ocean currents really pushes Dad’s buttons! In the five minutes since Dad wandered off to hit up the beach’s public restrooms, Mom has somehow managed to go from quietly reading her latest Donna Leon mystery novel on the sand to frantically struggling for dear life as a powerful rip tide sweeps her out to sea. This isn’t just some half-assed baby rip tide, either—we pretty much blinked and Mom was already a flailing little dot on the horizon, way out of earshot for us to tell her she should swim horizontally out of the water’s flow so Dad won’t flip his shit that she’s exhausting herself trying to fight current directly. It was also nominally Mom’s job to watch our valuables while Dad went to drain the dragon, so now he’s gonna be doubly steamed to find that she left the bag with our phones and wallets just sitting there unprotected so coastal water phenomena could yeet her halfway to Portugal instead. While we’re not half as ticked as Dad’s about to be, we’re still pretty disappointed that Mom would pull her typical “Mom requires emergency services” drama on our nice day at the beach. All she had to do was not get caught in a rip tide for another hour or so and we probably could have talked Dad into getting lobster rolls and raspberry lime rickeys at the great clam shack just up the road. Mom’s always talking about how she could go for a nice pint of fried clams in the summer, and then when that’s finally within reach she goes and enters a current so forceful that her best front crawl ends up looking like the aquatic version of moonwalking. Even if the lifeguards manage to bring her back alive, Dad’s going to insist on heading straight home while making all sorts of passive-aggressive cracks about Mom needing to check the bathroom for rip tides before she takes a shower. And God help us if the love of Dad’s life drowns, because the geezer’s liable to blow a gasket so bad that his freakout when we dented his Mazda back in high school will look like a Mister Rogers episode in comparison. Might as well hop in the rip tide ourselves to dodge the Category 5 shitstorm that’s coming. Look, we recognize that Dad’s not blameless here. He was the one who decided to set up our towels directly in front of the rip tide because “the water looks less choppy here,” (pretty much the first red flag they teach you in Rip Tide 101) and he also rushed Mom past the rip tide safety sign she was trying to read at the parking lot because he wanted to get at the sandwiches in the cooler she was carrying. We personally regret taking our eyes off Mom long enough for this to go down too, though in our defense, we were busy trying to keep seagulls away from the kettle chips Dad left unattended when he went to piss. But still, would it really have killed Mom to just walk the beach a bit if she was getting restless? She knows how disaster-prone she is! Welp, here comes Dad wearing the last smile we’ll see on him for the rest of the day. Here’s hoping Mom lives and learns some real lessons about not causing the kind of emergencies that get under Dad’s skin!"
Sad: This Understaffed Middle School’s Sex Ed Classes Are Taught By A Big Mouth Billy Bass Toy That’s Been Reprogrammed To Explain Menstruation,N/A,https://clickhole.com/sad-this-understaffed-middle-schools-sex-ed-classes-are-taught-by-a-big-mouth-billy-bass-toy-thats-been-reprogrammed-to-explain-menstruation/,"If you needed any proof that public education is sorely underfunded in this country, look no further: This understaffed middle school’s sex ed classes are taught by a Big Mouth Billy Bass toy that’s been reprogrammed to explain menstruation.  Absolutely shameful. Our kids deserve so much better! With no room left in their threadbare budget to hire a qualified instructor, administrators at Farnsley Middle School in Shively, Kentucky, were recently left with no choice but to leave the sex ed curriculum in the hands—or fins, rather—of a modified Big Mouth Billy Bass, which flaps around and explains the menstrual cycle in 60-second increments before shutting off, requiring a student to press its button to make it start again. As if not having an actual certified instructor to ask questions about sensitive sexual matters wasn’t bad enough, the animatronic fish’s lessons are frequently undermined by lingering aspects of its original programming, such as its silly dance moves and its propensity towards loudly belting out Al Green’s “Take Me To The River” at random times without warning.  But it gets worse. The singing bass’s tinny voice still makes references to fishing in its explanations of the female reproductive system, such as recommending that those with a heavier flow “keep extra tampons in their tackle box,” or how “if no sperm takes the bait and fertilization doesn’t occur, the female body reels in her lure, sheds its old uterine lining, and prepares to cast off again.” This chaotic jumble of terminologies has proven to be incredibly confusing for some students, who, left with the impression that reproductive functions and fish are somehow related, might now grow up dangerously ill-informed about their own bodies. Administrators at the school are aware of this issue, but unfortunately, according to the principal, they “literally have no idea how to fix it and can’t afford to hire anyone who does.” What a damning indictment of the state of public education in the U.S.! These poor kids. Hopefully they’ll somehow be able to receive some clearer, more accurate information about sexual health to supplement the lessons taught by the Big Mouth Billy Bass, and hopefully lawmakers will start fighting for more funding for schools like this one before core subjects like math, science, and history end up getting taught by reprogrammed singing fish, too.

Awkward: All Of The Parents At This Child’s 6th Birthday Party Can Feel The Sexual Tension Between The Birthday Girls’s Mom And The Party Clown She Hired,N/A,https://clickhole.com/awkward-all-of-the-parents-at-this-childs-6th-birthday-party-can-feel-the-sexual-tension-between-the-birthday-girlss-mom-and-the-party-clown-she-hired/,"Experiencing a sexual connection can be a wonderful thing, but it’s not really something everyone else needs to be aware of. Case in point: All of the parents at this child’s 6th birthday party can feel the sexual tension between the birthday girl’s mom and the party clown she hired. Good Lord.  From the moment Pokey the Clown arrived in Judy Wanamaker’s backyard and was greeted with an overly long hug from Judy, it was clear that there was definitely something between the two. Judy then remarked that Pokey looked “even cuter IRL than on the photos on his website,” an especially bizarre comment to make to someone wearing a full face of paint and a crazy rainbow wig. Later, as Pokey began his routine in honor of Judy’s daughter Julia’s birthday, no one—not any of the dozen kids in attendance—laughed harder or louder at his pratfalls and gags than Judy. He’s just accidentally spraying himself in the face with water, Judy. It’s not that funny. In an action that signaled that Judy’s interest was, in fact, reciprocated, when Pokey asked for a volunteer, instead of choosing any of the children who raised their hand, he chose Judy. As Judy proceeded to pull a long line of hankies out of Pokey’s mouth, she squealed “Oh Pokey! It’s so much longer than I thought!” proving that the situation was as hot for them as it was cringeworthy for everyone watching. Yuck. Just yuck. After his act was over, Pokey set up shop in the corner of the yard to make balloon animals, and  it probably goes without saying that Judy was first in line. As he twisted the balloon, Judy kept grabbing Pokey’s shoulder while making comments like, “Wow, is there anything your hands can’t do, Pokey?” Then, when he handed her the completed balloon, she exclaimed, “A giraffe? How’d you know that’s my favorite?” to which Pokey said, “Just a hunch,” with a sly smile and flirty honk of the bicycle horn affixed to his shirt that repulsed everyone who had the misfortune of standing close enough to see it. Does anyone have a knife? Because you could definitely cut this sexual tension with it. So much ew. It’s definitely for the best that Judy only booked Pokey for 90 minutes, because this is getting unbearable for everyone else in attendance. "
Something For Everyone: Nerf Is Releasing A Conscientious Objector Certification For Kids Who Are Too Sensitive To Participate In A Nerf War,N/A,https://clickhole.com/something-for-everyone-nerf-is-releasing-a-conscientious-objector-certification-for-kids-who-are-too-sensitive-to-participate-in-a-nerf-war/,"No child ever wants to feel left out of the game their friends are playing, and thankfully a major toymaker is expanding their lineup so everyone can have fun in their own way: Nerf is releasing a conscientious objector certification for kids who are too sensitive to participate in a Nerf war. Wow, we wish they’d had this when we were growing up! While plenty of kids love letting the foam fly in an all-out Nerf war, other more delicate kids may view the act of raising a dart blaster against another human being as fundamentally at odds with their own ethical understanding of the universe. In less enlightened times, these sensitive, live theater-enjoying kids would be branded wusses or total dorks for their refusal to unload a 15-dart clip into their shriek-laughing classmate Mason, or worse, be forced to put their own moral well-being at hazard by reluctantly pelting Mason with darts even though they find Nerf wars scary and overstimulating. But thanks to the new Nerf Conscientious Objector Certifications rolling out this summer, these dart blaster-averse kids can at last exempt themselves with dignity while they go into another room to watch baseball with their friend’s dad until everybody else gets tired enough to want to order Domino’s or watch Minecraft tutorials on YouTube. Kids seeking the Nerf Conscientious Objector Certification will undergo a thorough application process to prove that their aversion to high-octane dart-blasting mayhem is grounded in a sincere belief that it’s nicer to collect dandelions for make-believe wizard potions or build little havens for caterpillars out of twigs, and not just a matter of convenience. For instance, a child who was happily potshotting his buddy Cody with a Nerf Alpha Strike Boa RC-6 would not be able to suddenly claim conscientious objector status just because his six-dart rotating drum had run dry and Cody was about to light his ass up with a fully motorized Nerf Elite Titan CS-50’s rapid-fire 50-dart barrage. But a timid child who loves reading and practicing drawing cartoon characters who would probably just ruin the whole Nerf war by crying the second somebody so much as grazes his shoulder? That child would be approved to receive Nerf 1-A-O Conscientious Objector papers he could then display to the other kids, who would appreciate that he’s indirectly assisting the Nerf war effort by not putting himself in a situation where he hyperventilates and freaks out so bad that somebody’s parent goes and shuts the whole Nerf war down for all of them. What a cool idea. We hope Nerf sells a ton of these! “We’re always trying to tweak our blasters to strike faster and shoot farther, but this innovative addition to our product line is here to bring Nerf to the sensitive kids who would rather forgo blasting entirely to twirl around the yard with a bubble wand,” said Hasbro in a press release, adding that they’d consulted dozens of real-life conscientious objectors to make their paperwork feel as authentic as possible. “Not every kid wants to hear the whistle of a Nerf Mega XL dart sailing above their head as they scramble to reach cover and unleash a pump-action airblitz salvo of their own, and we respect their right to go off and work on a 1,000-piece Frozen 2 jigsaw puzzle instead. Now they can finally live by their beliefs and purchase a Nerf product that accommodates their personal refusal to participate in simulated combat, allowing them to engage in gentle activities better suited to their comfort levels, such as make-believing they’re jungle animals or quietly solving logic puzzles in Brain Quest books.” It’s great that Nerf’s open to shaking things up like this. Here’s hoping more toy companies will find ways to give sensitive kids an out from the games they find loud and upsetting! "
Did Sesame Street Go Too Far With The Episode Where Elmo Stayed Friends With Grover After Allegations That Grover Was In A Manipulative Age-Gap Relationship To Teach Kids That Cancel Culture Has Its Gray Areas?,N/A,https://clickhole.com/did-sesame-street-go-too-far-with-the-episode-where-elmo-stayed-friends-with-grover-after-allegations-that-grover-was-in-a-manipulative-age-gap-relationship-to-teach-kids-that-cancel-culture-has-its-g/,"Parents have long trusted Sesame Street to teach their kids about important social issues with grace and nuance, but some are upset about a recent episode of the show: Do you think Sesame Street went too far with the episode where Elmo stayed friends with Grover after allegations that Grover was in a manipulative age-gap relationship to teach kids that cancel culture has its gray areas? Hundreds of disgruntled parents have taken to social media this week to complain about a recent segment on the show where Elmo spent the day hanging out with Grover despite the fact that 37-year-old Grover had just days earlier gotten in trouble with the Sesame Street gang for allegedly mistreating his 21-year-old ex-girlfriend, a Muppet named Miss Gigi. The start of the episode seemed to suggest that this relationship was highly inappropriate, as evidenced by the Count’s song about the number 16, in which he explained that “A 16-year gap is too big / Grover is a creepy pig / We don’t like him anymore / Put him in jail and lock the door!” But later on, Elmo was seen sampling taco salad with Grover at Cookie Monster’s food truck, where he explained, “Elmo loves his friend Grover even though Grover had a dicey relationship! Elmo thinks it’s maybe not so black and white—maybe Grover is old enough to make better decisions, but Grover is not a predator! Elmo is not afraid to be seen with Grover in public!” Elmo’s thoughts on the matter sharply diverged from the other characters on Sesame Street, who shunned Grover and called out his toxic behavior. In one scene, Snuffleupagus accused Grover of gaslighting Miss Gigi into performing a square dance with him in a previous episode, suggesting that Grover liked dating younger Muppets because he could easily manipulate them into doing things with him like making up dances and learning about multiplication. However, Elmo remained by Grover’s side, even inviting him over for an Elmo’s World segment in which the two talked to Mr. Noodle about how friendships can endure even when one friend does not necessarily approve of all the other friend’s actions. And when, in a later segment, a child visiting Sesame Street asked Elmo, “Why do you still hang out with Grover? I heard he asked out Miss Gigi while she was a student in his drawing class, which is kind of weird,” Elmo simply responded, “Elmo thinks it’s a little weird too, but Elmo believes Grover is a good friend at heart.” It definitely gives you a lot to think about! Sesame Street has since defended their decision to air the episode, noting that it’s crucial to expose children to the idea that friendships can be complicated and that some things in life aren’t always as straightforward as they seem. However, it seems that many parents are still enraged and believe that Elmo should have cut Grover out as soon as he heard about Grover’s morally questionable relationship. What do you think? Did the episode go too far, or do you believe it taught a valuable lesson? Let us know in the comments! "
"Real Life Pygmalion: A Kindly Linguistics Professor Has Taken In Bhad Bhabie, Given Her A Huge Feathered Hat, And Taught Her How To Comport Herself In High Society!",N/A,https://clickhole.com/real-life-pygmalion-a-kindly-linguistics-professor-has-taken-in-bhad-bhabie-given-her-a-huge-feathered-hat-and-taught-her-how-to-comport-herself-in-high-society/,"If you’ve ever been swept away by the relationship between Eliza Dolittle and Henry Higgins in the George Bernard Shaw play Pygmalion, you’ll want to read this similar and equally heartwarming story currently taking place in modern-day Los Angeles: A kindly linguistics professor has taken in Bhad Bhabie, given her a huge feathered hat, and taught her how to comport herself in high society. Fascinating! It seems we have something of a My Fair Bhad Bhabie on our hands! Linguistics professor Gregory Whitford of UCLA was strolling the streets of Hollywood this week when he came across the entourage of Bhad Bhabie, the teenage sensation whose journey into the limelight began with her infamous catchphrase “Cash Me Ousside,” and he instantly became entranced by the young white woman’s highly unusual accent as she mumbled about how she was “prolly gonna smack up on some hoes” later on that day. Whitford introduced himself to Bhad Bhabie and hypothesized that he could turn her into a gentlewoman within a fortnight—an offer which Bhad Bhabie reluctantly accepted by giving Whitford the finger and drawling “fine, bitch.” Realizing he had his work cut out for him, Whitford quickly dressed Bhad Bhabie in a feathered hat and floor length gown, and then set about teaching her to recite the phrase “Betwixt the twine and twisted vine, a surreptitious sun shall shine.” Though she at first resisted by scrolling Instagram and loudly clicking her fingernails on her phone, Bhad Bhabie soon tried in earnest to complete elocution exercise, struggling late into the night to say “betwixt” rather than “tishhh” and “twine” rather than “ho.” It seems he is indeed turning her from whatever she is currently into a lady! When Bhad Bhabie finally mastered her diction, Whitford took her to a high-class fête at another professor’s home, where she impressed everyone around her by regaling them with a perfectly enunciated story about the time she “fucked up Dr. Phil’s bitch-ass on TV.” And even as Bhad Bhabie has herself transformed, she has helped the reticent, cold-hearted Whitford come out of his shell, too, encouraging him to appear in her “get ready with me TikToks” and even threatening that fellow UCLA professors who express differing linguistic theories than him will “catch these hands.” Still, there has been some friction between the two: When Whitford kept Bhad Bhabie up past midnight studying tongue placement diagrams to improve her pronunciation, Bhad Bhabie became aggravated, calling him a “broke bitch” and threatening to take him on Dr. Phil so “that bald ho can handle [him].” Wow! While Bhad Bhabie’s transformative journey hasn’t been without its challenges, it nonetheless proves that anybody, no matter how rough around the edges, can rise above their flaws and become an elegant, sophisticated individual—some might just need a little more guidance than others. Here’s hoping she continues making progress and one day stops yelling angrily about Dr. Phil altogether!"
"Um, Great: Entomologists Have Admitted That They, Too, Have No Idea If Moths Are A Cute Bug You’re Supposed To Be Careful Not To Hurt Or A Gross Bug You Can Smush ",N/A,https://clickhole.com/um-great-entomologists-have-admitted-that-they-too-have-no-idea-if-moths-are-a-cute-bug-youre-supposed-to-be-careful-not-to-hurt-or-a-gross-bug-you-can-smush/,"Normally when we have questions about science that are outside our comprehension, we can turn to experts in the field for guidance, but here’s a case where the so-called “experts” are just as clueless as we are: Entomologists have admitted that they, too, have no idea if moths are a cute bug you’re supposed to be careful not to hurt or a gross bug you can smush. Well, that’s not helpful at all. Thanks for nothing, bug nerds.  The Entomological Society of America released a press release today stating, “The number one question we as entomologists get asked is whether moths are gross bugs like roaches that should be squashed with the bottom of a flip flop or beautiful bugs like butterflies that should be approached with gentle admiration. We honestly have no idea. Moths have the same kind of wings as butterflies, but the wings are usually grayish-brown and kind of gross-looking, making it unclear whether you should be delighted or skeeved out if one lands on your finger. They flutter around in the same graceful way as butterflies, but they tend to do so in swarms around lights at nighttime, which is a bit unnerving and sort of makes you think, This is a bug that should die. So it’s a toss up.” The press release went on to say, “Look at it this way: If you get a tattoo of a butterfly or a bee it’s clear that it’s meant to evoke natural beauty, and if you get a tattoo of a spider or a centipede it’s obviously supposed to be spooky and gross. But a moth tattoo? Could go either way. The fact is that moths occupy a peculiar place in the insect hierarchy, straddling the line between beauty and revulsion, and we currently have no tests or measurements to determine if we should be burning them with Bic lighters like wood ticks or putting them in jars to display like lightning bugs. It is one of the greatest mysteries of the insect world.” Hmm, we really don’t know what to think here.  With entomologists admitting they have no idea whether we should be treating moths like cuddly little friends or blood-sucking pests, we guess we really don’t have anywhere else to turn for answers. We’ll just have to continue on as we have been, making arbitrary judgements on a moth-by-moth basis, smushing some and admiring others. It’s not ideal, but seems like it’ll have to do for now."
Heartbreaking: Clint Eastwood Is Trying To Make Himself Have Cleavage In The Mirror But Can’t,N/A,https://clickhole.com/heartbreaking-clint-eastwood-is-trying-to-make-himself-have-cleavage-in-the-mirror-but-cant/,"Our hearts are heavy with secondhand disappointment today, because a Hollywood icon is struggling to come to terms with a dream he just doesn’t have the goods to fulfill: Clint Eastwood is trying to make himself have cleavage in the mirror but can’t. Poor fella’s great at a lot of things, but having cleavage just ain’t one of ‘em. Eastwood has spent the last three hours rooted in front of his bedroom mirror desperately trying to manipulate his bare chest into something resembling cleavage, but no matter how the acclaimed actor-cum-director shifts and squeezes his wafer-thin pectorals, the alluring crevasse of plump décolletage remains agonizingly out of his reach. Whether he tries squishing his meager flaps in from the sides, scooping them up from the bottom, or even hunching his entire body forward to cluster his chest flesh as tightly as possible, the result remains sadly the same: a flat, scrawny ribcage with nary a heaving milker in sight, much less the two required for cleavage. “C’mon, have cleavage you bee-sting-titted little twerp,” he just muttered to himself, his trademark scowl betraying deep pain and self-loathing over his less-than-ample bosom. “Show me those breasts. I know they’re in there somewhere. It’s booby time for Clint.” Eastwood’s really giving himself a hard time about his non-existent rack. He keeps calling himself names like Flatty Harry and The Man With No Tits, and every 10 minutes or so he’ll get so frustrated that he just open-palm slaps his paltry mosquito bites as if to rebuke them for being so uncooperatively tiny. He’s even pulled up an empty chair beside him that he’s started addressing as though it represents Barack Obama, who’s apparently flaunting his own bodacious cleavage in a plunging V-neck sweater. “You must be so proud of yourself sitting there with those cannonballs smushed against each other,” sneered Eastwood just now, upper lip quivering as he forlornly brought his elbows together in vain. “Well you know what? You should be. You’ve got cleavage that could drown a fella tryin’ to motorboat it, and I’m standing here like a jackass too chickenshit to accept that he belongs on the Itty-Bitty Titty Committee. You think that’s amusing? Does it delight you knowing that your pillowy rack sprays milk by the gallon, yet these ol’ nips of mine give me nothing but dust? Wipe that smirk off your face, commie. There’s nothing funny about this.” Man, it’s really bumming us out to see him so upset. At nearly 93 years old, Eastwood’s likely all too aware that he may never see his reflection present eye-popping cleavage if he can’t make it happen now. A younger Eastwood could have tried changing up his diet and busting out some bench presses to give himself more chest to work with, but at this age that kind of exertion could very well kill him. Then again, considering the obvious toll his current flatness is taking on him, we wonder if it isn’t already a foregone conclusion that his single-minded pursuit of cleavage will put him in the grave no matter what he ends up doing. Guess it’s just human nature to want the things you don’t have. Here’s hoping Clint Eastwood can stop crying macho over his A-cups and realize that winning four Oscars is just as worthy an achievement as being able to make yourself have cleavage in the mirror!"
‘We Just Wanted People To Know What True Love Looks Like’: An Oral History Of Gawker’s Hulk Hogan Sex Tape Controversy,N/A,https://clickhole.com/we-just-wanted-people-to-know-what-true-love-looks-like-an-oral-history-of-gawkers-hulk-hogan-sex-tape-controversy/,"In October 2012, a two-minute excerpt from a six-year-old sex tape featuring Terry Gene Bollea, professionally known as Hulk Hogan, and Heather Clem, wife of radio personality Bubba the Love Sponge Clem, was published on the celebrity gossip site Gawker. The clip featured only 10 seconds of explicit sexual material, but the aftermath of its publication would reverberate for years to come, forever changing the rules of the internet and the boundaries of free speech. This is the oral history of Gawker’s Hulk Hogan sex tape controversy.  A.J. Daulerio (Former editor-in-chief, Gawker): In May of 2012, I received an envelope in the mail with no return address. Inside was a sheet of paper with the word “WINDMILL” written on it in purple marker and nothing else. I walked to the nearest windmill and there was a cow inside. Strangled to death. I sat there for a while trying to figure out who could be strong enough to strangle a cow, because their throats are very hard to squish. The only guy who came to mind was Hulk Hogan, the strongest and blondest man on earth. Clearly this was meant to be a clue, but what did it mean? Bubba the Love Sponge Clem (Radio personality, husband of Heather Clem): I was trying to tip off Gawker that I had a sex tape of my wife and the Hulkster getting it, but I didn’t want them to know the tape was coming from me. So I taped it to the wall in a Burger King behind a framed photo of some onion rings and left a trail of clues involving windmills and cows.  A.J. Daulerio: Later that day I was coincidentally stealing a framed poster of onion rings from a local Burger King to decorate my condo and a DVD-R disc fell out from behind it. Written in Sharpie on the disc were the words “TRUE LOVE.” I was immediately intrigued. So I went back to my condo, hung the onion rings artwork over my fireplace, and popped the disc in.  Leonard Maltin (Film critic): Prior to the Hulk Hogan sex tape, celebrity sex tapes had been crude, grainy, barely arousing affairs that really just made you feel ashamed for even watching them. Honestly, my own sex tapes were better produced than the sex tapes these wealthy celebrities were making. But the Hogan tape redefined what a sex tape could be. It was shot on 70mm film stock with a multi-million-dollar budget, and every dollar spent ended up on the screen.  A.J. Daulerio: So I pop in the video and the first thing I see is a gorgeous helicopter shot of the Grand Canyon. The camera swoops down and reveals a nude Hulk Hogan, his penis erect, bathing underneath a waterfall.  Heather Clem (Hogan’s partner on the tape): The Hulkster’s nipples were extra long at the time we shot the sex tape, so we wanted to make sure it was really special. We didn’t want this to be some sleazy blowjob video. We wanted to really capture the eroticism and intimacy of a man in his 50s with a mondo veined-up cock and a stomach filled with tacos loving a disc jockey’s wife. There was only one place on earth where we thought it was romantic enough to shoot it: the Grand Canyon.  Leonard Maltin: It’s hard to tell if the dialog is scripted or improvised because it is so well acted. Hulk’s opening line still gives me goosebumps to this day: “This waterfall feels great on my bank-deposit-canister-sized penis. I can’t imagine anything feeling better than this. Oh wow…look over there, it’s a vagina….” Heather Clem: The basic plot is that the Hulkster is a simple man who travels the world sticking his dick into waterfalls and then realizes that there is something even more beautiful than waterfalls that he can fuck: a woman’s vagina. It’s based on Pablo Neruda’s poem The Waterfall Fucker, which actually mentions the Hulkster by name despite being written 30 years before he was even born. It’s a portrait of this poor, innocent, lonely Hulk Hogan of a man who has a gigantic boner but no idea where to put it.  A.J. Daulerio: The film that I was witnessing transcended any art I had seen up until that point in my life. Even the onion rings print. I knew I had to show it to the world. The very next day, I uploaded it to the front page of Gawker.  Brian Knobbs (Pro wrestler, Hulk’s best friend): So I fire up my Acer one morning and hop onto Gawker. The first thing I see is this beautiful banner ad for Purina Cat Chow. I mean, they’ve got a couple of Persians on there, it’s animated, playing a little midi music, excellent font choices…just gorgeous work. I don’t even have cats, but I’m thinking, “Okay, you got me, I’ll buy some of this cat chow.” Then, right underneath, I see a screen-cap of my best friend sticking his housecat-sized dick into a waterfall.  Bethany Smyth (Gawker reader): Up until the Hogan tape, most leaked celebrity sex tapes were of female celebs, so when I saw that Gawker had finally published something for the ladies, I was wet in places I didn’t even know I had. Not only is the man gorgeous, but he was clearly very full during the scene, and I love a man who chows down right before doing the nasty. Every vein in his body bulged like bratwurst beneath his skin as he slammed that waterfall. He was roaring and clapping like a drunk, mighty ape. I’d never seen anything like it.  A.J. Daulerio: Immediately, Gawker starts getting flooded with messages from people saying, “Thank you. This video saved my marriage,” or, “The Hogan sex tape reaffirmed my belief in true love.” The internet can be such a toxic, negative place that it was refreshing to be hosting something that was spreading so much joy.  Leonard Maltin: While there are only 10 seconds of actual sex on the version of the tape that Gawker posted, it contains a lifetime of erotic treasure. This isn’t a pornographic film about genitals penetrating genitals. This is a masterpiece about the quivering lips of a 50-something giant of a man porking the shit out of a waterfall and some lady. About the flabby pecs of a once-chiseled wrestler pushing up against the augmented breasts of a shock jock’s wife. About human sexuality in its purest, veiniest, most potent form. It is pure beauty.  Hulk Hogan (aka Terry Gene Bollea, pro wrestler): Imagine discovering that the most intimate, special, private, erotic, life-affirming, gooey, transcendent moment of your life was suddenly on a website called Gawker. My double-uncircumcised cock was out there for everyone to see. This was a sacred moment between two people who loved one another and radio DJs very much. I had suspicions that the encounter was being filmed because there was a crew of 60+ people surrounding us while we fucked with all sorts of cameras and stuff, but Bubba had assured me they were just filming a rare type of moss that grows near waterfalls. I was devastated. I immediately called Purina customer service and told them that Hulk Hogan would not be supporting their chow anymore.  A.J. Daulerio: At this time, the internet was still the Wild West. We assumed nothing bad could ever happen online. Our website’s motto was, “We do things, and nothing will ever happen because of them.” We had no idea of the pain to come.  Charles Harder (Lawyer for Hulk Hogan): Look, I jacked off to the Hulkster’s sex tape on Gawker just like everyone else did. But that didn’t mean I thought it was okay. The shame, embarrassment, and reputational damage that come from having your personal love life broadcast to millions—no matter how hot it is to watch—are devastating. We never wanted to argue that the Hogan tape wasn’t hot as hell. In fact, in our opening statement we told the jury they would likely be whacking off to the tape dozens of times before the trial’s end. And they did.  Hulk Hogan: Obviously I jerked off to the tape when it was up on Gawker. I mean, my cock looks like a poorly folded Chipotle burrito with all of the fixings spilling out of it in it. It’s fucking hot! When Mrs. Clem yells, “My life’s purpose is to hear our love slaps echoing through the Grand Canyon!” and I respond, “What? I can’t hear you over the waterfall!” it’s honestly the hottest thing I’ve ever seen. But I still wanted to sue the shit out of Gawker.  Elizabeth Spiers (Gawker co-founder): We created Gawker to publish daily updates on Hulk Hogan’s love life. The good, the bad, those quiet moments in between—that was our whole deal. When we started, there wasn’t really anywhere online where you could get that information besides Yahoo! News. The purity of our mission was ultimately our downfall.  Charles Harder: We wanted to go big with this and send a message to these websites that invasion of privacy is not free speech. So we asked for $900.  A.J. Daulerio: They only wanted $900 in damages, but we wanted to show them that we weren’t to be messed with. Free speech was on the line here. So we shot back and offered them $141 million instead. Charles Harder: Gawker’s lawyers weren’t the greatest negotiators. A.J. Daulerio: Honestly, I think we may have made a mistake there.  Peter Thiel (Founder, PayPal): I hated Gawker because they only ranked PayPal number 17 on their “20 Funnest Websites to Surf Online” listicle, so I threw my significant financial muscle behind the lawsuit. But apparently it wasn’t needed, because Gawker showed up to court on the very first day with an oversized check made out to Hulk Hogan for $141 million with “We are so sorry!” written in the memo. It was too easy.  Hulk Hogan: As an avid PayPal user and fan, I was thrilled when Peter called me and offered his support in our case. One minute you’re madly in love with a DJ’s wife and fucking her on muleback in the place the Hopi Tribe considers a gateway to the afterlife, the next a man whose electronic payment system you greatly respect is paying your legal bills. Life can be pretty cool sometimes.  A.J. Daulerio: We ended up paying out $141 million dollars for a post that brought in about $60 in cat chow ad money. My website was destroyed, everyone working for me lost their jobs, and I will forever be associated with the biggest blunder in the history of the internet. Sometimes people ask me if it was all worth it, and I tell them, “I got to show millions of people what true love looks like. I got to introduce millions of people to the Grand Canyon. I got to meet the founder of PayPal. I got to see the Hulkster’s absolute lunchbox of a cock. Was it worth it? Damn straight it was worth it.” I didn’t get into internet publishing to make money. I got into it for another reason, which will be my secret until the day I die.  Nancy Dubuk (Former CEO, Vice Media): Before the Gawker scandal, the internet was mostly embarrassing sex tapes that were posted without consent. People could hop online, see what their favorite celebrity’s genitals looked like, masturbate to them, and then leave an insulting comment about those genitals under the video. It was a paradise. The void left after the removal of all of those sex tapes was ultimately filled with the sadness and misery that makes up the majority of the internet today.  Deborah Archer (President, ACLU National): If posting a secretly filmed sex tape of a professional wrestler on your gossip website is no longer protected speech, then what’s next? I’m not really coming up with any examples here, but I’m sure something else will be next. The Hulk Hogan sex tape will always have a home on the front page of the ACLU’s website in defiance of this judgment, which was in complete violation of our constitutional rights and our rights as human beings to whack off to whatever the fuck we want, whenever the fuck we want, privacy be damned.  Hulk Hogan: I love my $141 million dollars. Thank you, Gawker, for violating my privacy.  Heather Clem: In the end, everyone got what they wanted. The Hulkster got $141 million dollars, Peter got to see the website he hated embarrassed, Gawker got to show everyone a magnificent sex tape and ultimately go bankrupt because of it, and I got to see the Grand Canyon. It’s nice when things work out for all involved."
Things Will Never Be The Same: The Entire Family Has Irreversibly Lost All Respect For Mom’s Intelligence After Attempting To Teach Her To Play A Relatively Simple Board Game ,N/A,https://clickhole.com/things-will-never-be-the-same-the-entire-family-has-irreversibly-lost-all-respect-for-moms-intelligence-after-attempting-to-teach-her-to-play-a-relatively-simple-board-game/,"Over the years, everyone in the family has always looked to Mom for wisdom and advice, but that will probably no longer be the case, as a troubling turn of events has left us seriously questioning her mental aptitude: The entire family has irreversibly lost all respect for Mom’s intelligence after attempting to teach her to play a relatively simple board game.  Damn. Apparently Mom is dumb as hell. Yesterday, what was meant to be a fun, low-key family game night turned into a damning indictment on Mom’s intellectual capabilities, as she struggled spectacularly to grasp the rules of a pretty simple board game called Ticket To Ride. Despite the game’s recommended age range starting at 8 years old, Mom just could not comprehend even the most basic aspects of the rules, repeatedly interrupting Dad while he read the rulebook to ask for clarification on very straightforward, self-explanatory things that even a decently trained chimpanzee could probably figure out.  While the entire premise of the game is to connect different color-coded rail routes between various cities, Mom simply could not make heads or tails of it, as she constantly derailed the gameplay to ask asinine questions like, “Wait, whose team am I on?” and “What do these cards mean?” and “Can I build any hotels?” The rest of the family, while initially amused, soon grew increasingly concerned as the woman who had guided them through life’s challenges and triumphs was now being repeatedly stymied by an activity meant for children, turning what should’ve been a 30-60 minute gaming experience into a three-hour pageant of idiocy. For every answer we gave to her shitbrained questions, she’d giddily exclaim “Oh, got it!” as if she fully understood the rules, only to moments later make yet another mistake. At one point, she even picked up one of the wooden scoring markers and rolled it like it was a die despite the game not having any dice.  It’s not like Mom’s old enough to be experiencing any age-related mental decline, so the fact that she struggled so mightily to figure out something so simple suggests that she’s apparently always been this dumb—it just took playing Ticket To Ride for us to realize it. Dear God. Guess Mom is a much different woman than we thought.  It remains to be seen how this unsettling turn of events will impact the family’s dynamics moving forward. Will everyone rally around Mom, offering unwavering support and a renewed appreciation for her other qualities? Or will this irreparable loss of respect for her intelligence cast a long shadow over the household, forever tainting our perceptions of her? Only time will tell. But let’s just say that next time any of us needs advice or homework help, we’re probably going to go to Dad."
Finally: This New Dating App Matches Men Who Recently Spent $400 On Red Hot Chili Peppers Tickets With Women Who Are In The Process Of Freezing Their Eggs,N/A,https://clickhole.com/finally-this-new-dating-app-matches-men-who-recently-spent-400-on-red-hot-chili-peppers-tickets-with-women-who-are-in-the-process-of-freezing-their-eggs/,"If you’re a straight man or woman who’s been feeling like you’re never going to meet “The One,” it’s time to breathe a sigh of relief, because a new online dating platform has got you covered: This new dating app matches men who recently spent $400 on Red Hot Chili Peppers tickets with women who are in the process of freezing their eggs! Finally! Say goodbye to single life! Listen up, men who recently spent half their paycheck on tickets to see a rock band that peaked in popularity 20 years ago and women who’ve lost the hope that they’ll meet someone while they’re still fertile, because this new dating service is seriously going to improve your love life. Named “CantStop” as a reference to both the Red Hot Chili Peppers song and the fact that women on the app “can’t stop” dating now if they ever expect to start a family, the app uses a precise algorithm that takes into account factors such as your favorite RHCP song if you’re a guy, and how many thousands of dollars you’ve already sunk into the egg freezing process if you’re a girl. It’s guaranteed to kick off a lifelong partnership between two people in their early 30’s, both of whom figure they won’t have kids for another 15 to 20 years, but for completely different reasons! It’s seriously like these two groups of people were made for each other! The men just want to talk about the fascinating story behind the RCHP logo, and the women are at a point where they’re fine with listening to that all dinner long because it at least means they have dinner plans!  To join, men need to upload a photo of their most recent RHCP ticket—but if the ticket got soaked in Bud Light and is now illegible, don’t panic, because the app’s creators confirm that a photo of yourself wearing the multiple shirts and bandanas you bought at the show will do. For the women, no proof that you’ve frozen your eggs is necessary, as it’s all but guaranteed that no woman would join the app if she weren’t completely out of other options. The app then will ask each user to fill out a questionnaire so that it’s able to most effectively pair users based on compatibility. This will include questions for men like, “John Frusciante: awesome guitarist or awesomest guitarist?” and questions for women like, “Will you be able to look past the fact that your partner is going to put on ‘Dani California’ during sex as long as he responds to your texts in a timely fashion?”  So romantic! Don’t waste your time waiting for love to fall into your lap. If you’re a man who’s go-to fun fact is that some of Flea’s spit fell on you while you were in the pit, or if you’re a 31-year-old woman who has come to terms with the fact you won’t be conceiving naturally, then pull out your phone and download this app today!"
Leveling With Us: The American Dental Association Has Confirmed That The Benefits Of Brushing Your Teeth At The Office Don’t Outweigh The Social Repercussions,N/A,https://clickhole.com/leveling-with-us-the-american-dental-association-has-confirmed-that-the-benefits-of-brushing-your-teeth-at-the-office-dont-outweigh-the-social-repercussions/,"It’s a rare thing to see an organization acknowledge findings at odds with their own agenda, but a leading group of dentists just gave us a refreshingly frank perspective on the pros and cons of enthusiastic oral hygiene: The American Dental Association has confirmed that the benefits of brushing your teeth at the office don’t outweigh the social repercussions. Hey, we appreciate them being upfront about it! After a comprehensive meta-analysis of research on the subject, the American Dental Association put out a statement today explaining that while brushing your teeth at the office confers substantial advantages to the health of the teeth and gums, the stigma of being your office’s resident “toothbrush freak” is nevertheless severe enough to make such behavior a net negative on overall wellbeing. The statement unflinchingly lays out how coworkers will whisper behind your back about the spent tubes of Crest Complete Whitening Plus Scope slowly piling up in your cubicle’s waste bin, with office friendships deteriorating under the strain of people fearing that you might bust out the toothbrush at any moment and flick minty spittle all over them if they linger too long in your presence. While ducking out of meetings for a quick post-lunch brush does help reduce plaque buildup and prevent cavities, the ADA contends, the ensuing reputational damage would make even the brightest smile a deeply pyrrhic victory. “As dentists, we’re always trying to get people to brush their teeth more often, so when we tell you that doing it at work just isn’t worth it, you should understand that it will irreversibly torpedo your professional relationships in a way even we can’t justify,” said ADA president George Shepley, adding that brushing at work “just isn’t a thing that sane people do” and that “if your breath smells bad, you should just chew some gum like a normal person.” “We’ll be straight with you, there’s really just no good way to do it. At your desk is awkward because where are you gonna spit, right? You might think the bathroom would be okay, but you putting stuff in your mouth while a coworker sprays feces five feet away is some sicko shit you’d never live down. Kitchen’s right out too, because no one wants to see you hocking frothy blue-white loogies in the sink while they’re trying to eat a sandwich. We wish we had better news, we really do. But we don’t, and it’s not worth brushing that coffee taste out of your mouth if it’s gonna earn you an office-wide reputation as one of the weird coworkers.” That’s an admirable level of candor for an organization that has every reason to want you to brush your teeth. A lesser dental advocacy group might have been willing to overlook cultural norms in their single-minded pursuit of a cavity-free society, but the ADA has the wisdom to know that the office favorite with a good reputation and some gunk in their teeth is better off than the office pariah with a glistening grin and no friends to show it. The telltale white splotches of errant toothpaste spit on one’s shirt might as well be a big scarlet F for FREAK OF THE TOOTHBRUSHING VARIETY, so kudos to the ADA for coming clean with Americans that dental hygiene has to occasionally take a back seat to not behaving like a deranged little weirdo!"
Representation Matters: CBS Is Letting An Extremely Depressed Teenager Host ‘The Price Is Right’,N/A,https://clickhole.com/representation-matters-cbs-is-letting-an-extremely-depressed-teenager-host-the-price-is-right/,"Society still has a long way to go towards destigmatizing mental illness, but one TV network is making a huge stride in the right direction by putting a spotlight on the issue and reminding viewers that nobody is alone in their battles: CBS is letting an extremely depressed teenager host The Price Is Right. Awesome! What a huge win for inclusivity.  In an effort to highlight the internal struggles that millions of Americans deal with on a daily basis, Price Is Right star Drew Carey will be stepping aside from his duties for the next month to allow Caleb Moskal, a clinically depressed 15-year-old, to host the iconic gameshow. For the first time in the show’s history, fans will be shown an authentic portrayal of a major depressive disorder, as Caleb battles despair, feelings of worthlessness, and spontaneous crying spells while interacting with contestants and announcing exciting prizes such as new cars, juicers, and trips to Aruba. It’s still unclear exactly how this will play out on air, but a commercial preview of Caleb’s hosting stint shows him lying on the studio floor with headphones in and a hoodie over his head, while contestants lead the gameplay on their own, occasionally tapping the gloomy teen on the shoulder to ask for clarification on the rules, to which Caleb only responds with a long sigh or a cry of “Leave me the fuck alone!” “The Price Is Right has long showcased fabulous prizes and getaways during the Showcase Showdown, but for the next month, we’re going to be showcasing something much more important: teenage mental illness,” said CBS in a press release. “From its inception, The Price Is Right has been synonymous with joy, excitement, and boundless energy, but now viewers can experience truly debilitating sadness through our non-functional depressive teenage host, who, in addition to soliciting guesses for the prices of dining room sets and catamarans, will also be showing viewers the everyday realities of his mental illness, whether that involves taking SSRIs, muttering about hating life, or yelling at his mom for trying to make him eat. By featuring Caleb curled up in the fetal position and sobbing underneath The Big Wheel, we’re showing America that mental illness isn’t a ‘problem,’ but rather a normal part of the human experience.” Amazing! This is such a beautiful gesture by The Price Is Right. Hopefully Caleb’s mental health improves, but either way, it’s encouraging to see mental health concerns represented like this on a nationally syndicated TV show. Kudos to you, CBS!"
"Congratulations, Jessica! ClickHole Is Proud To Announce That Our Inaugural Emerging Voices Grant Has Been Awarded To Jessica Chastain",N/A,https://clickhole.com/congratulations-jessica-clickhole-is-proud-to-announce-that-our-inaugural-emerging-voices-grant-has-been-awarded-to-jessica-chastain/,"Since announcing ClickHole’s inaugural Emerging Voices Program last fall, a program made possible by the generous support of our sponsors Little Debbie and J.Crew, we’ve been incredibly grateful for the excitement generated by our followers and the digital media community.

Thanks again to Little Debbie and J.Crew for their commitment to supporting emerging digital writers. Now let’s all give a warm ClickHole welcome to Jessica Chastain!"
Don’t Try To Tell Us It Isn’t Rigged: Ann Romney Just Won Mitt Romney’s First Annual Fuck-A-Fan Contest,N/A,https://clickhole.com/dont-try-to-tell-us-it-isnt-rigged-ann-romney-just-won-mitt-romneys-first-annual-fuck-a-fan-contest/,"We don’t want to sound like we’re being sore losers here, but the outcome of a supposedly legitimate giveaway has made it impossible for us to believe there was ever a level playing field to begin with: Ann Romney just won Mitt Romney’s first annual fuck-a-fan contest. Oh sure, the guy’s wife just happened to win by coincidence. Sure! The first-ever Meet Mitt’s Meat Annual Fan Fuck Extravaganza came to a frankly bullshit conclusion this morning, with an announcement on Romney’s official senate.gov webpage saying, “We’ve drawn our winner for my inaugural fuck-a-fan contest, and the lucky member of Romney Nation to get dicked down by my 10 Mormon inches is…the light of my life and mother of my five wonderful boys, Mrs. Ann Romney! Honey, our lovemaking has always been a sacred expression of intimacy and trust, but this time, Ol’ Mitt’s gonna truly FUCK ya. I’m talking about a fuck that breaks the bed frame, a fuck so hard our maid will be scrubbing squirt off of the gosh-darn ceiling. I’m deeply grateful to my millions of fans and constituents who threw their hats into the ring to get piped by yours truly, but there can only be one winner, so ditch those culottes, darlin’, because sweet Papa Mitt’s coming to pump those holes full of Romney sauce!” Honestly, we’re beyond disappointed by this. Romney’s been plugging this goddamn contest on social media for months now, and after repeatedly insisting that everyone who entered had an equal chance to throat Utah’s tallest freestanding tube steak, he just goes and gives it to his wife. We can’t really fault Ann here because who wouldn’t want to tear off that guy’s temple garments like he’s some kind of horse-cocked Christmas present, but the thing is, she already does! She presumably gets to huff the musky tang of his fuck sweat on the regular! She knows all about what it’s like to make Mitt Romney whisper “Golly!” as he eases himself in; to feel the rhythm of his frantic heartbeat pulsing through the base of his shaft, fuzzy chest heaving as he gulps for air like a fish on land; to hear him giggle uncontrollably when his eyes finally roll into the back of his head and two tablespoons of liquid Mitt erupt out of him with the force of a pressure washer. This contest should have let someone else experience the joy of Romney’s libidinal gifts, but nope! All along, it was just a fraudulent bait-and-switch. Spare us the “Better luck next time” crap—if it’s not an apology or Mitt squealing above us in ecstasy, we don’t want to hear it! Listen, truth be told, we realize that us getting to fuck Mitt Romney was always a statistical long shot. Dude is one of the most lusted-after conservative lawmakers of the past century, so we knew the math wasn’t in our favor. But what this contest really promised wasn’t the sex itself: it was the fantasy that a homely nobody like us could ever bang a caked up Utah senator like him. Simply knowing that a real fan somewhere out there had gotten to live the dream and do some steamy Pierre Delecto roleplay would have felt like a victory for everyone who’s desperately yearned for Romney’s piston hips to put them in a wheelchair, because even if it wasn’t us that won, we could tell ourselves it might have been. But Ann Romney winning totally shatters that illusion, and now we’re left with nothing but the difficult-to-orgasm-to reality that Mitt’s immaculate dick game was never within our reach. Well, it looks like Mitt Romney managed to fuck us in the one way we didn’t want. Here’s hoping he cleans up his act for next year’s contest and fucks a fan who was selected through an actual legitimate process!"
World’s Dumbest Man: The Guy Behind You At The Baseball Game Genuinely Believes The Jumbotron CGI Baseball Is Under Hat #3,N/A,https://clickhole.com/worlds-dumbest-man-the-guy-behind-you-at-the-baseball-game-genuinely-believes-the-jumbotron-cgi-baseball-is-under-hat-3/,"If you’re ever feeling bad about yourself, it might help to remind yourself that you’re a much more impressive individual than a lot of people out there. Case in point: The guy behind you at the baseball game genuinely believes the jumbotron CGI baseball is under hat #3. Jesus Christ, is he really that goddamn stupid? The ball’s OBVIOUSLY under hat #2—even the kids in the crowd are getting it right. The kind of dumb you have to be to stand out in a Citi Field crowd of Mets fans is almost too sad to fathom, but here it is, in the flesh, a man sitting right behind you, braying, “Tree!!! Hat numba tree!!!” over and over like a cross-eyed fucking donkey. Naturally, as the biggest imbecile on Earth, he’s also the loudest, most confident person in the stadium, shouting “It went under hat numba tree!!! I saw it!!!” at a deafening volume as if trying to wow the entire seating section by brilliantly solving the animated hat-shuffling game, despite the fact that he’s very obviously wrong. Literally anyone with a pulse can tell it’s under hat #2, you squid-brained fuck!  What’s especially sad here is that his 9-year-old son is with him, and even his kid calling hat #2 like everyone else. In a few moments, when the actual correct answer is revealed, this poor kid’s about to see his own dad get exposed as King Of The Dipshits in front of thousands of people. That’s a kind of trauma that will stay with him for years to come.  Sheesh. It’s honestly depressing that people like this are allowed to breed.  While you can’t help but feel bad for his kid, it’ll admittedly be very satisfying to see this idiot’s heart sink once he realizes he picked the wrong hat. Watching a jackass fail so spectacularly at a type of game that literal chimpanzees dominate in science labs every day will undoubtedly be more entertaining than anything that happens on the field. God, what a moron!"
"Oh My Fucking God, Seriously? The Mellow Chittering Of The Sparrows And The Sun’s Soft Sheen Upon The Reeds Have Inspired This Loser To Sit Down And Write A Poem",N/A,https://clickhole.com/oh-my-fucking-god-seriously-the-mellow-chittering-of-the-sparrows-and-the-suns-soft-sheen-upon-the-reeds-have-inspired-this-loser-to-sit-down-and-write-a-poem/,"Get ready to get pissed, because one dumbass dork sitting by a babbling brook seems to think that the endless bounty of Mother Nature is something he needs to depict in verse: The mellow chittering of the sparrows and the sun’s soft sheen upon the reeds have inspired this loser to sit down and write a poem. Get a fucking life, man! Robert Lincoln of Stafford, Virginia is seemingly vying to break the world record for lameness right now, as he’s spending his lunch break sitting by a local creek bed with his notebook, jotting down evocative descriptions of the jabbering squirrels that dart from tree to tree and the steadfast shushing of the water, gentle as a mother as she soothes her restless babe. Robert could easily have avoided this whole dumb production if he’d just stayed home and played with his phone, but instead he’s jotting down inane bullshit while he listens to the songbirds sing in the same ancient language our foremothers knew, a sound that was a balm to their ears as they did the daily washing that became ever more difficult as the years cramped their hands and dimmed their eyesight. When a heron showed up down in the reeds, Robert even got really close to it so he could observe how it moved with the deliberateness of a soldier at the moment of attack, yet also gave off an abiding sense of peace as the sun caught its resplendent white feathers—marking all these observations down in pen to…what…read to somebody later? Whatever floats your boat, Robert. Fuckin’ dork. After half an hour, Robert had already come up with several idiotic rhyming couplets about the slow fading of the sun’s light and the clean evening breeze that seemed to foreshadow the sweet dawn of the following day. It’s crazy to think that he voluntarily spent an afternoon composing this garbage just to express the profound connection he experiences when he immerses himself in the beauty and violence of the natural world, but he straight up did. Maybe he has mental problems or something! Whatever’s wrong with him, all we can say is that we certainly won’t be reading his stupid poem when it’s finished. Fat chance, Robert!"
The Truth Is Out There: The FBI Has Determined This Crop Circle In Idaho Was Not Created By Extraterrestrial Life But Just The Cast Of ‘Severance’,N/A,https://clickhole.com/the-truth-is-out-there-the-fbi-has-determined-this-crop-circle-in-idaho-was-not-created-by-extraterrestrial-life-but-just-the-cast-of-severance/,"It makes perfect sense that a farmer would think they’d stumbled upon proof of alien life after waking up to see that their fields had been turned into crop circles. Fortunately for one man in Idaho, the FBI has determined that the crop circles found on his property last week were not in fact created by extraterrestrial life, but just the cast of Severance. What a relief it must be to know that your crops weren’t destroyed by aliens, but instead just the cast of Apple+’s hit TV show having some fun! As soon as 55-year-old Idaho farmer Rich Tyman discovered that his crops had been flattened in an eerie, circular pattern, he immediately alerted the authorities, fearing that his property had been visited by sinister beings from another planet. After conducting a thorough survey of the property and finding both a Lumon Industries key card and a finger trap in the dirt, the FBI reached a different conclusion: the circles were most likely the work of Severance stars Adam Scott, Britt Lower, Zach Cherry, and John Turturro. In their search, the FBI also discovered wheel markings in the crops that appeared to be from some sort of office utility cart, suggesting that the rest of the cast must have worked in tandem with Tramell Tillman to flatten the crops with the character Milchik’s cart from the show. This theory is supported by the large number of crushed deviled eggs found in the fields—not to mention the fact that Rich reported waking in the night to hear the hum of music that could only be described as “defiant jazz.” Wow. Seems like we know who did it, then! The FBI has issued the following statement to the agriculture sector: “Farmers—if you find that crop circles have been made on your property please check for the following items before jumping to the conclusion that you’ve been targeted by aliens: Lumon-branded coffee mugs, a mask of Kier Eagan, waffles, or a strange-looking old computer. The appearance of any of these items means that your crops were likely destroyed by the cast of Severance blowing off some steam while taking a break from shooting. This appears to be a bonding activity for the cast, as it seems likely that mowing down corn stalks under the cover of the night is what has given the show such a dynamic ensemble energy.” Good to know! This is definitely something to be aware of if you have crops! While the destroyed crops will result in a substantial net loss for Rich that may affect whether or not he’s able to keep his house, fortunately, the cast left behind a coupon code that will give him three free months of Apple+. What a bummer it is that Rich didn’t go outside while the cast was still on his property, as perhaps a handshake would’ve been available upon request!"
"Parenting Win: When This Teen Was Bullied In The Locker Room For Being Uncircumcised, His Dad Came In And Explained To The Entire School How Much Easier Being Uncut Makes It To Jerk Off",N/A,https://clickhole.com/parenting-win-when-this-teen-was-bullied-in-the-locker-room-for-being-uncircumcised-his-dad-came-in-and-explained-to-the-entire-school-how-much-easier-being-uncut-makes-it-to-jerk-off/,"It may not even be summer yet, but we’re pretty sure we’ve already got our vote for Father of the Year locked in after hearing about this: When this teen was being bullied in the locker room for being uncircumcised, his dad came in and explained to the entire school how much easier being uncut makes it to jerk off.  Amazing!  Ever since 14-year-old Michael Rory’s classmates noticed that he was uncircumcised in the shower after swimming one day, his life at school has been hell. With his classmates relentlessly mocking him with cruel nicknames such as “alien dick” and “the Human Shar Pei,” Michael finally had enough and approached his dad, Ted, and asked if he could get circumcised. But Ted had another idea: After making a call to the principal of the school, Ted showed up ready to defend his son from his bullies in front of the entire grade in the gymnasium by describing how the foreskin helps keep the glans moist and acts almost as a natural pocket pussy while jerking off, making it much easier for his son to masturbate.  Using a PowerPoint presentation, a homemade video, and various props, Ted absolutely killed it as a dad for a full 30 minutes, explaining, “Having a foreskin means your hand never needs to directly touch the head of your dick when you jack off,” while inspiring music played from the gym’s PA system. “When my uncircumcised son jerks off, he can squeeze as hard as he wants to because his foreskin provides a protective layer of cushioning and lubrication that allows for more direct pressure without chafing. The soft skin dangling from the end of an uncut penis provides a unique sensation that can’t be replicated when you’re circumcised.” “Not to mention the fact that uncircumcised cocks are more sensitive than cut ones,” he continued, gesturing to a photo-filled PowerPoint slide detailing the erogenous hot-spots of the human penis and the diminished orgasmic intensity one experiences with an unsheathed meatus. “That means my son, Michael, can cum faster than his circumcised peers and without the need of expensive lubricants and toys. It’s basically like having a built-in vagina on the end of his dick at all times that he can fuck at will. In comparison, jerking off when you have a cut dick is like fucking a bowl of hot, dry sand. While the uncut guys are still in their bedroom trying to figure out how to nut in frustration, my kid is already outside skateboarding with his balls drained.” Wow! This, folks, is how parenting is done.  If only all dads were this loving and supportive. There’s no way bullies will mess with Michael now after his dad’s incredible presentation. He’ll be able to walk tall and proud down the halls knowing that his uncircumcised cock affords him a superior masturbatory experience. Turns out having an “alien dick” is actually pretty cool after all! "
You’re Coming Off Like Losers: This Vegan Snack Brand’s Packaging Keeps Emphasizing How ‘Obsessed’ They Are With Finding The Healthiest Ingredients,N/A,https://clickhole.com/youre-coming-off-like-losers-this-vegan-snack-brands-packaging-keeps-emphasizing-how-obsessed-they-are-finding-the-healthiest-ingredients/,"Nobody likes a fucking nerd, but it seems like one health food company didn’t get that memo, because their messaging about the food they put out is making them seem like the absolute dorks of the century: This vegan snack brand’s packaging keeps emphasizing how “obsessed” they are with finding the healthiest ingredients. Jesus, guys, you sound so lame! The people at Kind Acres snack foods must have basically zero self-awareness, as they decided to use their products’ packaging to volunteer the information that they devote “every waking hour to sourcing the purest sweeteners on Earth and obsessing over the quality of [their] grains,” making it seem as if they have zero hobbies or social life and genuinely believe that being single-mindedly fixated on amaranth and fuckin’ teff is something to brag about. Ignoring the fact that literally no consumer in history has ever gone to the grocery store looking for a brand weirdly preoccupied with millet lineage, Kind Acres apparently thinks that people want to buy vegan snacks made by a band of Rain Man-tier neurotics who “eat, sleep, and breathe organic ingredients,” because they even included a photo of their team members grinning like a bunch of idiots next to an array of bins full of raw quinoa and millet. Inspecting millet is just about the least cool thing a person could possibly do, but these dweebs are literally broadcasting themselves not only doing it, but acting like everyone will be wowed by the sight of them posing with bulk ancient grains. Do you not see how you’re coming off here, Kind Acres? Definitely not as cool as you think! According to the Kind Acres packaging, their food scientists have dedicated their “hearts and souls” to finding the best ingredients to include in Kind Acres snacks, and have “crossed and re-crossed the globe” in search of the finest sea salt, cleanest oils, and healthiest nuts to add to their products. But frankly, this just makes us want to steer really fucking clear of these nerds and buy some less embarrassing snacks like Cheetos or Ritz Bits instead. Get a grip, Kind Acres!  "
Brava: This Woman At A Party Is Doing An Incredibly Convincing Job Making It Seem Like She’s Going To Start Watching ‘Abbott Elementary’,N/A,https://clickhole.com/brava-this-woman-at-a-party-is-doing-an-incredibly-convincing-job-making-it-seem-like-shes-going-to-start-watching-abbott-elementary/,"Any fine performance deserves a round of applause, and the show currently being put on by this 29-year-old partygoer is certainly worth a standing ovation: This woman at a housewarming party is doing an incredibly convincing job making it seem like she’s going to start watching Abbott Elementary. Brava, lady! Brava! While it would be the genuine truth for Ellie Paskitze of Brooklyn, NY to say that she’s flat out never going to watch Abbott Elementary, it would come off as bizarrely rude to admit such a thing to ardent fans of the show—which is why Ellie has been giving the performance of a lifetime for the past ten minutes as she successfully convinces everyone around her that she will indeed “check it out as soon as possible.” After hearing an impassioned speech from her college friend about how Abbott Elementary is “literally amazing,” the masterful actress asked, “Where can I watch that?” knowing full well it doesn’t matter where she can watch it, because she’s never, ever going to do that. And upon learning where she can stream the show, Ellie continued to develop her character of “Woman Who Will Most Certainly Be Watching Abbott Elementary” as she added, “Oh, Hulu, nice, I have that, yeah.” Aha! See, Ellie doesn’t really have Hulu, yet these people all think she does! Well done, Ellie! Well done! But the true climax of Ellie’s performance was still to come! After her friends continued on to explain that the show is “about a Philadelphia public school,” and “really realistic about education and schooling stuff,” Ellie delivered a line so believably that it’s shocking she hasn’t yet won an Oscar: “Oh yeah, my good friend’s a teacher in Philly, so it’ll definitely hit close to home.” They’re eating out of the palm of your hand, Ellie! “Close to home?” Ellie hasn’t spoken to that friend in years! That friend might not even be a teacher anymore for all she knows! All the more impressive is how Ellie has remained steadfast in her performance despite the numerous challenges thrown her way. Even though she excused herself to get another drink, thus shifting out of character and re-inhabiting the mindset a woman who has zero interest in Abbott Elementary, when she returned, not only was the group still talking Abbott, but two new people had joined, both of whom were Abbott stans! Fortunately, Ellie’s acting abilities stood the test, because before the new conversationalists could even tell her about how the show is a “regular sitcom but funny,” she seamlessly slipped back into character to say that while she hadn’t watched it yet, she had plans to queue it up the second she got home from the party. Yes, Ellie! They believe every word you say! One might even text you tomorrow to hear how you liked it! Simply fantastic. If you’re at this party right now, grab some popcorn and enjoy the rest of Ellie’s performance, because acting this good should be celebrated."
Never Meet Your Heroes: Tim Burton Just Got Flipped Off By A Skeleton He Had Asked For An Autograph,N/A,https://clickhole.com/never-meet-your-heroes-tim-burton-just-got-flipped-off-by-a-skeleton-he-had-asked-for-an-autograph/,"It’s easy to put your idols on a pedestal when you only ever see them from afar, but a celebrated filmmaker is learning the hard way that they won’t always live up to your expectations in person: Tim Burton just got flipped off by a skeleton he had asked for an autograph. Oof, that’s gotta sting—Tim Burton has always adored the macabre! Poor Tim Burton probably thought it was his lucky day when he happened upon a West Hollywood cafe where a skeleton was seated outside nursing a caramel macchiato. Spooky shit like bats and ghosts have long been a major source of inspiration for Burton, and here was the chance to meet an honest-to-God skeleton, easily the most iconic ghoul in the game. He checked his breath and fished out the little wallet photo of a skeleton he always keeps on him for good luck, and it was honestly very endearing to see the award-winning director beaming like a giddy schoolboy while he walked up to fulfill his life’s dream. But sadly, his earnest excitement soon gave way to heartbroken shame, because upon introducing himself and asking if the skeleton would give him an autograph, the skeleton thrust out a bony middle finger and told Tim Burton to take a fucking hike. The tears welling up in his eyes make it painfully clear that Burton never thought meeting his hero would go down like this. He nervously tried to smooth things over by mentioning that he had created Jack Skellington from The Nightmare Before Christmas as a tribute to the legendary spookiness of human bones, adding that the skeleton had been a guiding light to him ever since his childhood days shooting stop motion shorts in his backyard, but this heartfelt outpouring of admiration only caused the skeleton to sigh in exasperation and snarl, “I literally could not give less of a shit. Just let me enjoy my coffee, asshole.” Burton turned beet red as he noticed the other patrons looking over at his humiliation, his words falling to a quavering whisper as the skeleton impatiently drummed his fingers against the table, but he managed to choke out an apologetic explanation that he had only wanted to thank the skeleton for inspiring him to make Corpse Bride and didn’t mean any harm. Alas, the enraged skeleton shouted that his coffee had now gone completely cold while Burton stood there “blubbering like a dumbfuck,” before snatching up a handful of sweetener packets, flinging them at Burton’s face with a vicious “Here’s your fuckin’ autograph, you clown,” and storming off back to the graveyard while giving him a final one-finger salute. Just brutal. Somebody needs to get Danny Elfman or whoever to make sure this guy’s okay! In fairness to the skeleton, we can understand how exasperating it must be to constantly be recognized in public for your millennia symbolizing life’s inevitable progression to death, and while Burton couldn’t have known this, the skeleton had just five minutes earlier had to deal with some shitty teens crassly asking if they could use the skeleton’s femurs to play his ribcage like a marimba. That’s a lot to put up with when you’re just trying to pour coffee down your totally fleshless throat and onto the ground beneath you, but still, that doesn’t make it right to flip off a well-meaning fan so hard he crumples up his special photo of you and runs off down the sidewalk crying. Damn, no horror buff ever wants to catch the bird from the human bones they’ve idolized since childhood. Here’s hoping Tim Burton can meet some sort of friendly mummy or reanimated dog ASAP and restore his faith in the morbid spirits he loves so well!"
What Does This Mean For Soda? The CEO Of Coca-Cola Just Announced That He Doesn’t Give A Fuck Anymore,N/A,https://clickhole.com/what-does-this-mean-for-soda-the-ceo-of-coca-cola-just-announced-that-he-doesnt-give-a-fuck-anymore/,"Soda fans are bracing for an uncertain future, because an industry titan has sent shockwaves rippling through the wider world of soft drinks with an inscrutable yet portentous proclamation: The CEO of Coca-Cola just announced that he doesn’t give a fuck anymore. Should we be stockpiling soda now before the effects of this start reaching the shelves? Chairman and CEO of The Coca-Cola Company James Quincey turned the beverage market on its head this morning when he released an official statement saying, “Just letting people know that I truly do not give a single fuck anymore. As of today I’m completely done stressing about meaningless bullshit and the approval of dumb motherfuckers I don’t even like. Life’s gonna be on my terms now, and if anybody doesn’t like that, they can die choking on my ass.” Investors and consumers alike were alarmed to learn just how over it the soda executive has become, with fears that this new no-fucks-given attitude could disrupt operations and compromise the quality of the world’s most popular soft drink, not to mention subsidiary brands like Fanta and Dr. Pepper. Coca-Cola’s competitors seem to smell blood in the water too, with PepsiCo CEO Ramon Laguarta quickly staking out his own lane amid the fallout with a response stating that he personally still gives tons of fucks about soda and is in it to win it 100 percent. While this kind of sharp pivot is certainly jarring, Quincey’s who-gives-a-shit outlook may not necessarily be a bad thing for soda. Sure, it won’t be good if Coca-Cola starts phoning it in on things like long-lasting fizziness and keeping stray metal shards out of their soda bottles, but it’s just as possible that a CEO beholden to no one could bring about the introduction of wildly creative new flavors like Coca-Cola Saffron or Spicy Coke or even some kind of Coca-Cola wine. Hell, there’s a decent chance we might actually see straight-up cocaine make its long-awaited return to the Coke formula if Quincey takes not giving a fuck to its most daring extremes. It all comes down to whether the fucks he used to give were the guardrails keeping soda consistently delicious or the shackles holding soda back from its true potential, and that’s something only time will tell. For better or worse, soda is about to change. “Soda has always oscillated between periods of stability and periods of great upheaval, and though a Coca-Cola CEO saying he’s fresh out of fucks to give certainly suggests an inflection point is upon us, it’s worth remembering that soda has generally become tastier and more thirst-quenching over the last century despite countless temporary setbacks,” said soda historian Dr. Kenneth Wheelwright of Cornell University, urging soda fans considering drastic, irreversible actions to adopt a wait-and-see approach instead. “Think back to New Coke, or the NYC soda ban, or WWII-era sugar rationing—these things were all seen as existential crises for soda at the time, yet soda endured. Maybe Coke drops out of the big leagues to become a niche offering like Moxie, or lemon-lime sodas succeed colas as the dominant soda of the age. But soda will still exist in some way, even if it’s no longer the soda you once knew.” Wow, Coca-Cola’s CEO has really shaken things up by not giving a fuck anymore. Perhaps all we can do is embrace the fact that we live in a time of change, and not take anything for granted about the sodas we drink in the meantime!"
A Peek Behind The Veil: McDonald’s Is Adding A Third Drive-Thru Window That Looks Into Grimace’s Bedroom So Customers Can Admire His Surprisingly Humble Lifestyle While Slowly Driving Past,N/A,https://clickhole.com/a-peek-behind-the-veil-mcdonalds-is-adding-a-third-drive-thru-window-that-looks-into-grimaces-bedroom-so-customers-can-admire-his-surprisingly-humble-lifestyle-while-slowly-driving/,"Fast food consumers are well acquainted with McDonald’s two drive-thru windows for exchanging payment and receiving food, but the next time they slowly accelerate away after getting their McDouble and nuggets, a newly installed third window will treat them to a brief yet revealing glance at Grimace’s remarkably modest day-to-day existence. The spartan furnishings of the purple monster’s bedroom will no doubt astonish customers who expected French fry-themed chandeliers and fountains with Greek goddesses pouring endless milkshakes from urns, but the serene calm on Grimace’s face as he contents himself tending to a single potted ficus will quickly turn that surprise into a deep and abiding appreciation of his boundless humility. Grimace’s bedroom is a far cry from the marble floors and Central Park views of Ronald McDonald’s ostentatious Manhattan penthouse, or the heart-shaped jacuzzis and mirrored ceilings of the Hamburglar’s Hollywood Hills pleasure palace, but it’s certainly not run-down by any stretch of the imagination either. Grimace keeps his space clean and well-maintained, and drive-thru customers can frequently expect to see him spreading up his twin mattress with fresh linens or performing some light carpentry to fix a stubborn drawer on his unfinished pine dresser. Grimace’s abode is so plain and unassuming that even the briefest glance through the new drive-thru window will be enough time to catalog its contents in full, though it still has an undeniably cozy charm thanks to two tastefully displayed pieces of hanging wall art—an understated watercolor of a Big Mac Combo Meal with medium fries and Coca Cola, and a framed photograph of his legal guardian, Ronald McDonald. You’d never guess that this simple bedroom belongs to the mascot of a multi-billion dollar company, but Grimace knows how to defy expectations. “Grimace’s down-to-earth temperament and lack of pretension are a constant inspiration to all McDonald’s employees, and we’ve decided to give our customers a chance to see his quiet grace for themselves,” said McDonald’s President and CEO Chris Kempczinski, adding that while Grimace will often be present in the room, he may occasionally have to pop out to rake leaves for an elderly neighbor or return a library book. “The next time you slowly drive away with your takeout order, we hope our new drive-thru window will remind you that true wealth is determined not by the lavishness of one’s bedroom, but by the fullness of one’s soul.” Wow, it’s so cool to get a look behind the scenes like this. Kudos to McDonald’s for letting us join in on admiring Grimace’s humble yet dignified way of life!"
Incredibly Prescient And Eerie: This Farm Has Pretty Much All Of The Same Animals From George Orwell’s ‘Animal Farm’,N/A,https://clickhole.com/incredibly-prescient-and-eerie-this-farm-has-pretty-much-all-of-the-same-animals-from-george-orwells-animal-farm/,"George Orwell is rightfully considered one of the most prescient voices in literature, and this only proves just how chillingly accurate his vision really was: This farm has pretty much all of the same animals from Animal Farm. Okay, did Orwell have a time machine? Because there’s literally no other explanation for how spot-on Animal Farm was. We have chills right now. Pigs, horses, donkeys, goats, cows, sheep, humans. Name basically any animal from Orwell’s allegorical novella, and this farm in Hartford City, Indiana has it—almost as if the author based his satirical fable on this specific farm! Even though this farmer doesn’t keep a raven or any geese like there are in Animal Farm, it’s giving us goosebumps to see just how close this place is to being a perfect reflection of George Orwell’s fable.  But it gets even eerier, because the book’s descriptions of each animal character map on to this farm’s inhabitants uncannily well. For example: Orwell describes his book’s pigs as “fat” and “large.” Lo and behold, the pigs on this farm are fat and large too. Boxer, Orwell’s “strong” horse character? Pretty much a mirror image of this farm’s horse, which definitely looks strong. As for Orwell’s farmer? A “heavy drinker.” This farmer? A severe alcoholic beyond all doubt. So many details in this book parallel the reality of life on this farm. We’d be impressed if it wasn’t so darn spooky! How on earth did Orwell know all this back in 1945?! His literary foresight is truly unmatched. Few authors can claim to be as visionary as George Orwell, and the animals on this farm are living proof. Somehow, some way, 80 years ago, Orwell knew exactly where the future of farms was headed. Incredible!"
Say It Ain’t So! Timothée Chalamet Just Got Drafted To Fight In Vietnam,N/A,https://clickhole.com/say-it-aint-so-timothee-chalamet-just-got-drafted-to-fight-in-vietnam/,"We’re feeling so blue today we hardly know what to do with ourselves, because one of Hollywood’s brightest rising stars has caught a one-way ticket straight to the shit: Timothée Chalamet just got drafted to fight in Vietnam. Best of luck over there, pal. We’re pullin’ for ya! Timothée Chalamet’s standout performances in Call Me By Your Name and Bones And All made it seem like he was headed to the top, but thanks to an unfortunate draw at today’s draft lottery, it looks like he’s headed overseas to join the U.S. military in its ongoing war against North Vietnam instead. Once he ships out for boot camp, he’ll trade his call sheets for an M16 and spend several brutal weeks learning how to shoot, dig trenches, and drive his bayonet deep into another man’s belly. You can bet his drill instructors will go extra hard on the pretty boy who carried Dune to the top of the box office, but those grueling five-mile runs and crawls under barbed wire will probably feel like a cakewalk once he gets choppered deep into the jungles of Quảng Trị province and finds himself square in the path of an NVA battalion. It’s hard to imagine a worse place for Timothée Chalamet than the frontlines of the Vietnam War. His hunky looks might have made us swoon in his shirtless Instagram selfies, but it will make him easy pickings for Viet Cong snipers taking potshots at lightly armored infantry targets. His remarkable acting skills are also now much less likely to dazzle and delight than they are to set off landmines or impale his foot on a shit-smeared punji stick camouflaged beneath the jungle’s dense undergrowth, not to mention the various tripwires just waiting to send a spiked log crashing through his lovely cheekbones. And while his mellifluous singing voice might have been an asset if he were only there as part of a USO tour to raise troop morale, all Timothée’s pipes are going to do belting musical numbers from Wonka out in the thick of actual combat is give the NVA a better sense of which way to direct their mortar fire. Poor guy’s probably better off just draft dodging up to Canada while he still has the chance! It’s not just Charlie that Timothée has to worry about either, because the U.S. brass will gladly rot his chiseled body with highly toxic defoliants like Agent Orange if doing so gives them even the slightest edge in their fanatic devotion to the domino theory. Then of course there’s the non-zero chance that a disgruntled fellow soldier might try to frag Timothée, especially if their sweetheart back home sends them a Dear John letter after going gaga over Timothée’s smoldering performance in The King. And even if he manages to make it through the meat grinder of asymmetric warfare physically unscathed, it’ll still leave us feeling pretty low if the boy whose goofy smile stole our heart at the movies simply stops caring about who’s a guerrilla and who’s a civilian and gives himself over to the malign indifference at the root of all human atrocity. Damn, this is some really disappointing news for Timothée Chalamet and his fans. Here’s hoping the Nixon administration ends this pointless war ASAP and brings our beautiful boy Timothée home!"
"Heartbreaking: The Dance Your 9-Year-Old Cousin Just Performed In The Living Room Was Completely Derivative—Pedestrian, Even—But You’re Way Too Old To Get Up There And Show Her What Real Tap Looks Like",N/A,https://clickhole.com/heartbreaking-the-dance-your-9-year-old-cousin-just-performed-in-the-living-room-was-completely-derivative-pedestrian-even-but-youre-way-too-old-to-get-up-there-and-show-her/,"Sadly, the scene currently unfolding in your aunt’s house is proof that age is not just a number: The dance your 9-year-old cousin just performed in the living room was completely derivative—pedestrian, even—but you’re way too old to get up there and show her what real tap looks like.  Just heartbreaking. Mere moments ago, your younger cousin Raquel interrupted the family party to show off a dance that was, if you’re being honest, one of the least original compositions you’ve ever seen, even when you account for the fact that she’s a child. Tragically, though, you’re much too old—and your knees far too creaky—to follow her performance with a better one, despite the fact that any of the double-time cramp rolls you could manage would immediately show up the half-assed shuffle ball-changes Raquel struggled through for the past two minutes. It’s frankly shocking that she thought her performance was worthy of summoning the entire family to the living room! Gah! If only you weren’t 37, but were instead 11, or even as old as 16, which is perhaps the oldest you could be while still getting away with performing your own dance afterward under the guise of “teaching her some new moves.” But at 37, with a hip bursa caused by your dedication to the art of tap no less, there’s no recourse for you but to grin and bear it, and even clap with everyone for Raquel as she bows, although you know for a fact that you still fit in your old tap shoes and recital costume—which is really, really impressive, the costume part especially—and that those items are in a box upstairs labeled “TAP,” and if you were to put them on you’d easily outshine Raquel, even though, as mentioned, you’re obviously very rusty as a result of the knee and hip issues (which would, of course, make it all the more impressive that you’re better than Raquel), but alas—you really are too old for that kind of thing. Sigh.  It really is a tragedy, though, that Raquel will now spend the rest of the night smiling with pride as though she didn’t just besmirch tap dance’s reputation with her flailing attempts at foot percussion. When you were her age, you had the decency to wait until you’d studied tap for at least a year before performing for your uncles and aunts. Where does Raquel get off thinking that three weeks of Tap 1 taught her enough to warrant stopping our conversations and moving the coffee table out of the way just to watch her stomp her feet and spin in circles? Hell, you’ve seen more inspiring performances of the Macarena than what Raquel did here today! Doesn’t Raquel realize she’s in the presence of a three time Greater Boston Area Teen Tap Contest semi-finalist? Here’s hoping she doesn’t perform an encore, as she’s only embarrassing herself. (Spoiler alert, Raquel, everyone was only clapping for you because you’re a child.)"

Yikes.  Twenty-four-year-old Jasmine Leonard of Sacramento, California has spent the past six months struggling with a terminal cancer diagnosis, and as a diehard Mr. Robot fan, she hoped desperately that she would be able to meet her favorite actor Rami Malek during her remaining time. Jasmine’s older sister wrote a Twitter post reaching out to the actor, reading, “Long shot, but my sis doesn’t have much time and a visit from Rami Malek would make her so happy. Rami, she has a poster of u and everything. Would mean the world.” The Leonard family crossed their fingers, but unfortunately, Malek responded, “Uh, ok, nice of her to ask but we def met at a Bohemian Rhapsody event in LA . Guess she forgot? Cheers to her health.” Oof, that’s rough. This is why you have to pay attention every time you meet somebody! Not wanting to let Jasmine down, her sister tried again, replying to Malek, “I get that, but meeting you is her final wish, so could u just come see her?” Unfortunately, it backfired once again, as Malek responded, “Right, but like…she got that wish. In 2020. She met me. She introduced herself as Jasmine from Sacramento, I’m 100% sure it was her. No offense but it’s kind of on her that she doesn’t remember me.” Saddened and disappointed, Jasmine’s sister then had to explain to her why Malek had declined her wish, and in an incredibly cringeworthy moment of realization she suddenly remembered shaking the actor’s hand and telling him that it was so nice to meet him. Damn, that’s harsh. Our hearts really go out to Jasmine here. Not only is she dying, but she was just made to look like a fool by her favorite celebrity. Let this be a cautionary tale to us all that when you shake hands and exchange names with someone, it’s important to commit them to memory—you never know when that information might come in handy."
Some Good News At A Dark Time: Dad’s Making Lamb Burgers!,N/A,https://clickhole.com/some-good-news-at-a-dark-time-dads-making-lamb-burgers/,"War. Recession. Climate change. Mass shootings. No one can be blamed for feeling cynical about the world right now. If you’ve been hoping for some good news for a change, you’re in luck, because this story proves that even in the darkest times, there’s always a silver lining to be found: Dad’s making lamb burgers! Absolutely beautiful! No matter how bleak things seem, news like this is enough to keep you going! In an era defined by uncertainty and chaos, coming home to find Dad shaping burger patties out of seasoned ground lamb and Mediterranean herbs is the best kind of break in the clouds anyone could hope for. While a push notification announcing the latest tragedy can ruin your day at any moment, Dad only makes lamb burgers like, once, maybe twice a year at most. Why Dad chose today of all days to shell out $15.99 per pound for ground lamb (nope, he didn’t cheap out and go to ShopRite, he went to the good butcher shop across town on his way home from work)? No one knows, but we’ll be damned if the lamb burgers, pickled red onions, and homemade tzatziki he made from a recipe he got from his super Greek coworker aren’t the perfect balm for intractable global decline. Wow. Maybe everything will be okay after all. For this brief moment, you can forget every doubt you’ve had about where the world’s heading, and whether our planet has a future worth living for at all. The only question you need to concern yourself with now is whether you’re hungry enough for one or two of Dad’s lamb burgers, because there’s enough room on the grill if you want two.

OMG! Where was a contest this cool when we were kids?!? Starting next Monday, expect the sewers to be a lot less clogged, because kids all over America will be holding in their shit for a chance to receive all the Fruity Pebbles they can eat for the rest of their lives. In order to win, all you need to do is to avoid pooping longer than any other kid in America, which will be verified by an x-ray to confirm that the amount of shit backed up in a potential winner’s colon medically correlates to how many days the contest has been going on.  In a new commercial for Fruity Pebbles, the cereal brand offers some tips for kids participating in the contest. The commercial opens with two kids writhing on the floor in pain. The boy says, “I don’t think I can hold it in much longer. I really need to poo!” The girl responds, “When you’ve got to go, just say no!” before reminding him that if you just lie there on the floor long enough, it will eventually suck back up inside of you. The boy tries to breathe through the pain for a moment before getting up and running to the bathroom. Loud farting noises commence offscreen as the girl cheers, shouting, “Oh well! More Fruity Pebbles for me!”  So cool! If you’re a parent, it’s time to set your kid down on the toilet right now and let them get it all out, because after that it might be weeks before they pinch anything else out! Post has encouraged children to stay honest and fess up if they find any tiny little turds that sneak out in their underwear, and the company has also suggested that parents check their child’s bed for feces each morning in case their child has accidentally relieved themselves during the night. The company has also specified that because there’s no fiber in Fruity Pebbles, children partaking in this contest should feel free to eat as much Fruity Pebbles as they want, as it will probably improve their chances at winning. Awesome! Get excited, kids, because a lifetime supply of Fruity Pebbles is pretty much the coolest prize you could ever win! Just squeeze that sphincter tight, ignore the abdominal pain, and imagine all the amazing rainbow-colored dumps you’re gonna take when you’re living it up with an all-Fruity Pebbles diet. This is your destiny! "
Perils Of Tech Addiction: Teens Now Spend 98% Less Time Driving Around Drunk In Corn Fields While Blasting Quiet Riot Than In The ‘80s,N/A,https://clickhole.com/perils-of-tech-addiction-teens-now-spend-98-less-time-driving-around-drunk-in-corn-fields-while-blasting-quiet-riot-than-in-the-80s/,"As if we needed any more proof that excessive smartphone use is unhealthy for kids, new research has laid bare the very real consequences of our screen-addicted society: A study found that teens now spend 98 percent less time driving around drunk in corn fields while blasting Quiet Riot than they did in the ‘80s. Yikes. Technology is clearly having a devastating impact on children. A new study by researchers at Rutgers University compared how often today’s teens reported getting wasted on Blatz and ripping it up in corn fields while cranking Quiet Riot to how often teens did in the ‘80s. While teenagers in the ‘80s averaged five hours a month doing burnouts while shitfaced in muddy-ass corn fields with “Metal Health” cranked, today’s teens reported hardly doing that at all. The study also found a dramatic decrease in time today’s teens spend participating in similar activities such as shooting out headlights with BB guns at the scrapyard, giving one another shitty tattoos of pot leaves, lighting ponds on fire with gasoline, and stealing cigarettes from Kmart. “We’ve known for years about the negative impact of screen addiction on children, but this data highlighting the drastic generational drop-off in kids blasting ‘Cum On Feel The Noize’ while drunkenly mowing down stalks of corn gives us a grim new understanding of just how damaging devices can be to young people’s mental and emotional development,” said lead researcher Allison Lee. “And it’s not just maniacally barreling through corn fields in their mom’s sedan that they’re missing out on. An alarmingly high percentage of today’s kids have never even hidden a soggy stack of Hustlers and a bong in the woods along the railroad tracks or huffed model glue while carving Mötley Crüe lyrics into their arms with a razor. If these worrying trends continue, it might not be long before smartphones have robbed an entire generation of pivotal formative experiences like getting fucked-up on half-frozen Burnett’s peach vodka and Sprite in a friend’s garage before heading out for a night of high-speed hellraising with the windows down and the opening guitar part of Van Halen’s ‘Eruption’ blaring at max volume.” “Instead of critical social milestones like ganging up on dweebs to dunk their heads in toilets and breaking into abandoned houses to make out with freshman girls, today’s teens are largely spending their time chatting with friends on their phones and watching videos about things they’re interested in—and this should make parents very worried,” Lee continued. “The loss of these crucial childhood experiences has undoubtedly fueled the extreme increase in anxiety and depression we’ve observed in teens over the past decade.” Depressing. This should be all the proof you need that kids shouldn’t have smartphones.  Imagine growing up without even once experiencing the magic of blasting Twisted Sister in your Trans Am with the sunroof open while going 60 through seven-foot stalks of corn and nursing your sixth Leinenkugel’s of the night. Sadly, that’s the reality most of today’s teenagers are living in. It’s disturbing to say the least, and unless parents can find a way to better manage their kids’ relationships with technology, we might just have to resign ourselves to the fact that children will no longer have real childhoods shaped by the destruction of private property and hair metal.

A Well-Deserved Honor: Kacey Musgraves Is Finally Going To Be Launched Into The Country Music Hall Of Fame,N/A,https://clickhole.com/a-well-deserved-honor-kacey-musgraves-is-finally-going-to-be-launched-into-the-country-music-hall-of-fame/,"Every country musician dreams of the day they’ll receive their chosen genre’s highest honor, and for one beloved star, that day has now arrived: Kacey Musgraves is finally going to be launched into the Country Music Hall Of Fame! Yes!! You go girl! After numerous Grammy wins and multiple critically acclaimed records, Kacey Musgraves’ incredible career will be commemorated at her Country Music Hall Of Fame Launching Ceremony held in Tennessee next week. The “Space Cowboy” singer will receive the honor of a lifetime as she climbs into the very same catapult that her heroes Loretta Lynn and John Prine once packed themselves into, at which point she’ll be flung toward the Nashville Country Music Hall of Fame building just like all of the other country greats before her! The event will surely be a day to remember for Kacey, as her hero Willie Nelson will perform the customary launching anthem “”The Brightest Stars Belong In The Sky” before guest of honor Emmylou Harris pulls the catapult’s lever and sends her flying through the air. One can only imagine how much it will mean to the Grammy winner as she slams headfirst into the monument that represents the best talents in country music, cementing her rightful place among them both in history and on the side of the building. Congratulations, Kacey! You’ve truly earned it! Expect many country music fans to be staring up at the clouds next Friday as they hope to catch a glimpse of one of their favorite singers torpedoing over the Nashville skyline. Pro-tip: due to a forecasted northwest headwind, Kacey is projected to land on the western side of the Hall of Fame, likely sandwiched between country legends Reba McEntire and Garth Brooks. So if you want to check her out, that’s where to look! This is so cool! It’s so exciting to see a living legend receive such a high honor. It’s been a long time coming, and Kacey definitely deserves it!"

"Who Knew? When This Family Looked Through Their Late Grandmother’s Photo Albums, They Saw She Used To Have A Giraffe-Like Neck And Rolled With A Giraffe-Necked Crew",N/A,https://clickhole.com/who-knew-when-this-family-looked-through-their-late-grandmothers-photo-albums-they-saw-she-used-to-have-a-giraffe-like-neck-and-rolled-with-a-giraffe-necked-crew/,"Sometimes people can keep surprising you even after they’re gone, and some old pictures have provided one family with a fascinating window into a previously unknown chapter of a loved one’s life: When this family looked through their late grandmother’s photo albums, they saw she used to have a giraffe-like neck and rolled with a giraffe-necked crew. Wow, imagine stumbling on a totally forgotten piece of family history like that! Last week, the living members of the Holt family recently decided to mark the two-year anniversary of their beloved Grandma Esther’s death by opening up some old photo albums they’d found tucked away in a trunk while cleaning out her attic, hoping the photos might rekindle their gradually dimming memories of her. But instead of finding only the reserved, normally proportioned woman they’d known in life, they were stunned to discover a number of early photographs showing their grandma as a carefree, giraffe-necked young twenty-something, running with a tight-knit set of friends all sporting elongate, giraffe-like necks of their own. This came as quite a shock, since neither she nor their grandfather had ever mentioned anything about her having a swaying, four-and-a-half foot long neck before, though considering that Grampa Dave doesn’t appear in any of these photos, it’s possible that he too was in the dark about his wife’s giraffe-necked past. The photos paint a vivid picture of a giraffe-necked young woman in love with the world and her giraffe-necked squad. In one, their smiling grandmother skates between two of her giraffe-necked gal pals at an outdoor rink, her gigantic neck wrapped in no fewer than 12 different scarves. In another, the whole crew assembles around three giraffe-necked young men in naval uniforms, a strikingly celebratory sendoff for what signs visible through the forest of their long necks suggest will be service in WWII’s European theater. And in one particularly intriguing photo labeled “Esther + Bob,” their grandmother stands with the handsomest of those three servicemen, here sporting a sharp suit with a huge, sailboat-like collar, and cranes her massive neck over to light a cigarette off a match the man tenderly holds aloft for her. Of course the Holts know their grandmother would go on to have a normal neck and marry Grampa Dave somewhere around 1948, but given how closely the man’s other arm holds her waist, it’s not hard to imagine that this giraffe-necked mystery man could have been their giraffe-necked grandfather if things had gone just a little differently. There’s so much they must wish they could ask her about her days in the giraffe-necked scene! You’ve got to wonder what exactly made their late grandmother give up the giraffe-necked life: whether it was some personal tragedy, or a falling out with her giraffe-necked gang, or simply the sense that it was time to grow up and put the frivolities of her giraffe-necked lifestyle behind her. People change, sure, but she looked so happy to be rolling with that giraffe-necked pack. Did she never mention it because she was embarrassed? Or were the memories of her giraffe-necked youth, teetering around town with her head scraping ceilings and getting lost among the tree branches, so unbearably dear to her that it was all she could do to hide them away in the attic and try her best to forget? Damn, the Holt family never would have known that their quiet little grandmother used to rock a crazy-long giraffe neck if not for these photo albums. It just goes to show that you never really know what kind of amazing secrets a person’s past might hold!"
"Go, Girl! Grandma Just Drove Her Walker Into A Display Of Pickles At The Grocery Store And Then Walked Away Like Nothing Happened",N/A,https://clickhole.com/go-girl-grandma-just-drove-her-walker-into-a-display-of-pickles-at-the-grocery-store-and-then-walked-away-like-nothing-happened/,"Going out in public with Grandma is always a dicey proposition, but she just did something so completely epic at Safeway that we think we’re gonna have to take her shopping more often: Grandma just drove her walker into a display of pickles and then walked away like nothing happened! Zero. Fucks. Given. You go, queen! Just a few minutes ago, Grandma reached the end of the cereal aisle and spied the deli counter, where she was hoping to buy some turkey for sandwiches, and in her excitement, she managed to overlook the fact that she was waddling straight towards a pyramidal display of Vlasic pickles until it was too late. Her eyes trained on the deli guy cutting ham, she rammed into the pickles at full speed, sending jar upon jar tumbling to the ground in a great commotion. But Grandma, unfazed by all the broken glass and pickle juice on the ground, merely mumbled “Oh,” turned her walker 45 degrees to the right, and continued advancing to the deli counter as if she had not just destroyed upwards of $70 worth of pickles. When the deli guy then pointed out the mess as she approached the counter, Grandma just glanced at the pickles and said “Something must have happened” before asking for a pound of low-sodium turkey breast sliced extra thin. Now a young grocery worker has come over with some disinfectant and rags, asking Grandma if she’d like him to wipe the pickle juice off of her walker, and Grandma has responded that, yes, she would like him to clean her walker, and also that she thinks it’s a shame how filthy the store has gotten in recent years, gesturing towards the broken pickle jars with disgust as if she wasn’t clearly the one who caused the chaos in the first place. But with her low-sodium turkey now obtained, all she needs to do now is grab some wafer cookies and club crackers before getting on with her day.  Grandma simply doesn’t give a shit!  After spending the entire ride to the grocery store complaining about how hot it was outside, then complaining in the grocery store about how the AC was too cold and also how the store was filthy, we can’t wait to hear what Grandma complains about next. Whatever it is, we are 100 percent here for it, because Grandma is an absolute queen, and we are awed by her blatant disregard for everyone and everything around her. You rule, Grandma!"
Well WTF Are We Supposed To Do? Body Language Scientists Have Determined That Not Making Eye Contact And Making Eye Contact Are Both Equally Awkward,N/A,https://clickhole.com/well-wtf-are-we-supposed-to-do-body-language-scientists-have-determined-that-not-making-eye-contact-and-making-eye-contact-are-both-equally-awkward/,"Body language is an incredibly important but frequently overlooked aspect of human interaction, and it can play a huge role in how you are perceived by others. Unfortunately, body language experts recently admitted that they simply can’t provide us with any answers as to where we should be looking when talking to other people: They’ve issued a new report claiming that making eye contact and not making eye contact are both equally awkward.  Wow. This is not helpful at all! Behind the new assertion is a report by a panel of body language experts assembled by Brown University, who analyzed thousands of social interactions during which study participants made varying amounts of eye contact with their conversation partners. The analysis determined that while failing to make eye contact makes you appear like a disinterested, ashamed weirdo who’s probably too busy lost in thought about sick sexual fantasies to be engaged in conversation, making direct eye makes you seem like a coked-up vampire who’s trying to suck the life out of everyone around you through your eyes. Evolutionary biologists have long theorized that humans evolved expressive eyes in order to communicate visually prior to the development of language, but this study suggests that your eyes are only capable of communicating one of two things: either that you are a psychopath who derives sick satisfaction from invading others’ psyches with your gaze, or that you are a sad, pathetic worm who has no business showing your face in public, let alone attempting to speak to other human beings. “If you’ve ever felt unsure of where you should be looking during a conversation because all options feel equally awkward, that’s because they are,” said panel head Jerome Kennedy. “Our research has shown that you can look someone right in the eyes, look at the tip of their nose, look over their shoulder at a picture on the wall behind them, look down at your feet, or keep your eyes closed, but no matter what, that interaction is going to feel somehow wrong. Maybe if there were some way to remove eyes from the equation altogether we could give some guidance on how to have a personal interaction that isn’t painful and confusing, but the best advice we’ve got right now is to stick to email or FaceTime audio.” Well, all we can say is thanks for nothing, experts. Guess we’ll just have to continue looking total strangers directly in the eyes when saying “thank you” at the gas station but refusing to make eye contact with the people we have sex with, just like we always have. Keep swirling your eyes around and trying different things when talking to people, we guess, as no matter what you do with your eyes, science says it’s going to feel like shit. "
"Fascinating: After A 20-Year Study Into Why Men Are Crazy For Bitches, Harvard Researchers Have Determined It’s Because Bitches Are Crazy As Fuck",N/A,https://clickhole.com/fascinating-after-a-20-year-study-into-why-men-are-crazy-for-bitches-harvard-researchers-have-determined-its-because-bitches-are-crazy-as-fuck/,"When it comes to love and relationships, it’s not always clear why people do the things they do, but thanks do an enlightening new study, we now have an answer to one of the biggest mysteries of dating: After a 20-year study into why men are crazy for bitches, Harvard researchers have determined that it’s because bitches are crazy as fuck. Wow. So THAT’S why men go ga-ga for bitches! For the past two decades, Harvard sociologists have been carefully tracking a cohort of 89 men between the ages of 18 and 22 in order to better understand why many of these men would drool over the some of the most hot-tempered, completely insane females imaginable, preferring types of bitches who would slash your tires for forgetting to call them back over bitches of a more buttoned-up, demure variety. Twenty years later, the researchers have now concluded that men love said crazy bitches because they are straight-up nuts, rather than despite their being observably loco in the coco. Early on, the sociologists predicted that perhaps some of these young men were drawn to bitches who displayed high-strung temperaments that mirrored their own youthful ardor, or that they were briefly tempted by the prospect of dating a freaky red-haired kleptomaniac who was crazy in the sack but would later reconsider and move on to the kind of girl you could bring home to Mom and Dad. However, the researchers were surprised to find that the opposite was true, with the subjects of the study maintaining durable, longstanding inclinations towards wild women who are nothing but trouble, consistently expressing over 20 years that they would be “very likely” to pursue a dinner date with any given “crazy-ass ho,” “very unlikely” to be put off when said ho started “screaming and throwing her napkin on the ground and threatening to kill his exes with her steak knife,” and finally, “very likely” to feel “surprisingly excited by the fact that their new girl had come to bang on their apartment door in the middle of the night and beg for forgiveness, then ask to fuck in the backseat of her Corolla before driving to her paralegal job at a law firm she steals from.” It eventually became crystal clear that the men’s persistent pull towards the craziness of bitches was not incidental, but rather a necessary and even sole condition of their attraction. Researchers further confirmed this hypothesis by measuring the brain activity of their subjects when presented with alternating images of regular, kind ladies, like Anna Kendrick and Glinda the Good Witch, and of certified crazy bitches, like Naomi Watts’ character in Mulholland Drive and Rachel Dolezal. Activity in the brain regions responsible for both love and attraction spiked dramatically when shown an image of a woman rated “highly fucked in the head” on the Harvard researchers’ “Totally Nuts Slut” scale, strongly indicating that men don’t just like crazy bitches, but they absolutely fucking love them. Wow! What a fascinating glimpse into the science of attraction! If you’re a woman looking for a mate, you might want to consider being a raging, belligerent bitch, and if you’re a man looking for one, you might want to get ready to get scratched in the face by some very long nails, because that, it turns out, is exactly what your heart wants."
Intriguing: These Autographed Headshots Of C-List Celebrities Behind This Rotting Deer Carcass Suggests That They’ve Eaten There,N/A,https://clickhole.com/intriguing-these-autographed-headshots-of-c-list-celebrities-behind-this-rotting-deer-carcass-suggests-that-theyve-eaten-there/,"If you’re looking for a trendy place to eat that attracts the glitterati, it looks like there’s a hot new destination to check out: These autographed headshots of celebrities hanging behind this rotting deer carcass suggests that they’ve eaten there. Intriguing. It’s not exactly Spago, but it nonetheless appears to be a magnet for the rich and famous. The decaying corpse of the deer, which is located in the middle of the woods, has been visibly picked over by numerous scavengers, and judging from the autographed headshots nailed to the trees around it, many of those scavengers are moderately famous pop culture figures from all corners of the entertainment industry!  Directly above the deer is a framed picture of Lorne Michaels with the hand-written message, “I loved the meat. I feasted on this death and then went to work. – Lorne Michaels.” Right next to Michaels is a signed headshot of Rachel McAdams with the handwritten message, “I ate the neck and it tasted like a fabulous flavor.” These are just two of the dozens of pictures of well-known people who have evidently feasted on the decaying flesh of this lifeless beast in the forest, which is crawling with bugs and maggots that have been attracted by its horrific odor.  Other celebrities who have their photos nailed to the trees around the deer carcass include Geraldo Rivera, Kristin Cavallari, Chris Kattan, and John Mellencamp, the latter of whom left a kind message reading, “Best carrion I’ve had in years! I ate its sightless eyes. Rock on! – John Cougar Mellencamp.” Perhaps most exciting, there’s a photo featuring all the members of BTS on their hands and knees tearing flesh off the dead deer’s bones with their teeth! The BTS photo is inscribed with the message, “We are the Taste The Deer generation. Remember to always have love and to sustain yourself on the decay of other life. Love, BTS.” So cool!  If you want to encounter a celeb, it seems all you need to do is venture deep into the forest and follow the scent of rotting flesh. And be sure to check it out soon, because chances are it won’t be long before this decomposing animal is the hottest table in town!"
"When One Sense Is Lessened, The Others Become Superhumanly Heightened: When This Boy Removes His Glasses At Bedtime He Can Hear His Parents Argue About Money",N/A,https://clickhole.com/when-one-sense-is-lessened-the-others-become-superhumanly-heightened-when-this-boy-removes-his-glasses-at-bedtime-he-can-hear-his-parents-argue-about-money/,"There comes a day in every superhero’s life where they realize they’ve been given incredible powers. One such boy in Columbus, OH has just learned of his fantastic capabilities, and now it is up to him to harness them for good: When this boy removes his glasses at bedtime, he can hear his parents argue about money. Holy cow! As he sacrifices his sight… his hearing becomes supersonic! A month ago, it seemed like any old night for eight-year-old Lionel Potakis. He put on the Cleveland Browns pajamas he’d gotten for Christmas, climbed into bed, and took off his glasses. But just as his sight waned, his auditory senses suddenly came into focus. Soon, he began to hear the strangest sounds: his mother saying, “Don’t you think we should be putting something away for retirement?” followed by the sound of his father’s fist hitting the table as he said, “And how the hell are we going to do that, Janet?” Confused, Lionel popped his glasses back on and headed toward his door to check out what was happening downstairs—but that’s when he realized that with the glasses on, the noises had stopped!  The same scene has played out every night since. At first, Lionel could hear only snippets of his parent’s arguments: “The shit you order on Amazon adds up!”; “Well, maybe don’t run the goddamn heat all day!”; “I don’t know, Matt—it was your idea to have four kids, so why don’t you fucking figure out how to pay for their doctor visits?” But as Lionel has learned to dig deep and really focus on listening without his glasses on, he’s heard even more. Just the other night, Lionel heard an uninterrupted 10-minute conversation about trying to save money by changing car insurance companies, followed by the slamming of a door and an admission from his mother that if Dad were more like his brother, none of this would even be a problem. Wow! This boy truly has a gift! Since discovering his powers, Lionel has tested their limits in several different scenarios. But whether he took his glasses off at school, in the car, or at the dinner table, it didn’t make a difference. The noises only come at night in his bed with his glasses off. Lionel even asked his older sister if she’d ever heard any “super sounds” at night, to which she responded, “Like what? Your own farts?” confirming that Lionel is the only one in his family with this gift—and maybe even the world. But is his amazing hearing a gift, or a curse? At McDonald’s last week, Lionel realized that his favorite item, Chicken Selects, was more expensive than regular old McNuggets. Due to his special powers, he knew his Mom felt that “this family doesn’t have any extra spending money, and if we did, we wouldn’t spend it on a goddamn lawn mower.” Faced with this knowledge, Lionel ordered the McNuggets, and even when his Mom said “Really? But you always get the Selects,” Lionel insisted on the cheaper option as he finally understood that the reason he was given this super hearing ability in the first place was to single handedly save his family from financial ruin. How brave of this boy! It’s true that with great power comes great responsibility, but it seems like Lionel is up for the challenge. Well done, Lionel! "

Nice! Sometimes it’s best to just be completely oblivious to things.  Getting a positive result on a pregnancy test can be incredibly stressful: You have to stop drinking, start worrying about financially supporting another human being, schedule countless doctor appointments, and grapple with the realization that your life is going to drastically change forever. But thankfully, Clearblue’s new pregnancy test will display a question mark whether it detects hCG in the user’s urine or not, so that they can simply continue enjoying their lives with a clean conscience and zero awareness of what’s happening in their womb.  Clearblue says that their test is best used between the first five and 20 weeks of a potential pregnancy, but it will do its job throughout a pregnant woman’s full term as long as they are willing to believe that maybe they’re gaining weight due to over-snacking, or missing their period due to stress. “Why worry about the possibility of a fully formed, helpless human being coming into your life and completely changing everything when you could just not worry about things and keep having fun?” said the company in a press release. “Don’t curse yourself with the knowledge of impending parenthood. Just use Clearblue’s zero-information pregnancy tests. Que sera sera, y’know?” Sounds great! These new pregnancy tests are going to be a serious game-changer for those who may or may not be pregnant. The days of worrying about what’s happening in your body are over! "
"Ah, Shit: That Weird Guy You Went To High School With Just Broke His Neck In A Car Accident And Ripping On Him Was The Only Thread Still Holding Your Friend Group Together ",N/A,https://clickhole.com/ah-shit-that-weird-guy-you-went-to-high-school-with-just-broke-his-neck-in-a-car-accident-and-ripping-on-him-was-the-only-thread-still-holding-your-friend-group-together/,"Staying in touch with old friends only seems to only get harder as we age, and unfortunately for you and your high school friends, it looks like it’s about to get much harder: That weird guy you went to high school with just broke his neck in a car accident and ripping on him was the only thread still holding your friend group together.  Dammit. What the hell are you going to talk about now? Since graduating high school in 2006, you and your formerly tight-knit crew of buddies have been gradually growing further and further apart. Your once annoyingly active group chat is now mostly silent, but there’s one thing that never fails to reignite the conversation: seeing Trent Pershing, the really weird guy from your high school, make weird posts on social media. Whether he’s posting selfies of himself in his goofy-ass homemade steampunk costumes, or typo-laden screeds about women never wanting to date the nice guys, or bafflingly religious Snoopy memes, everything he shares immediately gets screencapped and passed around your group chat. But all of that is about to change, as, sadly, you just got news that Trent broke his neck in a terrible car accident, meaning you can no longer make fun of him because it’d be a dick move to make fun of a paralyzed person. When the news was announced to your group chat, it was followed by a chorus of “holy shit” and “fuck!” texts which could be taken as both concern for Trent and anger over no longer being able to rip on him, although probably more the latter, as what the hell are you all supposed to talk about now? Your careers? Having families? That’s just not gonna happen. Without your collective fascination over Trent, your friendship has nothing.  Well, fuck. Looks like it’s the end of an era. Though Trent is thankfully going to live, the sobering reality is that, without being able to rip on him in good conscience any longer, your high school friendships will likely die. In retrospect, maybe you’ve been a little hard on ol’ Trent over the years, but to be fair, 1) making fun of him brought you countless hours of joy and it was literally the only thing keeping you in touch with your old best friends, and 2) he’s a pretty goddamn weird dude. Hopefully you and your old friends are able to find something else to talk about, but let’s be honest, it’s probably not gonna happen."
Greatness Doesn’t Take An Off-Day: This 9-Year-Old Athlete Even Wears His Under Armour Shirt To Church,N/A,https://clickhole.com/greatness-doesnt-take-an-off-day-this-9-year-old-athlete-even-wears-his-under-armour-shirt-to-church/,"In the pursuit of greatness, there are no shortcuts or half measures, only a single-minded commitment to one’s goal, and here’s a story of a boy who’s truly pulling out all the stops to reach the top: This nine-year-old athlete even wears his Under Armour shirt to church.  Damn. This kid is not messing around. For as long as he can remember, fourth-grader Toby Fahlen has dreamed of being a professional football player, as well as a professional baseball player and a WWE wrestler and a UFC fighter—and while these may be lofty ambitions, there’s no denying that he is putting in the work. Not only does Toby do 50 pushups and 50 situps every day along with 40-lb bench press sets on his dad’s Bowflex, but he also stays constantly ready to compete, sporting his Under Armour UA Tech 2.0 Nova training shirt and Under Armour running shoes at all times so that, should there ever be a need for his athletic skills at church, school, or while running errands with his mom, he’s prepared to perform at the highest level.  Strutting into the foyer at Covenant Presbyterian Church each Sunday, Toby can practically feel the eyes of the other congregants admiring his Under Armour-accentuated muscles. “He’s only a fourth grader but he looks as strong as a middle schooler,” he imagines them whispering to one another. “It’s so cool how he made the travel baseball team on his very first try.”  While his mom has argued that there’s no reason for him to wear his Under Armour shirt to church if he’s not playing sports, she fails to realize that the shirt’s stretchy, form-fitting fabric allows him to bound up the church stairs four steps at a time without constricting his movement, and its moisture-wicking properties help him quickly dry off after working up a sweat playing Bible-themed games during Sunday school. She also doesn’t seem to understand that pretty much every pro athlete in the world wears Under Armour, and if Toby is going to grow up to be a multi-sport pro athlete as he intends to, he obviously needs to be wearing Under Armour, too. SMDH. Toby’s mom clearly has no clue what it takes to be the best. Toby may only be nine, but his commitment to doing whatever it takes to achieve greatness—even wearing the same shirt day in and day out, despite it absolutely reeking of prepubescent B.O.—should be an inspiration to everyone, no matter their age. The NFL, MLB, WWE, and UFC better look out, because it won’t be long before Toby comes to take them all by storm."
"Think White Guys Can’t Rap? Think Again. His Name Is Eminem, And He’s Got A Beat That Just Might Make You Dance—And Think.",N/A,https://clickhole.com/think-white-guys-cant-rap-think-again-his-name-is-eminem-and-hes-got-a-beat-that-just-might-make-you-dance-and-think/,"If you picture a white guy from the Midwest, you might imagine him watching a baseball game or heading to a church potluck—but certainly not rapping. Then again, you’ve most likely never met Marshall Mathers, a.k.a. Eminem, a white rapper whose beats can make you dance just as much as his lyrics can make you think. Has rapping gone colorblind? Eminem is making a strong case for it. Eminem certainly doesn’t fit the mold of most rappers you see on the cover of XXL. He was born in the heavily Caucasian state of Missouri, he’s got close-cropped hair that would look more at home in a boardroom than at a rap battle, and he’s even named himself after M&Ms, a candy widely enjoyed by white people. He might not have sold crack cocaine like Jay-Z or grown up in Compton like Kendrick Lamar, but that hasn’t stopped “the real Slim Shady” from cooking up rap albums that the likes of Tupac, Biggie, and Queen Latifah would have to give “props” if they were alive today. The genius rhymester has penned lyrics that encapsulate elements of the white experience that range from watching “two trailer park girls go round the outside” to divorcing someone named Kim to throwing up spaghetti, and if his CD sales are any indication, America is tapping its toes right along with his beats. Play that funky music, white boy! Eminem is “straight fire”! The rap establishment has clearly accepted Eminem, given that his mentor is notable artist and producer Andre Romell Young a.k.a. Dr. Dre, an African-American man whose songs are greatly influential in the hip-hop community. But certified honkies love him, too. It might be Eminem’s message, which exhorts his fans to “lose yourself in the music, the moment / you own it, you better never let it go,” that compels them to look past the color of his skin and appreciate the content of his songs. His bass-heavy ditties inspire partiers to “report to the dance floor,” but his mile-a-minute raps take on heavy topics like hating your mom and being repeatedly cheated on, and it’s that combination that makes Eminem a winning emcee behind the microphone.  Eminem may rap that “y’all act like you never seen a white person before,” but as more and more people check out his music, not only are they seeing a white person, but one who can groove at that! Go ahead and lose yourself in some of his rap music today. We don’t think you’ll regret it!"
"A Failure Of The System On Every Level: Millions Of Americans Live In Poverty, And Millions More Have Tons Of Money But Also Seem Sad And Negative All The Time",N/A,https://clickhole.com/a-failure-of-the-system-on-every-level-millions-of-americans-live-in-poverty-and-millions-more-have-tons-of-money-but-also-seem-sad-and-negative-all-the-time/,"If you feel like our leaders have let you down, you’re far from alone, because countless Americans from all walks of life are suffering under an untenable status quo: Millions of Americans live in poverty, and millions more have tons of money but also seem sad and negative all the time. Shameful. Rich or poor, Americans deserve better than this! You’d never know that America is the richest country in the world looking at the vast number of citizens just barely scraping by and going to bed hungry, and to make matters worse, just as many affluent Americans still seem gloomy and morose in spite of their absurd amounts of wealth. Our country has let these people fall through the cracks, abandoning them to either eke out desperate lives on the margins of society or look completely fucking miserable picking at the lobster tail their personal chef made for them. The food insecure single mother living out of her car may not outwardly resemble the blinged-out finance mogul slumped listlessly over his jet ski, but in their downcast, distant expressions lies a unifying trauma: the broken promise of the American Dream. What makes these systemic breakdowns so deeply infuriating is the ample evidence that it doesn’t have to be this way. Plenty of European countries have redistributive tax policies to facilitate government programs alleviating poverty, and their active, way healthier-looking rich people also seem genuinely psyched to be buying Formula 1 teams and strutting around in Armani suits. Hell, even the America of days past had some robust social safety nets and an upper crust that looked like they were riding high on one never-ending, champagne-soaked bacchanal, but a couple decades of indifferent politicians plus bad vibes at the country club and that all slipped away. You’ve got to wonder how our elected officials can sleep at night when somewhere out there a homeless veteran is freezing to death in the streets, and somewhere else a pissed off Fortune 500 CEO is having a loud argument with his wife courtside at a Lakers game, but the sad fact is, our leaders stopped caring about those people a long, long time ago. The poor work 80+ hour weeks just to stay alive, and the people exploiting them are still always in a terrible mood. Some fucking country we are! “You see so many tents out there under the overpasses, and so many rich people acting incredibly bummed out and pessimistic all the time,” said Kevin Gertler, an LA limo driver whose occupation offers him a sobering view of the troubles plaguing both ends of the American wealth spectrum. “I drive this real estate magnate who doesn’t even seem to taste the caviar he’s eating, who gives rueful little laughs and mutters ‘Fat fucking chance’ when I tell him to have a good day, but nobody in the government ever does anything about it or tries to cheer him up. He’s as invisible to the system as the people he evicts. Our school books, our movies, they always told us that having all that money is supposed to be fun, but in the end, I guess the America where anyone can make it and those who make it really big are super fulfilled and upbeat was just another lie.” Damn. It seems like this country is fundamentally broken. It’s time for our leaders to realize that no American should ever be wondering where their next meal is going to come from or looking bored and unhappy with their cartoonish accumulation of wealth! "
A Wonderful Update: The American Society For Microbiology Just Announced That All Those Tiny Little Guys Are Doing Just Fine,N/A,https://clickhole.com/a-wonderful-update-the-american-society-for-microbiology-just-announced-that-all-those-tiny-little-guys-are-doing-just-fine/,"With so much violence, bigotry, and death running rampant across the globe, it can sometimes seem like there’s absolutely nothing to be cheerful about. But an uplifting new report is bringing a little bit of sunshine into this dark and scary world: The American Society For Microbiology just announced that all those tiny little guys are doing just fine. Wonderful! It’s so nice to hear some good news for a change. Following an extensive multi-year study into the wellbeing of Earth’s smallest life forms, a panel of leading microbiology researchers from around the country have concluded that the world’s trillions of microscopic organisms—including bacteria, fungi, and the cheerful little protozoa—are continuing to swim around and be very small and are just having a great time eating each other and bumping into each other and splitting themselves in half in order to make replicas of themselves. Despite the endless suffering facing humanity and the profound destruction of natural habitats occurring around the globe, the study found that things largely continue to be just peachy keen for the germs, spores, and tiny little critters of the world. Key takeaways from the research indicate that in places like swamps, bathrooms, and human mouths, billions upon billions of wee small little creatures are wriggling around aimlessly and swallowing one another, which are basically the two activities they love doing the most. The researchers also cited “compelling statistical evidence” that “if germs had mouths, they would be smiling all the time.” The study goes on to confirm that things will probably continue to go well for our planet’s tiny little guys, and that the health and safety of organisms like E. coli and amoebas remain largely unaffected by things like the war in Ukraine or America’s struggles with gun violence.  “Even when there is a disaster like a tornado, germs are usually like, ‘whatever,’ and continue cloning themselves and bouncing around inside your belly and the bellies of your family members,” the study’s authors concluded. “These guys, the ones that are too small to see, they’re fine. Don’t worry about them. They’re just tiny, tiny people living their best lives with no stress or hassle.” This is so great to hear!  In a world where there’s never a shortage of alarming news to be troubled by, it’s incredibly encouraging knowing that things are at least going pretty well at the microscopic level. Here’s hoping the rest of the planet’s living beings can take a cue from these happy little buddies and lead better, more fulfilling lives."
Heartwarming: These Kayakers Saved A Dolphin That Had Gotten Its G-String Caught On Some Fishing Line,N/A,https://clickhole.com/heartwarming-these-kayakers-saved-a-dolphin-that-had-gotten-its-g-string-caught-on-some-fishing-line/,"Humans are so often irresponsible when they interact with the natural world, so it’s heartwarming to see a story like this one, where a group of people go above and beyond to save an animal’s life: These kayakers saved a dolphin that had gotten its g-string caught on some fishing line, So amazing! Kristen Wheeler and Devin Marks were halfway through a daylong kayaking trip at the Timucuan Ecological and Historic Preserve in Jacksonville, Florida yesterday when they heard a loud, distressed cry, which they soon realized was coming from an adult bottlenose dolphin whose lacy black underwear had snagged on a length of tackle left behind by a fisherman. As Kristen and Devin neared the panicked dolphin, it became clear that the animal had struggled to free itself from its own sexy g-string, writhing around in such a way that the thong strap got wrapped around one of its fins, making it impossible for it to swim. Working quickly, Kristen and Devin put down their oars and helped the dolphin out of its Skims brand thong, revealing a cut in its dorsal fin carved by the underwear’s tight polyester strap. Wow, this could’ve turned out MUCH worse—thank god Kristen and Devin were around to help avert a tragedy! The dolphin quickly swam away after Kristen and Devin freed it, and they made sure to remove both the excess fishing line and the g-string from the water so that no further dolphins would suffer the same fate. Unfortunately, not every dolphin will have good samaritans nearby when it gets its panties caught in some refuse left behind by careless humans, so it’s important that we all do better and make sure to leave no trace when we visit natural environments. In the meantime, we can give thanks for people like Kristen and Devin who step up and do the right thing when they encounter an animal snared in its own sexy undergarments. "
Do They Think We’re Stupid? This Zoo Is Trying To Pass A Bunch Of Sheep Off Like They’re Rare Enough For A Separate Exhibit,N/A,https://clickhole.com/do-they-think-were-stupid-this-zoo-is-trying-to-pass-a-bunch-of-sheep-off-like-theyre-rare-enough-for-a-separate-exhibit/,"Some people think they can get away with anything, and what should have been a nice morning excursion has just been ruined by a brazen insult to our intelligence: This zoo is trying to pass a bunch of sheep off like they’re rare enough for a separate exhibit. C’mon, we weren’t born yesterday. Get the fuck out of here with this shit! We were just coming off a fun stroll through the zoo’s reptile house and were trying to decide where to go next when we noticed a big sign pointing to our right that said “SHEEP: The Emperors Of The Hills.” Now at first, we figured this was a sign destined for the zoo’s Petting Barn attraction that an absentminded employee had simply set down and forgotten along the way. Surely if we head down this path we’ll find a bonafide zoo A-lister like gorillas or giraffes, we thought, trying to be charitable and assuming this all was just a silly mistake. But it turns out that level of respect is not something the zoo feels like showing us in return, because what we ended up finding was a standalone exhibit characterizing sheep as some kind of exotic marvel instead of the ubiquitous barnyard animal that anyone with half a brain can recognize as such. Top to bottom, this sheep exhibit just oozes condescension toward the zoo’s paying customers. For one thing, describing the sheep as “emperors of the hills” implies a certain grandeur that these shit-smeared doofuses clearly don’t possess, as though they’re noble creatures from a far-off land and not just right there moseying on the side of the highway anytime you drive through even remotely rural areas. Also, the exhibit’s reading materials mention a dedicated “resident sheep biologist” in charge of replicating the sheeps’ habitat and diet, like those things are complex topics that require specialized knowledge and not just “a lot of fucking grass” and “a lot of fucking grass,” respectively. Perhaps most insultingly, these aren’t even a particularly rare kind of sheep. They’re the most basic, garden-variety sheep there are! There’s not even a specific breed or taxonomic delineation on the informational placards—they literally just say that they’re “sheep” with no specificity beyond that. But the zoo seems to think we’ll clap like trained seals for pretty much any four-legged animal they trot out in front of us, even if that animal is just domesticated livestock whose meat we could buy at a goddamn Costco. These assholes aren’t fooling anybody! The sheep enclosure’s elaborate construction and sizable acreage make it painfully obvious that this exhibit should have been some kind of showstopper like big cats or elephants, but the zoo just couldn’t line up a draw quite that eye-catching. Which is fair enough! We can appreciate that plans fall through sometimes, but they could have at least been honest about it instead of treating us like credulous rubes who believe sheep are the height of curiosity. We might as well just head for the parking lot now, because even cool, legitimately rare animals like the sugar gliders aren’t going to be able to pull us out of the funk we’re in knowing just how little the zoo really thinks of us. Sheep? Really? What a fucking joke.  We really, really do not enjoy being treated like this. Here’s hoping the zoo gets their shit together and never tries to pull another stunt like this again! "
"Grooming, Temperament, Exercise Needs, And More Information You Need To Care For Joy Behar",N/A,https://clickhole.com/grooming-temperament-exercise-needs-and-more-information-you-need-to-care-for-joy-behar/,"So, you’ve decided to become Joy Behar’s primary caretaker. While it’s certainly going to be a major responsibility, it’s also going to be an incredibly rewarding experience. If you’re up for the challenge, there are some ground rules you’ll need to follow to make looking after Joy Behar go as smoothly as possible.  PREPARING YOUR HOME Before picking Joy Behar up outside The View, you’ll need to make sure your home is ready for her arrival. Remove furniture with sharp objects because her vision is limited at night, and replace cube organizers with a proper credenza, because otherwise she will attempt to crawl inside the cubes. Additionally, you’ll want to make her feel welcome by giving her a space of her own, but in order to truly be comfortable she’ll need to feel as though she’s the “alpha” of the house, so to speak. For this reason, it’s recommended she get the master bedroom. While you’re welcome to begin sleeping in a guest room, please note that Joy will feel most at home at the sight of you sleeping on the couch. GROOMING Be aware that Joy’s hair grows quicker than average, her nails slower than average. Hair maintenance requires one bowl cut per week, lest she begin to look “shaggy.” At the request of her View cohosts, it’s advised that Joy Behar bathe every other day—ideally supervised, or else she’ll run the water while she waits on the toilet. Contrary to what she may tell you, Joy is not allergic to “tubs.” It is not possible to be allergic to “tubs.” TEMPERAMENT Expect Joy to fluctuate between periods of mania followed by episodes of depression. Do your best to avoid sudden loud noises so as to not cause flashbacks to her time fighting in the Vietnam War. While Joy may hump blankets, couch corners, or any available male leg, she is to remain entirely celibate.  EXERCISE NEEDS Joy plays seniors volleyball every afternoon at the YMCA. Although she spends most of the game alternating between faking an ankle injury and cursing at the opposing team, it is crucial for her social development that she spends daily time among other members of the elderly community. DIET If Joy is happy, give her root vegetables. If she is upset, give her ham. VACCINATIONS Joy has been putting off her shingles vaccine since 2001 after hearing that one of her girlfriends had a bad reaction. Do your best to convince her that it’s time to get it. Joy is to receive Covid boosters in accordance with CDC guidelines, though it is advised you tell her they are instead “meningitis stuff,” lest you suffer through her rant about the lab leak theory.  SLEEP At minimum, Joy must sleep 17 hours per day, but no more than 19 hours. If she has a nightmare, let her sleep in your bed with you. (At your discretion, of course.) MEDICINES Let Joy take one birth control pill each morning; her pack is all placebo, she just prefers to feel as though she is of childbearing age. CRITICAL READING SKILLS Joy currently reads at a 7th grade level, but her goal is to hit 10th grade level before she dies. Recommended reading materials include The Great Gatsby, The Crucible, and Of Mice and Men. COMPATIBILITY  Joy does not get along with children, teenagers, men aged 18-35, women aged 18-60, women aged 62-100, pets, or robots. Follow the advice listed here and you should have no trouble adjusting to your new life with Joy Behar. It’s not always going to be easy, but we assure you it’ll be worth it. Best of luck!"
"Chill, Dude, Don’t Fuck This Up: This Kid’s Mom Let Him Sit In The Front Seat For The First Time And He Immediately Reclined His Seat Way Back And Started Messing With The AC",N/A,https://clickhole.com/chill-dude-dont-fuck-this-up-this-kids-mom-let-him-sit-in-the-front-seat-for-the-first-time-and-he-immediately-reclined-his-seat-way-back-and-started-messing-with-the-ac/,"When presented with an incredible opportunity, it can be hard to keep your chill, and this story out of Richmond, VA is about a kid whose overexcitement about his current situation might blow the whole thing up: This 7-year-old kid’s mom let him sit in the front seat for the first time and he immediately reclined his seat way back and started messing with the AC. Get a grip, dude! She’s not gonna let you back up here if you don’t cut this shit out! Even though she always said he wouldn’t be allowed to sit up front until he reached double digits, by the grace of God, Max’s mom decided Max could sit up front today on their drive home from the dentist. However, Max is dangerously close to wrecking this enviable state of affairs, because as soon as his mom started driving, he pointed all of the vents at himself, jacked the AC up to high, and turned the seat heater up to 88 degree before reclining so far he was basically just laying down. Although Max did manage to quickly put his seat back up before he got yelled at, he is continuing to test the limits by pressing every button on the car’s front console and rolling the window all the way down despite the fact that the AC is clearly blasting. Does this kid realize this is his one shot to prove he can handle sitting up front? Knock it off, Max! Max could have used the long red light his mom just hit to relax and enjoy his first ever ride in the front of the Camry, but instead he decided to pass the time by pulling his seat belt as far as it would go before letting it snap back against his chest. While this was definitely fun, when he tried to pull the seat belt out again, he realized it had somehow locked over him, leaving him basically trapped until the end of the ride. However, any hope that this would constrain Max was immediately lost, as he proceeded to start playing with the sun visor above his head. He yanked it down, causing the menu for his favorite pizza place to fall out, which led him to chant “Pizza! Pizza! I want pizza!” even though he knows it’s a weekday and his parents only ever get takeout on Saturdays.  Dude, the only reason your mom let you up here is because you were “so mature during your teeth cleaning.” Is this really how someone who’s so mature during their teeth cleaning acts?! Max’s mom had definitely just about had enough when Max started flipping through the XM radio stations with the volume all the way up, but he was able to buy himself some more time when he came across “SexyBack,” which is one of his mom’s favorite songs since it reminds her of the time in her life when she says she was fun. With his mom distracted by the music, Max proceeded to dig through the entire glove compartment and center console, both of which he’s perused thoroughly before while waiting for his mom to get back from filling a prescription at CVS. Is that really worth it, Max? It’s the same stuff in there as always! Don’t fuck this up for yourself because you want to look at a bunch of loose pens!!! From there, Max pulled out the car’s registration and started leafing through it, causing his mom to finally snap and threaten to make him sit in the backseat. While there’s no guarantee this means she’s never gonna let him sit up front again, it’s definitely not a good sign. Just sit in your seat with your hands crossed, Max, because you are walking on thin ice right now! Don’t think Mom won’t pull the car over and make you sit in the back—remember when she really did stop on the side of the road after you kept kicking the back of her seat on the way to the Outer Banks? You’re almost home, so just be normal for three more minutes, and you might get to sit up front again."
Finally! Mattel And The Gerald Ford Presidential Library Are Teaming Up To Release A Limited Edition Barbie Whose Job Is Feeding Gerald Ford Grapes In Heaven,N/A,https://clickhole.com/finally-mattel-and-the-gerald-ford-presidential-library-are-teaming-up-to-release-a-limited-edition-barbie-whose-job-is-feeding-gerald-ford-grapes-in-heaven/,"If you played with Barbie dolls as a kid, you’re going to love the latest news out of Mattel, who just revealed its coolest evolution of Barbie yet: Mattel and The Gerald Ford Presidential Library are teaming up to release a limited edition Barbie whose job is feeding Gerald Ford grapes in Heaven. So amazing. We wish we had a Barbie like this growing up! Marking the toy giants’ first collaboration with University of Michigan’s Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library, Mattel’s latest press release unveiled plans for a Barbie who works as a servant for Gerald Ford in the afterlife, where she spends all eternity feeding the former POTUS grapes from a gold platter as he basks in luxury on a throne of fine silk pillows (and occasionally Barbie’s lap). According to the announcement, Barbie has been hand-feeding President Ford grapes since the moment he passed away in 2006, and because it’s impossible to feel full when you’re in Heaven, Barbie never, ever stops feeding him grapes, and she never will, which is why President Ford makes sure to say “More” after every single grape she puts in his mouth!  Finally, every girl in America can have the perfect Barbie to pair with their Gerald Ford dolls. This hard-working, first-of-its-kind Barbie won’t just be fun to play with, but it’s also set to make millions of little girls interested in learning more about Gerald Ford and how they can serve him in the afterlife too.  “Not only has this special edition Barbie lived a pious life which was deemed worthy of Heaven in the eyes of God after she died suddenly of bacterial sepsis at the age of 24, but she’s also been assigned to one of the most privileged jobs in all of God’s Kingdom: personal grape-feeder to one-term president Gerald Ford,” explained Mattel in their public memo, noting that this Barbie’s accessories include a halo, a revealingly thin robe, a grape platter, and massive, oiled up breasts for President Ford’s soul to leer at as he laps up the rewards of eternal paradise.  “Barbie sometimes wishes she had a different job in Heaven, since President Ford’s insatiable appetite is very tiring to accommodate. But even when she asks President Ford’s soul for a break and he mutters, “No,” Barbie persists anyway, like the hard-working woman she is! Thankfully, Barbie’s found friends in her coworkers, Kayla and Desiree, who, respectively, belly dance for President Ford and fan him with palm fronds. After a long eon of pampering President Ford, Barbie and her work friends bond by silently glancing at each other as they continue spoiling him. With new friends by her side, Barbie will prove to girls everywhere that sky’s the limit when it comes to the appetite of a president’s soul.” Wow. Mattel has really hit it out of the park with this Barbie! Without a doubt, this Barbie is going to make waves as soon as it hits store shelves. If there’s a toy that’s cooler and honors President Ford more than this, we haven’t heard of it! Way to go, Mattel!"
Did Sesame Street Go Too Far When They Showed Mr. Snuffleupagus Being Flattened In A Garbage Truck To Teach Kids About The Dangers Of Technology?,N/A,https://clickhole.com/did-sesame-street-go-too-far-when-they-showed-mr-snuffleupagus-being-flattened-in-a-garbage-truck-to-teach-kids-about-the-dangers-of-technology/,"As a staple of educational programming for kids for decades, Sesame Street has never shied away from addressing difficult topics, but a recent episode has parents saying they’ve crossed a line: Did Sesame Street go too far when they showed Mr. Snuffleupagus being flattened in a garbage truck to teach kids about the dangers of technology? Yikes. Wasn’t there a way of teaching this lesson without showing that in graphic detail?  The controversial scene, which has inspired hundreds of angry comments on the Sesame Street Facebook page and even a petition to cancel the show entirely, begins with Elmo wandering down Sesame Street while flying his new drone. Alan the shopkeeper overhears Elmo say, “This thing is so neat! Technology is the greatest thing in the world!” and he responds, “Now Elmo, technology can be neat, but we have to be careful with it, too.” They are then startled by the sound of Mr. Snuffleupagus screaming for help and turn to see him being crushed in the back of a garbage truck. From there, the scene proceeds to show Mr. Snuffleupagus’ gruesome demise from three different camera angles while his gigantic body is flattened like a pancake by the garbage truck and all of his organs, blood, and skeleton are slowly forced out of his trunk hole. Elmo then runs yelling to alert the garbage men that they are crushing Snuffy, but it’s too late. They rush to reverse the trash compactor, screaming in horror when they discover that nothing is left of Snuffy besides his blood-soaked, flattened pelt. Then, the entire Sesame Street gang wanders outside to check out all the commotion and take pictures of Snuffy’s broken remains, while Bert and Ernie start singing, “Technology can help us, but it can hurt us too. // Just look at Snuffleupagus, and you’ll see what it can do.” In a statement, Sesame Street defended its decision to air the scene, saying, “For over 50 years, Sesame Street has been a trusted source that millions of families count on to teach their children important life lessons. While watching Mr. Snuffleupagus’ brains being forced out of his eye sockets like that may have been uncomfortable for some children, the threats humanity faces from industrialization, AI, and other technological dangers are even more uncomfortable, and children deserve to be educated about them.” Wow! Sounds like Sesame Street is really digging in their heels on this one. What do you think? Will this all blow over in a few days, or could this be a turning point for Sesame Street as a cultural fixture? Let us know in the comments!"
Clearly The Alpha Of His Nursing Home: This Old Guy Has Full-On Basketballs On His Walker,N/A,https://clickhole.com/clearly-the-alpha-of-his-nursing-home-this-old-guy-has-full-on-basketballs-on-his-walker/,"Some people can tell you exactly who they are without saying a word, and one senior citizen has left no doubt in our minds that he’s top dog at his retirement community: This old guy has full-on basketballs on his walker. That’s the walker of an alpha male, no two ways about it. One look at the fat orange basketballs gracing the bottom of this stooped-over grandpa’s walker tells you everything you need to know about the pecking order at The Meadowlark Springs Nursing Home & Care Center. Unlike the demure hush of the itty-bitty tennis balls adorning the feet of his peers’ walkers, his basketballs make a resonant, unapologetic thunk with each shuffling step, a thunk that says, “This is my fucking nursing home, and the rest of you chumps are all just assisted living in it.” Sure, those big unwieldy balls must run over people’s toes all the time, but this geriatric king probably can’t remember the last time he had to make way for a player with more game than him, and that’s not just the dementia talking. Old age has gotta be pretty sweet when you’re living basketballs-on-the-walker large like he is. You just know this guy’s pulling widow pussy like nobody’s business—one look at those Spaldings and the Depends are dropping. The cafeteria’s green bean casserole always gets cooked just the way the big man likes it, mushy as hell and heavy on the salt, and if some upjumped little loser makes a stink about that setting off his hypertension, he’ll be scurrying off as fast as his fuzzy green tennis balls can carry him when he hears numero uno dribbling over to have words. And if bossman says he wants to watch Fred Astaire and Rita Hayworth cutting it up in 1942’s “You Were Never Lovelier,” you better fucking believe the next movie night’s gonna be “You Were Never Lovelier,” with Big Mister Basketballs parked right up front exuding the steely eyed dominance of a silverback gorilla. Dude probably only needs the extra stability of a walker to support the massive cock he’s packing. We can only imagine how bad Meadowlark Springs’ resident betas must envy the virile authority that seems to come so naturally to this octogenarian pimp, but they have to know deep down that the hierarchy isn’t changing until this guy gets his fill of life and decides to hobble basketballs-first into the next world. Until then, he wants a hit off their oxygen tank? He’s grabbing that nasal cannula without asking. He wants someone else’s medication? He’s slamming that little cup back and taking their water to wash it down. He gets tired of waiting around for somebody’s esophageal cancer to come back so he can put the moves on their missus? Brother, he’s down in the activity room with her shimmying those basketballs around to “The Way You Look Tonight” in a half-tempo foxtrot so smooth she feels like she’s 55 again. Damn, those basketballs really say it all. Here’s hoping that when we’re old, we have aftermarket walker accessories with even half the swag of this mobility-assisted king. "
A Beautiful Sacrifice: This Conservationist Is Attempting To Save Monarch Butterflies From Parasitic Wasps By Offering His Son As Tribute For The Wasps To Lay Their Eggs In,N/A,https://clickhole.com/a-beautiful-sacrifice-this-conservationist-is-attempting-to-save-monarch-butterflies-from-parasitic-wasps-by-offering-his-son-as-tribute-for-the-wasps-to-lay-their-eggs-in/,"Talk is cheap when it comes to supporting environmental causes, but one selfless nature lover is putting his money where his mouth is in the fight to protect a beloved species: This conservationist is attempting to save monarch butterflies from parasitic wasps by offering his son as tribute for the wasps to lay their eggs in. Wow. It takes a noble soul to protect these butterflies by giving up that which is truly dearest to him. The parasitic wasp species Pteromalus cassotis is a notorious scourge of monarch butterflies, steadily thinning the vital pollinators’ numbers by laying hundreds of eggs in any monarch chrysalises they can find, but conservationist David Paolillo has refused to turn a blind eye to the butterflies’ suffering. Instead, he’s set out to spare the monarchs from this wretched fate by presenting the wasps an even finer sacrifice to bear the agony of being parasitized in the monarchs’ place, offering up his 10-year-old son Michael to serve as an alternate host for the wasps’ larvae to infest. Even as tears stream down the conservationist’s own face, he’s dutifully pressing on to wrap his son in an ersatz chrysalis of bright green fabric and affix the bundle to a pine sapling in their backyard, symbolically evoking the likeness of a monarch pupa to make the nature of his bargain clear and unmistakable to the wasps. “O great and fearsome P. cassotis, I beg you, spare the monarch butterfly from the woes of your parasitism, and rather lay your eggs in this son of mine instead!” said David in an impassioned appeal to the wasps, throwing his arms wide as he yelled into the woods behind his house. “I offer you life for life, the future of my own bloodline for the future of these fair, fluttering creatures! See what a splendid feast the boy will make for your devouring young, far richer than the monarchs’ meager pupae—come, deposit your eggs in his flesh and let our pact be sealed!”  It’s truly admirable how David’s iron conviction to preserve a healthy, robust monarch population has remained steadfast, even as his son begs him, “Please Papa, please don’t let the wasps lay eggs in me! I’ll help pollinate even more plants than the monarchs do, I promise! Please unwrap the chrysalis, I can hear the wasps coming PAPA I CAN HEAR THE WASPS!” Even renowned conservationists like Goodall and Attenborough would be humbled by this man’s unhesitating altruism. Having studied biology for decades, David likely harbors no illusions that having wasp eggs laid in him will be anything but a long, excruciating process for young Michael, but so selfless is his devotion to monarch butterflies that giving up a child more precious to him than anything in this world is a price worth paying to protect these iconic lepidoptera. After all, knowing that the monarch’s migratory subspecies has already been assessed as “Endangered” by the IUCN Red List, how could offering the wasps any less than his own offspring ever possibly suffice? As the buzz of arriving wasps grows deafening and drowns out the boy’s harrowing pleas, David must no doubt take comfort in the fact that the last glimpses of green fabric disappearing beneath the teeming swarm means that he’s just notched a major victory for conservationists everywhere. It’s great to see someone really going out of their way to help preserve biodiversity like this. The next time you spot a monarch butterfly outside, stop and spare a quick thought for the man who was willing to give everything to keep them from harm! "
"Well, Well, Well, Look At Mr. Fancy Man Over Here: This Man Is Cleaning His House",N/A,https://clickhole.com/well-well-well-look-at-mr-fancy-man-over-here-this-man-is-cleaning-his-house/,"Wowwwww, would you take a look at this? We’ve just come across a special little guy with a highly refined lifestyle who is very clearly better he is than the rest of us: Mr. Fancy Man over here is cleaning his house. Well, well, well…looks like we’ve found ourselves a real Martha Stewart! Mr. Fancy Man, aka Adrian Booker of Northampton, Connecticut, got up at 8:30 this morning and immediately set to work transforming his apartment from a perfectly serviceable dump into a palace fit for King Charles of England himself. Adrian put in his AirPods, cranked some Beach House, and mopped his floor with a Swiffer, not even stopping for a second to think that maybe the film of grime on his kitchen linoleum was’t hurting anybody and could probably be left alone for another week or so. The 27-year-old film colorist then pranced on over to the bathroom, where he sprayed the toilet down with Lysol (linen scented no less!) and emptied the wastepaper basket even though it was only, like, three quarters of the way full. Yep, guess while the rest of us slobs were laying on the couch hungover and eating cold pizza crusts with the shades drawn, Adrian decided he was going to spend the day dusting like some magical Mary Poppins. He even sprayed a few squirts of Windex on his bathroom mirror and used newspaper to wipe it so it wouldn’t streak instead of just waiting for the shower to steam it up and wiping it with a towel. Looks like he’s too good to have little pieces of towel fuzz all over his mirror like the rest of us! Nothing but the best for our Fancy Little Guy! The most remarkable thing about Prince Fancy’s impromptu tidying and sanitizing session is that he doesn’t even have a date tonight or a visit from his parents coming up or any other actual reason for cleaning his house. Nope, apparently he is just a man of sophisticated tastes who just couldn’t STAND having a few dirty plates on the floor next to his bed or a football-sized wad of cat hair stuck to his carpet like us average Joes. This special man knows what he likes, and he likes it FANCY.  Look at Mr. Fancy Man go! It’s now 9:26 am and Adrian is showing no sign of slowing down. In fact, he’s actually straightening out the pillows on his bed a little and picking the cat hairs off of them by hand. What comes next for this king of fanciness? A nice soak in the tub while sipping on tea and eating caviar? A manicure before heading to the opera? Whatever it is, let’s all take a moment to put on our white gloves and give Mr. Fancy Man a gentle round of applause. He deserves it. "
Going Off: Candy Crush Has Announced That There’s No Shame In Being Addicted To Candy Crush Because Playing Their Game For Hours Is Way Healthier Than How Everyone Else Spends Time On Their Phone,N/A,https://clickhole.com/going-off-candy-crush-has-announced-that-theres-no-shame-in-being-addicted-to-candy-crush-because-playing-their-game-for-hours-is-way-healthier-than-how-everyone-else-spends-time-on-their-ph/,"Candy Crush is an incredibly popular game with over 200 million monthly users, so there’s a good chance you know someone who spends more time than they’d like to admit playing the app. However, it looks like app’s creators have something positive to say to anyone who’s addicted to the game: Candy Crush has announced that there’s no shame in being addicted to Candy Crush because playing their game for hours is way healthier than how everyone else spends time on their phone. Damn. Looks like Candy Crush is definitely going off here. Earlier this week, the gaming studio behind Candy Crush announced in a press release that nobody should feel bad about playing Candy Crush all day long because everyone else is just mindlessly staring at social media all day instead. Citing the statistic that the average person spends around five hours per day on their phone, Candy Crush defended their product, arguing that “playing a super fun game is a significantly better use of your time than doomscrolling through a Twitter feed full of tweets from people you hate but can’t bring yourself to unfollow.” “Look, everyone stares at their phone for hours and hours a day, but only some people are spending those hours working towards a goal, building new skills, and challenging themselves to eliminate candies from the board,” explained Candy Crush in their statement. “What’s really healthier here? Stalking your former classmates on Instagram, watching TikToks where teenagers incorrectly diagnose each other’s mental illnesses, or getting to the next level of Candy Crush as you beam with a sense of achievement? Face the facts: if you’re going to while away your entire day with your face in your phone, Candy Crush is literally the healthiest way to do it.” “If you ask most people to look at their screen time and explain what they did for all those hours, they’ll come up empty,” continued Candy Crush. “Were they hate-reading a personal essay about imposter syndrome from some random writer all of Twitter is dunking on today? Were they developing an eating disorder while looking at photoshopped bikini pics from influencers? They can’t even remember—it’s dead time for them, significant hours lost each and every day from their precious, limited time on Earth. But ask a Candy Crush addict, and they’ll proudly tell you about all the levels they cleared, as well as the levels they’re still working toward. If that’s not healthy, tell us what is.” Wow. Candy Crush clearly isn’t playing around here. “Besides, everyone knows by now that spending tons of time on social media leads to anxiety and depression, as the rates of both have skyrocketed in recent years. But you know the only thing playing Candy Crush leads to? A higher Candy Crush score!” continued the statement. “Honestly, people should be grateful for their Candy Crush addiction, because for many of our users, it’s probably the only reason they haven’t gotten indoctrinated by alt-right propaganda on Facebook.” “Also, we just want to add that when it comes to addictions, this one isn’t even close to being the worst. No one’s dying of a Candy Crush overdose,” added Candy Crush. “Yeah, maybe a few work deadlines get missed. Yeah, maybe a family has to eat cereal for dinner instead of a home-cooked meal. And yeah, maybe a couple grand that should’ve gone to paying back medical debt goes to Candy Crush in-app purchases instead. But is any of that really so bad? It’s not opioids…” “Listen, at the end of the day, we’re all helpless against our phones,” concluded Candy Crush. “So if you’re going to be on your device anyway, wouldn’t you want to spend it in a productive way, like Candy Crush? You only get one life. Spend it playing Candy Crush.” Damn. Do you think Candy Crush made a good case for themselves? Sound off below on whether or not this made you want to start playing Candy Crush instead of entering a hate-spiral after looking at another one of your ex’s Instagram stories!"
Shameless Self-Promotion: John Lithgow Keeps Yelling His Own Name Into The Throat Of The Dying Guy He’s Doing Mouth-To-Mouth On,N/A,https://clickhole.com/shameless-self-promotion-john-lithgow-keeps-yelling-his-own-name-into-the-throat-of-the-dying-guy-hes-doing-mouth-to-mouth-on/,"It’s a simple truth of show business that actors have to tirelessly put themselves out there to make a living, but one performer’s tactless attempt to raise his own profile off another person’s tragedy may have just crossed a line: John Lithgow keeps yelling his own name into the throat of the dying guy he’s doing mouth-to-mouth on. C’mon man, there’s a time and place for this stuff. Just minutes ago, the pleasant afternoon at this public park turned to panic when an older gentleman suddenly clutched his chest, gave a brief cry, and slumped to the ground motionless. A crowd of concerned bystanders quickly gathered around him and called 911, though none possessed the medical know-how to render assistance themselves, and the dispatcher’s estimated arrival time was all but certain to fall outside the critical window to save the man’s life. It was only when things seemed truly hopeless that a tall, white-haired stranger calmly moved through the crowd and knelt down to make sure the unconscious man’s airways were clear, and under slightly different circumstances this would have been an unambiguously uplifting thing. But sadly, this narcissistic jackass had to go and make things weird by repeatedly shouting his own name, John Lithgow, into the dying guy’s throat while administering mouth-to-mouth resuscitation on him. In fairness to Lithgow, his form is otherwise immaculate, and the loudness with which he’s yelling “JOHN LITHGOW” leaves no doubt that he’s forcing great quantities of much-needed air into the other man’s lungs. The diaphragm control he’s honed over decades performing on stage and screen probably makes him uniquely suited for giving mouth-to-mouth, though it’s definitely a double-edged sword if that dramatic background is also to blame for whatever egomania compels him to keep bellowing “JOHN LITHGOW” over and over like some kind of deranged Pokémon. As slimy as his flagrant showboating feels, we can’t help but be a little impressed that he’s able to enunciate “JOHN LITHGOW” so clearly despite having formed a perfect seal with the other guy’s mouth. A lesser actor could probably only manage a muffled “JORM LIMFGOWNG” under those conditions, though again, it’s hard to imagine anyone else choosing to yell the name “JOHN LITHGOW” in the first place instead of just following normal first aid protocol. This is a man’s life, John, not some fucking Gilbert and Sullivan bullshit. Have a little respect! A big part of what makes this all feel so sweaty and desperate is the fact that the internet reliably goes nuts when a celebrity helps out a random stranger like this, and at least three bystanders are recording him on their phones. If Lithgow could just trust the process and not shout his own name down this guy’s throat like a maniac, someone would still inevitably go “Hey, that’s John Lithgow!” and we’d be writing the “Wow, John Lithgow Just Saved A Man’s Life” article he’s so transparently fishing for. But Lithgow’s self-absorption means that this act of genuine heroism will forever have a big asterisk on it, and instead of just singing his praises for potentially saving a man’s life, we’ve got to tell you that he’s throwing in some chest compressions now and keeping a flawless 100 bpm pace by rhythmically shouting “JOHN-LITH-GOW-OF-3RD-ROCK-FROM-THE-SUN-FAME” while he does it. Boy, some people just always need to be the center of attention. Here’s hoping the dying guy pulls through, because spending your final moments as a prop in John Lithgow’s unseemly publicity stunt sounds like a terrible way to go!"
Evolutionary Disaster: A Busy IHOP Has Set Off This Man’s Fight or Flight,N/A,https://clickhole.com/evolutionary-disaster-a-busy-ihop-has-set-off-this-mans-fight-or-flight/,"Millions of years of evolution have transformed human beings from early apelike bipeds to the highly intelligent creatures we are today, but unfortunately, all that time has not been enough for some of us to adapt to modern life. The man in this tragic story is an example of one such evolutionary failure: A busy IHOP has set off his fight or flight. Oof. Looks like natural selection needs to take a second pass at this loser. Luke Berkowicz of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania may seem like a perfectly advanced human specimen—he has a masters degree in programming, a full-time job, and a healthy social life—but then again, he’s currently having a full-on short-circuit meltdown because the pancake chain where he’s having breakfast with a few buddies after their rec kickball practice is getting slightly overcrowded. Luke’s neurochemistry began to go haywire soon as he entered the restaurant, where a small crowd near the host stand left him with little personal space while waiting to be seated, forcing him to awkwardly cram near the door as more parties filed in, making him feel as if there was nowhere he could stand without being in the way.  Then, upon being seated, he was immediately overwhelmed by the huge plastic menu, which had far too many options and also had a little sticky spot of dried syrup on it. That, compounded by the incessant racket of kids bickering at the next table, triggered a surge of adrenaline through his body, causing his pores to sweat and his pupils to dilate as he tried in vain to decide whether it made more sense to get a pancake combo versus a simple stack of pancakes with an à la carte side. Then, when the waitress arrived before he was ready to give his order, Luke’s body reacted to the intrusion the way most people’s systems would respond to a traumatic car accident or military combat: blood began pumping to his limbs and away from his brain, readying him to make a lifesaving escape from the restaurant when a simple “I need another minute” would probably have sufficed. Feeling rushed, he went ahead and ordered something completely different than what he’d originally been considering, a decision he regretted as soon as the server left the table. As more patrons have entered the IHOP, Luke’s amygdala has continued to flare with dire warning signals, as if his body somehow expects all the families enjoying pancakes to descend on him in some sort of mob and tear him limb from limb. Unfortunately, the parking lot outside has only grown fuller as time has gone on, and it’s at this point a near certainty that Luke will suffer a panic attack trying to back out of his spot and make a left turn onto the moderately busy two-lane street beyond, feeling all the while as though he is a primitive human fleeing a lion on the savannah. He is simply too flooded with fight-or-flight neurochemicals to function normally now, and will likely have to take the rest of the day off to recover from the assault on the senses he experienced while eating a relaxed 10 a.m. breakfast with friends. Wow. What a true disaster of human evolution. It seems that some people just aren’t biologically calibrated to survive in the modern world. Let’s just hope that Luke never has any kids, as passing on his genes would only hinder evolutionary progress for the human race. "
A Piece Of History: The Only Thimbleful Of Pixie Dust That Remained When The Last Little Girl Stopped Believing In JFK Is Coming To The Smithsonian,N/A,https://clickhole.com/a-piece-of-history-the-only-thimbleful-of-pixie-dust-that-remained-when-the-last-little-girl-stopped-believing-in-jfk-is-coming-to-the-smithsonian/,"The impact of President John F. Kennedy’s death is still felt to this day, and it remains a subject of intense speculation and scrutiny even six decades later. Now, an important artifact from that fateful day in 1963 is being put on display for public viewing: The only thimbleful of pixie dust that remained when the last little girl stopped believing in JFK is coming to the Smithsonian.  Incredible. If you love American history, you’ll definitely want to see this exhibit! Right in time for the 60th anniversary of JFK’s death this upcoming November, Smithsonian visitors will have the opportunity to see the small volume of pixie dust that was preserved when JFK slowly faded away in a swirling mist of sparkles just as the last little girl in the world who believed in him ceased believing. Museum visitors can relive the President’s final moments through a timeline of placards placed around the exhibit, from that sunny Dallas morning when JFK told his personal physician he’d felt himself “growing weaker and weaker…it seems the children no longer believe,” to the tragic moment Jackie saw her husband beginning to vanish in the Lincoln convertible’s backseat, when she and a Secret Service agent took each other’s hands, shut their eyes, and tried to believe in JFK again with all their might to prevent him from disappearing. Early on in Kennedy’s term, it was said that small, delightful miracles followed his motorcade wherever it traveled: whenever lost toys were found, whenever broken clocks suddenly began tick-tocking again, whenever a baby laughed for the first time, whenever a cloud was shaped liked the face of someone you love, it was a sure sign that President Kennedy was near. But over his time in office, as fewer and fewer children believed in him, talk of those miracles began to fade, until it disappeared altogether. The new Smithsonian exhibit will let visitors experience the most magical moments of JFK’s presidency, along with the not-so-magical aspects, with features including the declassified CIA dossier on 9-year-old Isabella Martin, the girl who investigators found to be the very last kid to believe in JFK before she eventually grew too old and lost her childlike wonder. Wow! Without a doubt, this is going to be the must-see exhibit of the year. What a powerful way to commemorate one of the darkest moments in American history!"
"‘Enough With Blood, We Want Skin!’: The American Red Cross Has Announced That While They Loved Collecting Your Blood, They Are More Interested In Skin Now",N/A,https://clickhole.com/enough-with-blood-we-want-skin-the-american-red-cross-has-announced-that-while-they-loved-collecting-your-blood-they-are-more-interested-in-skin-now/,"The Red Cross has long been the backbone of the American blood donation system, but it seems like the organization is ready to make a major change regarding which bodily substance they collect: The American Red Cross has announced that while they loved collecting your blood, they are more interested in skin now. Wow. This is definitely a new leaf for the Red Cross! Earlier this morning, a press release from the organization revealed that after 140 years of service, The Red Cross is putting blood collection behind them and moving onto skin. The organization clarified that they have thoroughly enjoyed drawing the nation’s blood, but they’re in a “skin phase now,” so they “just want skin.” “Since our founding in 1881, it’s been our mission to collect and distribute blood, and don’t get us wrong, we loved every minute of it,” said the Red Cross in their statement. “We will never forget the good times we had putting a tube in your arm and pulling blood out through the tube. But enough with blood!!!! We want skin!!!!!!!” The Red Cross advised prospective donors to “just show up and hand over your skin,” adding, “You had no problem giving us your blood. Now give us your skin.” The statement further explained that they will just “collect a flap of skin or two,” adding that anyone who donates their skin will receive a coupon for a free month of Hulu. Along with the announcement, the Red Cross debuted the promotional materials of their new campaign:  The organization further clarified that while they still won’t accept any donations from gay people, anyone else is welcome to come give some skin. Damn. Although this is definitely a new frontier for the Red Cross, it seems like they’re pretty confident in what they’re doing. Visit your local Red Cross donation center ASAP if you’re interested in donating your skin!"
"Modern Day Caesar: This Man Just Ordered A Single Coffee DoorDashed To Him, Which Is Like, $13 After Taxes, Fees, And Tip",N/A,https://clickhole.com/modern-day-caesar-this-man-just-ordered-a-single-coffee-doordashed-to-him-which-is-like-13-after-taxes-fees-and-tip/,"Some people will spare no expense to enjoy the finer things in life. For an example, look no further than this resident of Cobble Hill in Brooklyn, who just ordered a single coffee delivered to him through DoorDash, which is like, $13 after taxes, fees, and tip.  Such grandeur! It simply doesn’t get more opulent than paying a small fortune to have a coffee charioted to you from five blocks away by an undocumented DoorDash worker on a moped! Not since Caesar has someone pampered themselves with such indulgent luxury as 33-year-old UX designer Ryan Bellmore, who just ordered a black, medium-sized coffee delivered to him at three times the price he would’ve paid had he just walked to a coffee shop himself. Today, this bon vivant has thrown all modesty to the wind to bask in opulence, shelling out outrageous premiums so that he wouldn’t have to brew the coffee grinds he has in his kitchen, or even so much as cross the threshold of his apartment—oh yes, Ryan has indeed instructed the delivery driver to brave his building’s five floor walk up and hand his Americano to him at his very own door, as every sensualist needs a cup-bearing servant! Countless resources have been put to work in the service of Ryan’s lavish expenditure: from the plastic bag, paper bag, and saran wrap enveloping his coffee to the gas used by the delivery driver’s scooter—all for Ryan’s all-important convenience! To someone who lives as well as Ryan, it barely even registers that he’s spent any money at all: a wave of his finger and a few taps on his phone were all that was required to mobilize a series of laborers to prepare and deliver him a special treat, which he will drink 70% of before setting it on one of his many side tables and forgetting about it. In combination with the $3,750 he pays in rent for a studio apartment, as well as the $35 he’ll spend on DoorDash again for dinner later tonight, this $13 coffee makes it clear that sumptuous living is the only life for Ryan. If he’s willing to pay this much to have a single beverage hand-delivered to him, his excess appears to be without limit. Paying to add $4 worth of avocado to a $14 breakfast sandwich, taking an Uber to a dine-in movie theater that’s right off the subway, where he’ll drop $18 plus tip on one cocktail…there is no end to the luxuries Ryan’s appetite may soon desire! Drink long and drink deep of your coffee, Ryan, for it has come at a price fit for a king! Here’s to living high and magnificently!"
Teaching Grit FTW! KFC Is Introducing A New Dinner Bucket With Nothing But A Hatchet And Single Live Hen For Sensitive Boys Who Need To Learn What It Takes To Be A Man,N/A,https://clickhole.com/teaching-grit-ftw-kfc-is-introducing-a-new-dinner-bucket-with-nothing-but-a-hatchet-and-single-live-hen-for-sensitive-boys-who-need-to-learn-what-it-takes-to-be-a-man/,"This world is a harsh and unforgiving place, but thankfully one major restaurant chain is stepping up to teach our sons the toughness they’ll need to survive it: KFC is introducing a new dinner bucket with nothing but a hatchet and a single live hen for sensitive boys who need to learn what it takes to be a man. What a great idea! That should help them grow a little backbone. Plenty of meek, gentle-hearted boys are happy to eat fried chicken if the ugly business of taking another creature’s life is out of sight, out of mind, but fast food giant Kentucky Fried Chicken is refusing to coddle them any longer. Instead, they’ve rolled out a new ‘Road To Manhood’ dinner bucket containing only a sharp hatchet and a very much alive hen, in hopes that the ordeal of their first kill will blood the little softies into the ranks of true maturity. KFC understands that hunger is a powerful teacher, and they know that while the heft of the hatchet may feel strange and unnatural in the sensitive young lad’s hands at first, his trembling timidity will inevitably give way to a man’s resolve if it’s the only way to make the gnawing pain in his belly subside. A delicate boy’s experience of the ‘Road To Manhood’ bucket will generally go like this: First, upon seeing the live chicken, he’ll immediately hug it and give it a cute little name like Beaky, or, if the boy is particularly sensitive, Lady Henrietta. Only after several minutes of watching his family chow down on their own fully cooked meals will he become suddenly aware of his growing hunger, and with it, the gleaming hatchet still resting handle-up in the dinner bucket. From here, the boy may either attempt to beg his way out of the situation or offer the hen a tearful little apology, but soon enough he’ll dry his eyes and make peace with the task before him. Because KFC has wisely made the hatchet just a little too light to let gravity do all the work alone, he’ll find that his first hesitating, non-committal cuts will only maim the chicken, forcing him to summon a man’s strength and perform a decisive killing blow to end the terrified animal’s spasming struggle for its life—that is, give or take a few more distressing minutes of the decapitated chicken flopping around blindly while geysers of blood spurt out from its neck stump. Dinner and an important life lesson? KFC’s offering a pretty awesome deal here! “It’s time for the little wuss in your family to sack up and put a bit of hair on his chest, and our ‘Road To Manhood’ dinner bucket is here to show him that sometimes a man can’t fill his belly until he’s filled his ears with the panicked shrieks of a dying animal,” said KFC in a press release announcing the new menu item, explaining that gagging on the nauseating metallic stench of the bird’s fresh blood will only make the boy’s first dinner as a man taste that much sweeter. “We offer a few suggestion nicknames like Cluckerella or Attila the Hen to help get your son started with the pivotal rite of passage of killing a beloved pet for food, but from there it falls entirely on him to carefully yank out handfuls of the bird’s hot, slimy guts and painstakingly rip out the feathers that just moments ago he was affectionately patting. He may not enjoy the long, gruesome process of dismantling his companion into cutlets and drumsticks, but we know you’ll love the results of your sensitive boy finally becoming a man!” Wow, this dinner bucket takes customer service to a whole new level. Kudos to KFC for stepping up to help sensitive boys harden their hearts to the grim responsibilities expected of them in life!"

Dad’s been in a pretty sour mood since the Eagles lost the Super Bowl, so this new development couldn’t have come at a worse time for the old man: Barack Obama just showed up at the house asking to use his hall pass on Mom.

A couple hours ago, former President Barack Obama showed up to our doorstep holding a piece of wide-ruled paper that was clearly torn from a notebook which he said was his notarized sexual “hall pass” card, certifying that his wife Michelle has given him her full blessing to have extramarital sex with one woman of his choosing. Lucky for Mom, Barack chose Mom, but unlucky for Dad, Barack chose Mom. Barack Obama explained that he knew he wanted to use his hall pass on Mom ever since he saw a photo of her in her parish’s church directory back in 2011, but because he was busy at work—which he said with a wink that definitely made Dad straight up want to kill himself—he only just now found himself with a free afternoon during which he could make love to Mom. Wow! Well, that sure is something! Although it definitely hurt Dad’s feelings that Mom immediately agreed to Barack’s offer without consulting Dad, he seemed determined not to let it show because he was just like, “Okay, cool, I’ll just be in the garage,” to which Barack responded, “I’ll just be in your wife,” which was pretty gross but Mom laughed this really high-pitched laugh at it while holding Barack’s arm, which was also gross but seemed to show she was really into the whole thing. As Barack and Mom headed upstairs, Dad watched as Barack showed Mom some items in the reusable Target tote bag he brought with him, including a box of condoms, a bottle of KY Jelly, and some candy Peeps that apparently “caught [his] eye near the register.” Dad then stormed off to the garage, but unfortunately the garage is right under the master bedroom, so it basically became a pressure chamber full of the sounds of the 44th president having his way with Mom. Although Dad revved up as many power tools as he could to try to drown out the sounds of Barack Obama yelling “This is pretty slick for a menopausal woman!” and Mom shrieking like a goddamn banshee, eventually, Dad just grabbed a sixer of Coors and brought it to a stump in the backyard, where he proceeded to sit until he downed every last beer. Yikes. This is pretty brutal for Dad, especially when you consider the fact that this isn’t even Mom’s hall pass. For Dad’s sake, let’s hope that Mom never runs into Greg Kinnear. To make matters even worse, Mom and Dad were supposed to go on a date to the Melting Pot tonight. However, when time came to leave the house, Barack showed up in the kitchen wearing only a pair of Dad’s boxer shorts, started drinking straight out of a pickle jar in the fridge, and said “Need to get my electrolytes up. Your wife’s a racehorse, ooo-weee!” before heading back upstairs, adding, “Looks like you’re on your own tonight, bub.” As if Dad wasn’t already having the worst moment of his life while eating fondue alone while a former president slept with his wife, Dad then received a text from an unknown number (which turned out to be Obama) containing a video of Barack titty-fucking Mom—the very sex act that Dad has always wanted to do with Mom but assumed her breasts were too small to even attempt. “The damn guy made it work,” Dad said as he hung his head in shame. “Barack Hussein Obama figured out how to make it work.” Yikes. Our hearts seriously have to go out to Dad here. Nobody knows more than we do what a handful Dad can be, but seeing him take L after L today was pretty rough. Here’s hoping Barack Obama and Mom’s fuckfest ends sometime soon, because it’s pretty gut wrenching to see Dad go through this."
Mom’s Not Going To Like This: Dad Milked Himself Dry In The Bathroom At Work And Now He Doesn’t Have Any Cum Left For Intercourse,N/A,https://clickhole.com/moms-not-going-to-like-this-dad-milked-himself-dry-in-the-bathroom-at-work-and-now-he-doesnt-have-any-cum-left-for-intercourse/,"Get ready for an unbearably awkward night at home, because Dad’s gone and done something that’s guaranteed to make Mom absolutely furious: Dad milked himself dry in the bathroom at work and now doesn’t have any cum left for intercourse.  Yikes…Dad should know better. Last time he did this, Mom punched multiple holes in the wall! When Dad came home from the office all sweaty and red-faced with a grave look in his eyes, we all knew that he’d spent some special alone time in a bathroom stall at work today, but the reality was even worse than just that. Though he’s well aware that Mom flies off the handle if he doesn’t have any cum left for sex with her by the end of the day, Dad still went ahead and—if it’s anything like the last time he did this—started edging from the moment clocked in and then used his lunch break to straight-up abuse his cock until he reached an utterly explosive orgasm in the office bathroom, depleting virtually all of his cum reserves that he KNOWS he’s supposed to save for sex with Mom. Now, since Mom isn’t going to get her nightly 5 minutes of missionary and her husband’s semen, it’s all but guaranteed that she’s putting Dad in the dog house.  Dad’s not a subtle person, so you can bet that Mom’s going to smell the shame on him the moment she comes downstairs and sees him standing all cumless in his Dockers. Unless he figures out a way to magically conjure up more seminal fluids to deliver on Mom’s daily dose, Dad’s going to be sleeping on the couch for a week or more. There’s zero chance Mom’s letting him in their bed after he busted into an office toilet so hard that it put his libido out of business for the night. Knowing Dad, he probably blew every last drop of his nut in one shot only because he saw a coworker’s bra strap or something, and he just couldn’t contain himself. Honestly, we’re pissed for Mom too! What a waste of Dad’s semen. This is a basic martial duty, Dad, c’mon. Yikes. It’s going to be so, so awkward to watch Dad be extra nice to Mom to compensate for not having any cum for her.  Judging by how livid Mom’s gotten the other times Dad’s come home from work with not a teaspoon of semen left for her, he’s going to be bringing her flowers and new jewelry for the next several months to get on her good side again. God, why couldn’t Dad just wait and let Mom empty his balls tonight?! We love Dad, but this one’s on him."
Dangerous New Trend: Teens Everywhere Are Taking Twice The Daily Recommended Dose Of Magnesium In Order To Regulate Muscle Function And Improve Sleep Efficiency,N/A,https://clickhole.com/dangerous-new-trend-teens-everywhere-are-taking-twice-the-daily-recommended-dose-of-magnesium-in-order-to-regulate-muscle-function-and-improve-sleep-efficiency/,"Parents, listen up, because there’s a new craze going around that might just be putting your teen at risk: Teens everywhere are taking twice the daily recommended dose of magnesium in order to regulate muscle function and improve sleep efficiency. What?! Don’t these kids realize that decisions to supplement their diet must be made under the direction of a healthcare professional?  This scary new trend first debuted in a TikTok post in which one teen reveals how much better her sleep and recovery post-workout have been since she started doubling the recommended daily allowance (RDA) of magnesium. After the video went viral, it spawned what teens are calling the “RDA double,” a trend in which teens record themselves popping a double dose of magnesium, followed by a time lapse video of their uninterrupted eight hours of rest set to Passion Pit’s 2009 hit “Sleepyhead.” With magnesium supplements widely available in grocery and drug stores, it’s going to be almost impossible to regulate teens’ intake of the mineral, which is why it’s crucial to observe the warning signs in your own home. If you hear your teen talking about their “total muscle glow-up” or their “high-key Zzz’s,” there’s a good chance that they’re participating in this terrifying trend. Although your teen’s magnesium intake may give them positive results at first, ingesting such a high dose of the mineral can come with devastating side-effects in the long run, including nausea and abdominal cramping. To avoid serious stomach upset, it’s crucial that teens take no more than the RDA, and certainly not double. As the magnesium trend has swept through high schools across the country, teens have even begun to self-identify with their preferred type of magnesium via terms such as “citrate gang” or “team malate.” While it might feel like your teen is a lost cause if you find a bottle of magnesium under their bed, remember that it’s never too late for a chat about how it’s best to try to get nutrients from whole foods before resorting to supplements, and how, if supplementation is required, it’s essential to first consult a professional to decide what dose is appropriate for your body type and level of physical activity. Let this be a wake-up call to parents—if you suspect your child might be participating in this magnesium trend, it may be time to order a blood work panel to see for yourself. Stay alert, adults!!"
"Good For You, Mom, But It’s Not Like You Were Using It Before: Mom Has Banned Foie Gras In Her Kitchen",N/A,https://clickhole.com/good-for-you-mom-but-its-not-like-you-were-using-it-before-mom-has-banned-foie-gras-in-her-kitchen/,"Foie gras, a delicacy produced by force-feeding ducks and geese so that their livers swell to several times their natural size, has long been banned in several countries and U.S. states, and a new ban on the food item has recently taken effect, though we do have to say that this one seems pretty goddamned inconsequential: Mom has banned foie gras in her kitchen. That’s very noble, Mom, but you’ve never cooked foie gras in your life. You haven’t even eaten it. After stumbling upon a recent article in her Facebook feed about foie gras producers in New York state, Mom was so appalled by the practice that she issued a formal household ban, stating that “absolutely NO meat made from force-fed animals” will ever cross the threshold of her kitchen—which frankly should not be an issue, since the only meat products anyone has ever seen come into that space are chicken breast and the occasional 95% lean hamburger meat. Mom was deeply affected when she learned that foie gras birds are kept in painfully tight conditions and cruelly force-fed for the duration of their lives, and she has stated repeatedly that she has “no idea why someone would want to do that,” which tracks given that she has no clue what foie gras tastes like or why it is considered a delicacy, and has possibly never even met anyone who has consumed foie gras in her lifetime. Plus, they don’t even sell it at Aldi or Kroger, which are the only two grocery stores Mom has ever gone to. Mom has been walking around all day perusing the foie gras article she read, saying “it’s so wrong,” and “I’m sickened that I didn’t ban this earlier.” Which is impressively high-minded of her, but again, there has pretty much been a de-facto ban on foie gras in Mom’s house since 1995, which was around when she started cooking lemon chicken and a plain house salad for every single dinner of the week. Mom seems to think that the stand she’s making may have a major impact on the foie gras debate, and is now even pressuring her Facebook friends to join her in her anti-foie gras crusade. But clearly her efforts won’t make any more of a difference than if she were to, say, vow to never order a drone strike on innocent civilians abroad—it’s a nice thought, but also not something we were ever worried she would take part in. While we’re glad Mom is taking an interest in animal welfare, there are definitely better ways she could live out her convictions than putting a household prohibition on a food that’s never once entered her household. Whatever, though. Maybe we should just let her have this one."
Full Transparency: This Gas Station Bathroom’s Cleaning Logsheet Has Another Sheet Next To It Listing All The Times Someone Absolutely Lit The Place Up,N/A,https://clickhole.com/full-transparency-this-gas-station-bathrooms-cleaning-logsheet-has-another-sheet-next-to-it-listing-all-the-times-someone-absolutely-lit-the-place-up/,"If you value business transparency, you’re going to get on your feet and applaud the way one Casey’s General Store in Tabor, Iowa is prioritizing honesty with their customers: This gas station bathroom’s cleaning logsheet has another sheet next to it listing all the times someone absolutely lit the place up.  Nice!  While it’s standard for gas stations to post a cleaning log in their restrooms, this Casey’s location has really gone the extra mile by logging and dating every instance that a customer or employee has utterly blown up a bathroom with their ass. The stink-out log includes a date-by-date recording of who, when, and exactly how the bathroom was blasted with the stench of Hell itself, with detail-specific columns documenting the bodily wastes involved, the amount of mess on the floor/walls, and whether the restroom was rendered completely unusable or if it was the type of situation where, if you had to go really bad, you could just suck it up, plug your nose, and try your luck on one of the less disgusting toilets. Though this logsheet of each time someone held a fecal cookout in the bathroom may seem like a small gesture, it’s often the small courtesies that count most in making a happy customer. By letting patrons know how recently the bathroom was full-on nuked with human excrement, every Casey’s customer is empowered to enter at their own risk or hold it in until they go home.  What a thoughtful touch! Let’s hope other businesses take note and start being as transparent as Casey’s is about the foul ass-problems that occur in company restrooms. Seems like it should be a common courtesy!"
Hell Yes: IKEA’s Newest Viral Product Is A Swedish Man Who You Can Sit On Top Of,N/A,https://clickhole.com/hell-yes-ikeas-newest-viral-product-is-a-swedish-man-who-you-can-sit-on-top-of/,"From their versatile FADO orb lamp to their ubiquitous LACK coffee table, IKEA has put out dozens of wildly popular home decor items that can find a place in any apartment or home. And it looks like they’ve got another hit on their hands: IKEA’s newest viral product is a Swedish man you can sit on top of. Wow! Prepare to see these in all of your friends’ apartments. The SVEN, the newest item in IKEA’s seating collection, is a quiet, mild-mannered Swedish man in his 30s that can be styled and positioned in various ways as a seating option for your living room, bedroom, or even your lawn. SVEN can be placed upright, laid face-down on the floor, or moved in countless other ways so that one or more people may sit on his lap, belly, or back. And unlike a typical chair, SVEN makes an interesting “oof” sound any time you sit down on him. There are many accessories sold along with the Sven—he can wear one of several muumuu style outfits to match your decor, or a skintight nude suit. IKEA has also rolled out holiday friendly options for the SVEN, like a Santa suit and Easter bunny costume, as well as a full-body wetsuit that can be used to waterproof the SVEN for use as patio furniture. Many TikTokers and Instagram design influencers have already made use of the SVEN in their homes. One interior designer posted footage from a recent dinner party at which she served food on her coffee table and allowed her guests to sit on SVEN like a bench, even capturing some of them feeding him pieces of sashimi, which he accepted happily but not greedily. According to IKEA’s website, the Sven does require feeding. Thankfully, they sell nutritional pellets, and some influencers have even created an IKEA “hack” by storing said pellets in a cute ceramic IKEA bowl rather than the more utilitarian one provided with the SVEN product. Though he typically doesn’t speak unless spoken to, you can also have short conversations with the SVEN; many influencers have filmed themselves asking SVEN whether he misses his original home, to which he typically says “At times.” This is too cool. We need to get our hands on this awesome product immediately! Well done, IKEA!"
The Last Remaining Testament To A Long Lost Artifact: This Old Spanish Textbook Keeps Mentioning ‘An Accompanying CD-ROM’,N/A,https://clickhole.com/the-last-remaining-testament-to-a-long-lost-artifact-this-old-spanish-textbook-keeps-mentioning-an-accompanying-cd-rom/,"The ravages of time inevitably claim many wondrous relics from our distant past, but the memory of one particularly intriguing artifact has nevertheless managed to live on in the written record: This old Spanish textbook keeps mentioning “an accompanying CD-ROM.” This was clearly an object of much importance. What we wouldn’t give to have seen it with our own eyes! Though no physical trace remains of the accompanying CD-ROM spoken of in this beat-up Introductory Spanish textbook, the disc’s presence still looms large over Señorita Cooper’s 9th grade Spanish class even today, turning up in constant references throughout the musty tome. Students can scarcely go three pages without seeing the CD-ROM’s name invoked for some arcane, cryptic purpose, and the textbook’s stiff front cover reveals a plastic sleeve once opened that likely served as a reliquary for the CD-ROM when it wasn’t being employed in one of these rituals. Of course the sleeve has lain empty for untold ages since the CD-ROM was lost or looted or destroyed in some great cataclysm, but simply imagining its iridescent hues peering out from the sleeve’s cloudy plastic allows one to feel a faint echo of its wonder, however diminished it may be. The textbook offers us tantalizing clues as to how the missing CD-ROM would have appeared and been used in classroom life. We know that it was a central component of so-called “listening module” ceremonies that took place several times per unit, granting its users valuable insight into the rhythms and intonations of beginner’s conversational Spanish. We can also surmise from its sleeve and surviving examples of CD-ROMs from the era that it was likely flat, 3 to 4 inches in diameter, and perhaps bore some depiction of flamenco dancers to match the image on the textbook’s cover. And while the specifics of the CD-ROM’s “unit quiz” questions have been lost to the ages, it’s probable that the CD-ROM offered students a rite of passage through which they could demonstrate their mastery of topics such as -ar verb conjugation and restaurant vocabulary terms, eventually allowing those who accumulated the most status to place into the coveted 10th grade Honors Spanish track. Close your eyes, and you can almost hear those teachers of yore saying “Saquen sus CD-ROMs, por favor” on the breeze. While efforts are being made to preserve the old Spanish textbook with protective coverings fashioned out of brown paper grocery bags, the day may come that the textbook itself also passes from this world and humanity’s final link to the lost CD-ROM is severed. That will be a great loss indeed, but thankfully due to widespread underfunding and budget cuts throughout the school district, the looming specter of new Spanish textbooks being purchased to replace this old one likely remains many decades off on the horizon, giving future generations a chance to learn for themselves of the “accompanying CD-ROM” that once was. Wow, this stuff really makes you feel connected to the past. Here’s hoping Señorita Cooper’s students appreciate just what a fascinating historical document their Spanish textbook really is!"
A Fool Through And Through: This Woman Thinks She Might Be Better At Working If She Had A Slightly Different Desk,N/A,https://clickhole.com/a-fool-through-and-through-this-woman-thinks-she-might-be-better-at-working-if-she-had-a-slightly-different-desk/,"There’s nothing wrong with wanting to be a better version of yourself, but to think you can do so through easy fixes that require little to no effort is foolish, if not downright delusional. Case in point: This woman thinks she might be better at working if she had a slightly different desk. Wow. It’s not gonna work, lady! Kelly Mattheson of Raleigh, North Carolina has been working from home as a graphic designer for the past three years, and has recently been struggling with procrastination and lack of focus—two problems that she is convinced would magically disappear if only she were to purchase a marginally bigger, marginally more attractive desk with perhaps a different drawer configuration or leg height than the one she has now. Each day, Kelly finds herself in a slump by 10:30 am, and is barely able to complete the bare minimum work she needs to do. But rather than get up and exercise or meditate in order to focus her mind, she spends literal hours googling terms like “desk height productivity” and “interior design energy levels” under the impression that dropping $600 on a different surface for her computer would somehow fundamentally change her work ethic, cognitive abilities, and overall career trajectory. Kelly has convinced herself that the five inch difference in length between the desk she has and the kind she wants could make or break her future job prospects, as having the extra space where she could place a notebook might make her more apt to write down important specs and ideas for her projects, even though absolutely nothing about her existing work habits would suggest she’ll actually follow through with this. Kelly can vividly imagine herself pounding out efficient eight hour workdays at almost any other desk than the one she has currently, despite the fact that a different desk would not in any way thwart the actual factors that are preventing her from getting work done, like her social media addiction, gossipping with coworkers on Slack, and going off to tend to her dog any time she feels even the slightest bit of boredom.  Some people do literally all their work at their kitchen table and are perfectly fine, but okay, Kelly. Clearly, it’s not Kelly’s desk that’s holding her back. What’s likely holding her back is the fact that she actively hates her job, which is why she does not work hard at it. It must also be noted that her current desk is perfectly serviceable and in fact not all that different from any of the ones she’s coveting. Still, she feels strongly that her current desk is simply “not inspiring enough,” and that there is “just something about a nice desk” that “makes you sit down and get to it.” Go figure. Good luck to Kelly, though, and here’s hoping that, new desk or not, she’s able to find the motivation she needs to turn things around."
"Embarrassing: Dad’s Going On A Rant About Elizabeth Holmes, But He Keeps Calling Her Elizabeth Smart, And Like Half The Stuff He’s Saying Is Actually About Casey Anthony",N/A,https://clickhole.com/embarrassing-dads-going-on-a-rant-about-elizabeth-holmes-but-he-keeps-calling-her-elizabeth-smart-and-like-half-the-stuff-hes-saying-is-actually-about-casey-anthony/,"Get ready to cringe, because Dad’s once again managed to make us feel secondhand embarrassment as a result of his own stupidity: Dad’s going on a rant about Elizabeth Holmes, but he keeps calling her Elizabeth Smart, and like half the stuff he’s saying is actually about Casey Anthony.  Classic fucking Dad. So, like 15 minutes ago, Mom brought up having to get a standard blood test done, which seemed like a pretty harmless thing to say at dinner—but unfortunately, it set Dad off on an emotional rant that has had a max of like, 30 percent accuracy. As Mom started explaining her trip to LabCorp, Dad fully interrupted her to say, “That woman never should have duped all those billionaires with that blood machine,” which to Dad’s credit, is a pretty good grasp on what happened with Elizabeth Holmes and Theranos. Unfortunately, Dad immediately continued, “Elizabeth Smart ought to be in jail for what she did,” a sentence that he presumably thinks means that Elizabeth Holmes should be in jail for defrauding investors (which she actually is), but instead means that the kidnapping victim Elizabeth Smart should be in jail for… being kidnapped over 20 years ago? C’mon, Dad. Surely a Scranton University grad should know better than this. Tragically, though, Dad didn’t stop there, and instead added, “It’s those Florida laws, I tell ya,” which was the first clue that Dad would now be confusing the two Elizabeths he had previously referenced with yet another woman who he was much too vaguely aware of to be talking about this passionately. “It’s just not right,” he said, shaking his head as he became more stoic. “It’s just not right!” he repeated, now banging his fists on the table. “How does a woman—a mother—do that to her own baby?”  Wow. That would’ve been a pretty moving statement from Dad about the Casey Anthony case if he didn’t conclude it by saying, “Elizabeth Smart should be hung for what she did!” Without taking a beat, Dad continued, saying, “Everyone with half a brain knows Elizabeth Smart drowned that kid,” which is not even how Casey Anthony allegedly murdered her daughter. He then added, “If you need any more proof, just look at what she did to Donald Trump! Taking his hush money then blabbing all about it! Call me old fashioned, but I think even hookers should have some decency!” which doesn’t fit the narrative about either Elizabeth or about Casey Anthony, and actually seems to be referencing Stormy Daniels instead. Jesus Christ. Look Dad, the reason no one is debating you isn’t, as you just declared, “Because you all know I’m right,” but because explaining how wrong you really are just isn’t worth the strength. Fingers crossed that the next time Dad gets carried away like this it’ll be about Steely Dan or the Mets, so at least the majority of what he says will be true. Yikes."
Taking A Stand: Minka Kelly Has Announced That Civil War Generals Who Fought On The Confederate Side Ain’t Getting None Of This,N/A,https://clickhole.com/taking-a-stand-minka-kelly-has-announced-that-civil-war-generals-who-fought-on-the-confederate-side-aint-getting-none-of-this/,"Celebrities’ silence on important social issues can often be deafening, but there are a handful of Hollywood stars who choose to use their privileged platforms to do more than just promote their latest vanity projects. The latest heroic example of a celeb who isn’t afraid to fight for what’s right? Minka Kelly has announced that Civil War generals who fought on the Confederate side ain’t getting none of this.  Boom! And that, folks, is how you stand up for what you believe in.  In a recent Instagram post, the Friday Night Lights star made her feelings on the possibility of hooking up with someone who commanded a battalion of troops in the Civil War known loud and clear. Under a smoking hot photo of herself, she wrote, “Heads up to any Confederate Civil War generals who want a piece: You ain’t getting none of this. What your side stood for in the Civil War—slavery and the oppression of human beings—is one of my biggest turn-offs. You can look, but you’ll never touch!!!!!! I’m talking to you, Stonewall Jackson. I’m talking to you, P.G.T. Beauregard.” The lengthy post caption went on to explain that “No matter how hot your white mutton chops are, no matter how many sexy cannonball scars you have, no matter what kind of prowess your cavalry showed on the battlefield with their sabers, no matter how many times your tactics deftly led your brigade to victory, you ain’t gonna hold my hand, you ain’t gonna kiss my lips, and we DEFINITELY ain’t going back to your canvas tent. For the crimes you committed against this nation and the human race you are forever in the Friend Zone, sorry not sorry. If you fought for the North, however, my DMs are wide open. That’s one of the many benefits of being a decent human being. Maybe you should try it sometime.” Yes yes yes Minka! Let those Confederate generals know that they’re never, ever getting a taste! More of this, please. Hollywood stars need to start finding the backbone to stand up for their beliefs like Minka even if it risks tainting their “brand.” Despicable people like the military officers who led combat units for the South in the Civil War shouldn’t be able to get with beautiful actresses like Minka Kelly, full stop. So her decision to stop playing it safe and say something about how there ain’t no way they’re gonna smash that is something that we, as a society, should celebrate. We are here for it! Bravo, Minka!"
Passing The Torch: Bruno Mars Has Taken Over For Michael Jackson As The Singer Who Exclusively Befriends Children And Looks Incredibly Sick,N/A,https://clickhole.com/passing-the-torch-bruno-mars-has-taken-over-for-michael-jackson-as-the-singer-who-exclusively-befriends-children-and-looks-incredibly-sick/,"If you love pop music, get ready for the most exciting news you’ll read all day, because one of today’s biggest stars is upholding the legacy of a pop icon in an amazing way: Bruno Mars has taken over for Michael Jackson as the singer who exclusively befriends children and looks incredibly sick.  What a beautiful moment in music history! If anyone should have a social circle of prepubescent kids and seem physically unwell all the time like Michael Jackson, it’s Bruno Mars! At a press conference held this morning, Bruno Mars appeared alongside an entourage of 12-year-olds to announce in a soft, effeminate voice that his new gaunt, pallid look and youthful friend group represent the legacy of the late Michael Jackson, which Mars has inherited with full approval from the Jackson estate. From now on, Bruno’s rebranded public image will be defined by his flying numerous children out across the country to go to amusement parks with him even though the only contact they’ve had is through fan mail, as well as choice to resemble a withered hospice care patient who someone keeps putting very expensive clothes on—a role that’s been left totally vacant by pop singers since the King of Pop’s passing in 2009.  “The world will always have Michael Jackson’s music, but when he died, we lost a cultural treasure in terms of having a massively popular singer who looks like a geisha, appears unable to eat solid foods, and only feels comfortable socializing with middle school-aged children—until now,” explained a soft-spoken Bruno Mars, who then whispered some sort of inside joke to one of the 12-year-olds that made them both giggle.  “I’m so honored to be this generation’s pale, visibly unwell singer whose stunted emotional development only allows them to bond with children. Michael Jackson left behind big shoes to fill, and with the support of my fans, I intend to do my best to be even sicker-looking and make best friends with even younger children. I’m having so much fun already!” continued Bruno, before weakly waving to the press like an effeminate mummy and then sharing a big cotton candy with a small caucasian boy dressed exactly like him.  So cool! It’s absolutely heartwarming to see Bruno Mars succeed Michael Jackson as the most iconic terminally ill, child-befriending, pop genius in the world. We’ll never have Michael Jackson in our lives again, but his legacy is living on in the coolest possible way. Congratulations and have fun, Bruno!"
The Darkened Cave Of Ignorance: This Toddler Does Not Know About 11,N/A,https://clickhole.com/the-darkened-cave-of-ignorance-this-toddler-does-not-know-about-11/,"There are those of us who know, and there are those of us who live life in the dark, as if chained inside the cave of ignorance, not even grasping that the light of knowledge exists just beyond our field of vision. For example: This toddler does not know about eleven. O, may he one day learn to count above ten and feel the warm rays of comprehension upon his brow! Two-and-a-half-year-old Grayson Tyler of Seattle, Washington enjoys enumerating toys, grapes, and even his fingers, delighting in his understanding of how many there are, but sadly, he is not enlightened to the vast potential they hold, as he has no idea that there can be eleven. Grayson has a vague understanding that there are numbers that come after ten, but, trapped as he is within his dense chamber of cluelessness, he believes that the next digit may be “ten” again. His parents have mentioned “eleven,” but the piercing brightness of its truth has been too much for Grayson to bear, and he has turned his head away in fear and disgust at the unknown, preferring instead to refer to the eleventh numeral a bastardized number of his own creation called “one-a-teen,” or to skip it all together. If he cannot escape the cave by his own volition, he must be dragged, for he cannot be kept from double-digit numbers forever! Grayson’s world is a safe one, but it is shrouded in the dank fog of incomprehension. He cannot understand that his cousin Julie, who is ten, will turn eleven this year, nor that after eleven comes the more shocking and powerful “twelve.” It can be hard to watch a human being, with its powers of logic and deduction, live in the dark as Grayson is, but there will come a time when he will leave the cave and see the light. One day, though it may nearly break him, he will come to know eleven."
A Nation Divided: Polls Show That Americans Have Become Irreparably Polarized Over Whether Elves Are Fun Little Wacky Guys Or Tall Graceful Hot Guys,N/A,https://clickhole.com/a-nation-divided-polls-show-that-americans-have-become-irreparably-polarized-over-whether-elves-are-fun-little-wacky-guys-or-tall-graceful-hot-guys/,"It’s become painfully clear that America is headed toward a breaking point, and new data suggests that one key issue could be the wedge that forever splits our country apart: Polls show that Americans have become irreparably polarized over whether elves are fun little wacky guys or tall graceful hot guys. Yikes. This whole thing is a powder keg just waiting to go off. In simpler times, Americans who considered elves to be kooky little goofballs were nevertheless able to tolerate and even embrace the fact that their neighbor might believe elves to be lithe, 6-foot-8 woodland hotties instead, and what’s more, they could expect to have that open-mindedness reciprocated. But sadly, a slew of recent polls have shown that dogmatism and rigid inflexibility over what kind of guys elves are have become the new American normal, with one Reuters poll showing that only 5 percent of people who think of elves as huge taciturn twinks with incredible posture have at least one friend who disagrees, and that number falling to a dismal 3 percent among Americans who think elves are knee-high rapscallions always giggling about acorns. Worse yet, the only remaining point of national consensus seems to be a willingness to escalate the conflict, with 80 percent of all respondents to an AP poll agreeing that violence may soon be necessary to defend their beliefs about the relative silliness and sexual desirability of elves. It’s not hard to see how we got here. Internet echo chambers have made it easier than ever for someone’s vague sense that elves are skilled at archery to boil over into a rabid insistence that elves could only ever be dignified heartthrobs with single-digit BMIs and zero body hair. The algorithm serves them up an endless stream of content reinforcing their belief that elves glide elegantly through the forest without making a sound like aloof, sexy shadows, while also demonizing those who think elves might instead loudly sing songs about gingerbread while they sweep their miniature homes with an upside-down dandelion. Combine that with an increasingly atomized society with fewer and fewer public spaces to go out and meet real people who can put a human face on the idea that elves are diminutive, treat-obsessed klutzes, and it’s not long before a once-sane individual is throwing hands in a parking lot over a complete stranger’s “I Brake For Nutty Little Elves” bumper sticker. How do you even begin to reconcile this level of ideological conflict? “Listen, an elf is a hot guy with a name like Mithéonor who crafts exquisite enchanted swords that also have names, end of fucking story,” said one respondent to a survey conducted by Stanford University, offering a dark glimpse into the extreme viewpoints that now constitute mainstream American thought about elves. “Elves do NOT have names like Hucklebud, and they sure as shit don’t wear cute little caps that slip down over their eyes when they get drowsy from eating too many honeycakes. Anybody tries to tell me that elves don’t cast smoldering glances while recounting ancient prophecies in a lyrical elven tongue, they’re gonna spend the next 3 months eating through a tube.” Jeez, our country is really coming apart at the seams. Here’s hoping Americans can remember that at the end of the day, we all think that elves have pointed ears and are weird in an exciting way! "
"Finally Growing Up: General Mills Has Announced That The Cocoa Puffs Bird Now Reacts To Cereal In A Non-Cuckoo, Adult Way",N/A,https://clickhole.com/finally-growing-up-general-mills-has-announced-that-the-cocoa-puffs-bird-now-reacts-to-cereal-in-a-non-cuckoo-adult-way/,"Sonny the Cuckoo Bird, the longtime mascot for Cocoa Puffs, is known for his frantic and crazed love for the chocolatey breakfast cereal. However, it seems like General Mills has decided it’s time for the mascot to grow up, because the company just announced that the Cocoa Puffs bird now reacts to cereal in a non-cuckoo, adult way. Wow. It’s good to see Sonny finally behaving like an adult.  For decades, a staple of every Cocoa Puffs commercial was Sonny the Cuckoo Bird doing whatever it took to get his hands on a bowl of Cocoa Puffs before shouting his signature catchphrase, “I’m cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs!” But according to an announcement made by General Mills this morning, Sonny the Cuckoo Bird’s eyes will no longer pop six feet out of his skull at the sight of Cocoa Puffs, nor will he maniacally pinball off the walls in anticipation of the chocolatey taste, as he now feels that cereal is just something you eat sometimes and there’s not much else to it. “While Sonny’s hysterical reaction to a bowl of cereal has long been an iconic part of the Cocoa Puffs brand, he’s an adult now, and he needs to react to cereal in a normal, adult way instead of like a drug-addled lunatic,” explained General Mills in a press release. “No one can go nuts over a bowl of cereal forever. Now that Sonny is an adult, he understands that cereal is merely a food he can buy at the store with money from his marketing job whenever he wants. He could take it or leave it, like all adults do.” The company’s announcement was accompanied by a new commercial which begins with a shot of Sonny waking up at 6 a.m. in a sparse high rise apartment. He puts on a pot of coffee and opens up his pantry for something to eat. He takes out a canister of oatmeal, but realizes it’s empty. He sees a box of Cocoa Puffs and takes it out. He stares at the box for a moment, then shrugs and debuts his new catchphrase, “Hmm. These’ll do.” The commercial ends with a shot of Sonny quietly playing Wordle on his iPad as he calmly eats a bowl of Cocoa Puffs at the table. Damn. It seems like Sonny’s definitely all grown up now. General Mills continued to say that Sonny’s favorite breakfast food is no longer even Cocoa Puffs, but rather two eggs over medium with a side of avocado, but the company has assured customers that Sonny’s response even to that breakfast is just mild, reserved appreciation.  This is a major change for such a well-known mascot, but it looks like General Mills really felt like it was time for Sonny to chill out. Sound off below if you’re excited to see this new era of Sonny the Cuckoo Bird!"
The Next ‘Space Jam’? Scottie Pippen Has Written A Movie Where He’s Cousins/Roommates With Foghorn Leghorn,N/A,https://clickhole.com/the-next-space-jam-scottie-pippen-has-written-a-movie-where-hes-cousins-roommates-with-foghorn-leghorn/,"Get excited, Space Jam fans, because it looks like there just might be another movie in the works starring a ‘90s Chicago Bulls player and a Looney Tunes character: Scottie Pippen has announced that he’s written a movie where he’s cousins/roommates with Foghorn Leghorn. Whoa!  In a press release earlier today, six-time NBA champion Scottie Pippen proudly revealed that he has finished writing a movie called Cousin Trouble (Mars Jam) that will star himself and Foghorn Leghorn, the southern-talking rooster from the Looney Tunes. Pippen announced that he’s been working on the 34-page script since he retired in 2008, and that he couldn’t be more excited to play cousins/roommates with Foghorn Leghorn in what he promises will be a “realistic portrayal of cousins/roommates life, and Michael Jordan won’t be in it at all.” “In the movie me and Foghorn Leghorn are cousins/roommates. We fight all the time because he’s always getting chicken feed in my Doritos, and chicken feed is disgusting/smells,” explained Pippen in the press release. “Anyway, me and Foghorn’s problems only get worse when our apartment burns down. With only two days’ notice, we scramble to find a new apartment. Fortunately, we find one. Unfortunately, it’s on Mars.” “So then me and Foghorn go up to Mars where our new landlord is Scrooge McDuck,” continued Pippen. “Foghorn knows Scrooge McDuck from Bird College, where they were once roommates/nemeses. So that’s not good. Then me and Foghorn go to pay rent, but we realize we don’t have any Mars Bucks, so we challenge Scrooge McDuck to basketball. If we win, we keep the apartment. If we don’t, we get turned into asteroids. Fortunately, we win easily and without Michael Jordan’s help, since he isn’t even there. Also, I score all the points without even needing a long cartoon arm, and Lola Bunny is dating me, not Bugs Bunny, who isn’t there either.” Pippen then shared a snippet of the script in hopes of attracting the interest of movie studios:  Awesome!  If any studio execs out there want to produce what could very well be the next Space Jam, you better get in touch with Pippen ASAP. Here’s hoping that someday we’ll get to see this on the big screen! "
Another Damning Report: A New Study Has Revealed The Vast Majority Of Retired NFL Players Look Weird In Suits ,N/A,https://clickhole.com/another-damning-report-a-new-study-has-revealed-the-vast-majority-of-retired-nfl-players-look-weird-in-suits/,"Football is an exciting sport, but it has its dark side. Yet another controversy surrounding the potential risks of playing professional football is brewing after some alarming data has come to light: A new study has revealed that the vast majority of retired NFL players look weird in suits.  Wow. You have to ask yourself if a game is worth this. A damning study by Rutgers University has found that a troubling percentage of former football players struggle in retirement to not look absolutely insane in suits, whether it’s massive ex-linemen sporting jackets so constricting that they look like they’re going to explode, or muscular ex-tight ends in distractingly bright seersucker get-ups with incredibly wide purple ties that resemble something a clown might wear. On the field, these men were leaders and role models who performed at the highest level, yet, tragically, after retiring, many appear awkward and out of their element, donning outrageous, ill-fitting teal suits that somehow make them look both gigantic and tiny at the same time—pitiful shadows of the dominant forces they once were in their playing days, seemingly unequipped to function off the field.      The study, which compared a group of retired NFL players in suits to a group of similarly aged men in suits who didn’t play professional football, found that the men in the NFL group were over 50 times more likely to look downright bizarre in formalwear, demonstrating a strong predisposition towards wearing suits that appear baggy in some parts and comically tight in others, not unlike standing in front of a funhouse mirror. The disturbing results have already prompted many to deem this a crisis, one that must be met with aggressive reforms by the NFL for the sake of its players’ welfare. “When players enter the league, they’re focused on playing football—they’re not thinking at all about how strange and off-putting they might appear in a suit 15 or 20 years down the line,” said the NFL Players Association in a statement. “There’s clearly a strong need for young players to be educated on the risks of having a refrigerator-sized body and wearing slim, tailored garments—it’s just not at all compatible, like trying to stuff a cinder block into a tube sock. We are calling on the league to provide the necessary resources to address this urgent issue so that players no longer go through their post-playing days in wildly patterned, absurdly proportioned garments that make them look like they’re playing dress-up with a bunch of clothes from their grandpa’s closet.” The statement went on to confirm that the NFLPA will also be pursuing a nine-figure settlement from the league to fund new wardrobes for retired players so that they are no longer jarringly distracting to look at whenever they appear on a sports talk show or at an alumni charity event. Good for them. These players deserve better. Will this study turn off NFL fans enough to change the channel to a new sport? Unlikely, as NFL fans didn’t need a study to tell them that retired NFL players look super weird in suits. But hopefully the study will be a catalyst for at least some sort of change, whether it be from the league or even just a clothing brand that develops a line of suits specifically tailored to accommodate former players’ hulking mutant bodies. Whatever the case, here’s hoping that former players get the help they need."
"Dude, All We Did Was Walk Around The Track For 30 Minutes: This Kid Is Taking A Full-On Shower In The Locker Room After PE",N/A,https://clickhole.com/dude-all-we-did-was-walk-around-the-track-for-30-minutes-this-kid-is-taking-a-full-on-shower-in-the-locker-room-after-pe/,"Gym class at Souderton High School was extremely easy today, but that doesn’t seem to matter for one freshman who’s now cleaning himself off like he just finished a goddamn marathon: This kid is taking a full-on shower in the locker room after PE.  Dude, we literally barely even moved during gym today, there’s no reason for you to shower. Even though today’s activity in PE was “fitness running,” which is when the gym teachers just let everyone walk around the track slowly for 30 minutes before going back inside, 14-year-old Ben Freeman straight up started taking a shower the second he got back to the locker room. Despite the fact that it was 58 degrees out today and there’s literally no way he worked up a sweat, Ben stripped out of his gym clothes, took off his SpongeBob boxers, and proceeded to diligently shower butt-ass naked in front of a bunch of his peers. While he could have had a bit of privacy and used the handicap shower stall that has a curtain, he inexplicably opted to shower right out in the open instead, his wet dong glistening for all to see. Is it an exhibitionist thing? Like, there’s legit no reason for anyone to be using their five minutes of free time before heading off to a real class to stand naked in a dingy-as-hell shower that hasn’t been updated since the ‘70s.  Maybe if we played something intense like dodgeball or floor hockey it would make more sense that Ben wanted to shower in water that only reaches room temperature at warmest, but even then just some deodorant or a couple spritzes of Axe would do the trick. The situation isn’t helped by the fact that Ben clearly forgot his shower sandals today, too, which would’ve been a good reason against this totally unnecessary shower. Didn’t Ben hear the rumor about how a few years ago, one of the seniors got herpes from taking a barefoot shower right in this very locker room?  Yikes. Gonna be honest, we’d make an exception for Ben if he had a really troubled home life and we thought he didn’t have access to a shower anywhere else. However, his dad’s a lawyer, so it’s definitely not that. Kid’s just fucking weird. He’s just standing there unabashedly with his dong in full view like an old man at the YMCA, apparently unaware that it’s common courtesy to keep your dick pointed at the wall in school showers so your classmates don’t have to see. The gym teacher just walked past and did a double take, almost like he was gonna yell at him or something—just couldn’t make heads or tails of what was happening. To top it all off, the bell’s about to ring and there’s zero chance Ben will have time to fully dry off, so he’s gonna have to run soaking-wet to his next class, lugging his trumpet case with his hair dripping all over the faded shirt he wears at least twice a week with a picture of Garfield that says “I’m here. What more do you want?” All in all, this seems like an awful lot of trouble for a shower that wasn’t warranted in the slightest.  Pretty weird, if you ask us. Guess the kid’s just excited that there are showers now that he’s in high school. Word to the wise, Ben: Next time you go to take a shower, look around and see if anybody else is lathering up in there. If not, that’s your sign that maybe you shouldn’t be either."
This Is Best Sex I’ve Ever Had!!??!!! (by George R.R. Martin),N/A,https://clickhole.com/this-is-best-sex-ive-ever-had-by-george-r-r-martin/," Just moments ago I was watching The Tonight Show with my wife, but now…now I am seeking and providing pleasure with the vengeance of a king usurped from his throne. As I lay here prone, the pallid white flesh of my thighs shining in the candlelight, this electric typewriter balanced on my formidable belly, I can without hesitation attest that this is the best sex I have ever had in my entire 74 years of life!!!!!!!!??! Like two large medieval armies who have decided mid-battle not to fight, but to fuck, we are going at it something fierce. And it feels so, so goddamn good!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! My partner, her face rose-red from the abrasion of my whiskered jowls, is asking if the handjob she is giving me right now is pleasurable to me, and I am nodding furiously. I’d just as soon have my cock chopped off entirely as I’d have her stop stroking my shaft at this moment, for to have this pleasure torn away from me would be akin to the death of my boner. Her grip is firm, her nails are well-manicured, and she is making intense eye contact with me with a big smile on her face. This is exactly what I like. My penis feels so great right now, I am thinking aloud. I must continue to document this as best I can, so the world may understand the incredible sexual feeling of being me right now. Please hold, for I must change positions.  So sorry. Now on my hands and knees with my wife beneath me and my typewriter carefully balanced upon her breasts, I am thrusting whilst typing in synchronous rhythm, so please excuse any typos. Anyone who believes the missionary position is “boring” has clearly never done it the way I am doing it right now, with my legs held tightly together and my arms sprawled out like I’ve been crucified. The pleasures I am currently experiencing are undoubtedly the greatest ever bestowed upon me, and that is surely saying something, as I have oft explored the vexing creases and passageways of women’s bodies. But this is on a whole new level of fuck!!!!!! We have moved to the floor. Draped under the humid fog our bodies are emitting like sexual smokestacks, my lover and I are exploring the deepest reaches of this misty carnal forest of lips, buttholes, and grunts. I am kissing her arms and teats and she is screaming my name. “George R.R. Martin! Bestselling author of my earth-shattering orgasm!” she cries, her voice echoing out of the window and arousing passersby. I stop only to sip my herbal tea and manifest this tome, as this is the greatest sexual adventure of my lifetime, if not all lifetimes. Hearing my wife talking dirty to me, saying naughty words such as “intercourse” and “buttocks” means that not only is my body being pleasured, but my ears are as well. “Sex feels so good!” she is saying conversationally.  “This is how I always want to feel.” I am currently yelling to my wife. “Do me a favor and do this to me forever.” “OK, George,” she is answering. “I will try.” This sexual activity has found me quite well. I am nearing climax, so sadly, this story must end. But the legend of this love-making session will live on forever. For it has been the best sex I have ever had, and ever will!!!!!!!!"
Hard To Watch: Pope Francis Is Having An Emotional Breakdown At The Beach Because He Thinks The Dead Whale That Got Stranded There Is God,N/A,https://clickhole.com/hard-to-watch-pope-francis-is-having-an-emotional-breakdown-at-the-beach-because-he-thinks-the-dead-whale-that-got-stranded-there-is-god/,"We’re feeling pretty heartbroken right now, because a case of mistaken identity has resulted in one of the most gut-wrenching displays of grief we’ve ever seen: Pope Francis is having an emotional breakdown at the beach because he thinks the dead whale that got stranded there is God. Man, he’s really fucked up about this.  It’s sad enough that a majestic sperm whale lost its life after washing ashore over the weekend, but the grim scene at this beach became exponentially more tragic this morning when Pope Francis happened to pass by and mistook the enormous, rotting cetacean for God. Francis was joyful at first, shouting “Look! God has come down from Heaven to give a blessing to us all! Hallelujah!” and laughing as he skipped across the sand toward the bloated carcass. However, his delight soon turned to panicked despair as he realized the whale was motionless and emitting a suffocating stench of decay, causing him to freeze up and whimper “Lord? What has been done to you? Please, Lord, this cannot be!” in a voice so harrowing that we felt like we’d been punched in the stomach when we heard it. He then let out a pitiful, anguished cry and added, “Yahweh, please, do not leave us! We are lost without you, O master—please, let me die instead!”  In the desperate hours since, the Pope’s tried just about everything to rouse the dead whale he thinks is God; performing mouth-to-mouth on its blowhole, shoulder-tackling the whale’s rib cage as CPR, even hastily consecrating a couple communion wafers and stuffing them inside the whale’s mouth in a pitiful last-ditch effort to revive it with some kind of miracle, but this thing’s clearly been dead for a couple days and isn’t coming back. The poor guy spent almost 45 minutes alternately begging for God not to leave him alone and telling God he still had to raise Jesus, all while pleading with the gathering throng of onlookers for someone to call God a flatbed truck-sized ambulance. After a while though, his voice finally became so blown-out and hoarse that he could only sob “No no no no no” while plaintively beating his rosary against the whale’s swollen, rubbery abdomen, snot pouring down his upper lip. . Oof, no Pope ever wants to think he’s outlived the King of all creation! As upsetting as this has all been, the undisputed low point came an hour ago when a flock of seagulls came by and started picking chunks of flesh off the carcass. Pope Francis flipped the fuck out, screeching “They’re eating my Lord!” and running around throwing rocks at birds in a hysterical frenzy. While he was able to make a few of them drop their strips of meat so he could pathetically try to press them back into the whale’s body, the carcass was simply too large for the Pope to adequately protect all of it at once, and believe us when we tell you that you don’t ever want to see a grown man think that seabirds are devouring his Almighty God. And though the Pope failed to drive them off entirely, he did manage to really paste a few of the birds, so now there are a handful of squawking, mortally wounded seagulls lying around too, as if this whole depressing shitshow wasn’t traumatic enough already. Of course we know this whale carcass isn’t actually God, but the Pope’s intense sorrow is still very real, and it’s painful to see the normally jovial bishop of Rome reduced to such an absolute wreck. He’s just been staggering around the whale covered in tears and snot, clawing at his face and making this awful high-pitched bugle noise like a wounded elk. People have tried to tell him he’s got it all wrong, but it’s not like they can just call up God on the phone and have Him say “Relax dude, I’m fine!” At this point the Pope’s lying on the ground beside the whale with one of its flippers pulled over him like a blanket, and we’re hoping he’ll tire out and fall asleep ASAP, because some emergency response guys just showed up to cut the carcass into sections for disposal and we genuinely think the Pope might try to kill himself if he sees that. Damn, you don’t have to be Catholic to feel for the Pope’s perceived loss. Here’s hoping Pope Francis is able to deal with his grief or realize that the dead whale is not actually God as quickly as possible! "
"Ah, Guess That Makes Sense: Pop Secret Has Revealed That Their Secret Is Popcorn",N/A,https://clickhole.com/ah-guess-that-makes-sense-pop-secret-has-revealed-their-secret-is-popcorn/,"We learned something new about a beloved American snack brand today, and while the revelation doesn’t really change anything for us, we can’t act like it doesn’t have a certain logic to it: Pop Secret has revealed their secret is popcorn. Okay, yeah. “Popcorn” definitely tracks for that. Earlier this morning, Pop Secret sent out a press release explaining that the secret of Pop Secret—a mystery we’ve never wondered about or really even knew existed—is in fact popcorn, the type of food Pop Secret makes. Not knowing this has never stopped us from enjoying their product in the past, but it also doesn’t really modify any part of our experience now that they’ve told us about it either. Our feelings about Pop Secret are generally more informed by things like taste and price, which we’ve always considered “pretty good” and “reasonable” respectively, so this news about the secret being popcorn is at most a “Oh, okay” kind of revelation in our eyes, if that. “We’ve decided that today is the day to finally reveal our secret, so here it is: the secret of Pop Secret is none other than delicious, buttery popcorn,” said the company in their press release, explaining that popcorn has consistently been the secret all the way back to the brand’s launch in 1986. “It’s time you knew that the secret is popcorn for all Pop Secret products, including our Jumbo Popping Corn kernel jars, and even when we call a product Kettle Corn, the secret is still popcorn then too. We have held this secret closely for many years, but we’re excited now to finally share it with the world. Thank you.” The press release also highlighted a handful of “clues” to the secret that were supposedly “hiding in plain sight,” like the pieces of popcorn pictured on the packaging and the mention of “Whole Grain Popcorn” on the ingredients list, apparently under the impression that consumers were eager to crack the code and learn the forbidden knowledge—knowledge that we now know is “popcorn is what makes popcorn taste like popcorn.” Even if the information doesn’t particularly do much for us, it seems like the company has really relished enlightening the world to The Truth Of The Corn, so good for them, and good for anyone who guessed that the secret was popcorn all along. Not that it was a hard thing to guess. Like, honestly, what else could it have been? Pretty flimsy mystery, if you ask us.  Well, looks like Pop Secret’s thinking here pretty much checks out. We’ll see if knowing that the secret is popcorn changes anything the next time we make ourselves a bag, though to tell you the truth, we’ll probably forget this whole thing ever happened within a couple of hours."
Haven’t They Learned Their Lesson? Gawker Is Being Shut Down A Second Time After Posting Another Hulk Hogan Sex Tape,N/A,https://clickhole.com/havent-they-learned-their-lesson-gawker-is-being-shut-down-a-second-time-after-posting-another-hulk-hogan-sex-tape/,"Digital media history is repeating itself as the popular celebrity gossip site Gawker is being shut down once again for committing the exact same blunder that got them shut down before: Posting a sex tape starring Hulk Hogan.  Oof. This is terrible news for Gawker’s writers and staff, but they definitely should’ve known better. The graphic video, which features 46 minutes of grainy footage of a man clearly recognizable as Hulk Hogan having sex with an unidentified female while complaining that he ate too many tacos beforehand, was posted to the site’s home page at 7:30 EST this morning under the headline “WE GOT A SEQUEL, BROTHER! HULK HOGAN IS BACK AT IT WITH ANOTHER SEX TAPE” with a blurb stating, “Whatcha gonna do when Hulkamania runs wild on you? Apparently set up a tripod and film every last lurid, grunt-filled moment.” Within hours of the sex tape going live, parent company BDG Media announced plans to suspend publication of Gawker effective immediately, clearly seeking to distance itself both editorially and legally from the blog that in just 2016 was slapped with a $140 million judgment for posting a different Hulk Hogan sex tape. The costly judgment, which pushed Gawker into bankruptcy, has since served as the ultimate cautionary tale for digital media companies looking to push the boundaries of free speech. The site was later purchased and relaunched by BDG Media, which presumably did so with zero intention of ever incurring another exorbitant, no-holds-barred legal battle against an elderly professional wrestler bankrolled by billionaire Peter Thiel.  C’mon, Gawker. Sure, everyone wants to see the Hulkster in action, but you really should’ve learned your lesson after what happened last time. Your heart goes out to the writers who are going to be lining up at the unemployment office come next Monday, but you also can’t help wondering what the hell they were thinking. Did they really think posting another Hulk Hogan sex tape would result in a positive outcome? They’ve got no one to blame but themselves here."
Beautiful: This Absolutely Enormous German Child Blew A Fart On A Dandelion And Wished For Sausage,N/A,https://clickhole.com/beautiful-this-absolutely-enormous-german-child-blew-a-fart-on-a-dandelion-and-wished-for-sausage/,"If you’ve been feeling cynical about the state of the world these days, get ready for a much-needed reminder of how beautiful life can be, because something truly magical just occurred in an open field on the outskirts of Trendelburg, Germany: This absolutely enormous German child blew a fart on a dandelion and wished for sausage. We’re not crying, you’re crying! According to sources, the sun had been setting over Trendelburg when Arndt, a 180 lb. pre-teen who had spent the afternoon skipping around his Opa’s wheat field while tooting traditional German folk songs on his tuba, decided to rest his legs and plop down atop a hill overlooking his village. Realizing how famished he was from all his merry frolicking, Arndt proceeded to do something amazing: he plucked a dandelion from the ground, squatted down, placed the flower up to his anus, shut his eyes, privately wished for weisswurst sausage with all his heart, and blew away all its seeds with a spirited blast of hot gas from his butthole. “A sausage would make me the happiest child in all of the village—oh!! How nice it would taste!” squealed Arndt while basking in his lingering fart, its pungence as overwhelmingly intense as his desire for endless links of delicious sausage. “Whoever is out there listening…I will be a good boy forever and forever, if you only grant my sausage wish!” Watching the ass-propelled dandelion seeds float out over the fields in the golden hour light, Arndt let out a heavy sigh of longing that strained his lederhosen at the seams. Little did this squishy boy know that what to him might’ve just felt like a silly wish for sausage was actually a profound expression of what it truly means to be a human being, revealing the deep hope and yearning that courses through our marrow and drives us to keep going, to keep believing that brighter days are ahead no matter how dark or sausageless things may seem.  “Oh! I mustn’t tell a soul what I wished for, or it may not come true—not even meine mutti!” cried the large boy, giddily flapping his arms. What’s even more beautiful is that Arndt had taken care to wish for juicy links of weisswurst sausages not just for himself, but also for all his friends and family. “I wish a sausage for everyone in my village: Käthe, Helmut the clockmaker, Inge, Little Gerhard, and even Jörg, who picks on me. I wish there to be sausage for everyone, but—oh!—I pray that my sausage will be the most delicious!” So heartwarming! Whether Arndt gets the sausage he dreams of or not, he’ll have succeeded in inspiring countless people with his simple act of farting wishfully on a dandelion. We could all stand to learn a little something from this sweet, heavy child. Fingers crossed that your wish comes true, Arndt!"
What A Waste: These Kids Managed To Contact Abraham Lincoln With A Ouija Board But Spent The Whole Time Asking Him To Describe His ‘Perfect Sunday’,N/A,https://clickhole.com/what-a-waste-these-kids-managed-to-contact-abraham-lincoln-with-a-ouija-board-but-spent-the-whole-time-asking-him-to-describe-his-perfect-sunday/,"Get ready for the most aggravating story you’re going to hear all day, because a group of children in Bethesda, Maryland have just made the biggest mistake of their young lives: These kids managed to contact Abraham Lincoln with a ouija board but spent the whole time asking him to describe his “perfect Sunday.” God, what a waste of an incredible opportunity. Last night while playing with a ouija board during a slumber party, the six teenage girls attending Ariana Collymore’s 14th birthday celebration made contact with the spirit of Abraham Lincoln. Rather than ask the nation’s 16th president for words of wisdom or historical accounts of life during the Civil War, the teens immediately began asking Lincoln’s spirit questions about his ideal day off of work. We could have learned what President Lincoln had to say about our nation’s current political strife, or his thoughts on the war between Russia and Ukraine. Instead, we now know that his ideal Sunday consists of “waving hello to Mary Todd” and “smiling at the flag.” The only redeeming moment during the botched séance was when Ariana’s friend Samantha tried to ask President Lincoln’s spirit if he had “enjoyed the Civil War,” which was a question that at least had some historical value. Unfortunately, once Lincoln’s ghost had used the ouija board to answer, “Yes,” Ariana immediately derailed the conversation again by asking if President Lincoln had a “dream car.” Lincoln’s ghost responded “M-A-Z-D-A M-A-Z-D-A M-A-Z-D-A” while causing the furniture to shake and fly around the room. Other questions of dubious historical value that the girls asked President Lincoln included, “Who is your best friend in Heaven?” (to which Lincoln answered “C-H-A-R-L-E-S M-A-N-S-O-N”) and, “Why did you wear that hat all the time?” (to which Lincoln answered “I H-I-D B-I-R-D U-N-D-E-R-N-E-A-T-H”). After this last question, Lincoln’s ghost used the ouija board to say, “G-O-O-D-B-Y-E F-O-R-E-V-E-R” before permanently severing his psychic link to the realm of the living. Honestly, this is just embarrassing for these kids. They had a once-in-a-lifetime chance to talk to one of the most significant figures in American history and they totally blew it. We now know a bunch of useless information about Abraham Lincoln’s perfect Sunday and few personal tidbits about his fondness for Mazdas, but have no greater insight into the man himself. What a shame."

The fact that Grandma announced the death of the man that she had been married to for 68 years by commenting, “R.I.p Herschel Stewart,,, ‘PAPAW’ he Will bemissed,” under a blurry photo of two distant bison that her sister took on her trip to Yellowstone nine years ago that has zero Likes really illustrates that the woman has no clue how to harness the full potential of her social media feeds. So far, the incredibly important post only has a single Wow react from someone Grandma doesn’t even know, which indicates nearly no one in her feed has seen the post or, if they have, they’ve glossed over it because her message wasn’t communicated in a clear and engaging way.  The list of mistakes that Grandma made here are myriad, but let’s start with the most obvious: This announcement would have performed best in her main feed. A simple post announcing the news of Grandpa’s passing paired with a carefully selected photo of Grandpa looking like a badass when he was in the Navy uploaded around 11:30 AM CST would have been all Grandma needed to get the algorithm’s ball rolling with some Heart and Sad reacts, and from there, she could have driven further engagement by responding to her followers’ questions about what happened and where the memorial service is going to be in the comments.  There are times when commenting on someone’s post can actually be great for boosting your engagement, but a decade-old photo on the page of a woman with 19 Facebook friends who’s been dead for three years is simply about the worst place to do it. Grandma even tried to salvage her underperforming post by taking a screencap of it and posting it as her header image, which really hammers home just how much help she needs engaging her audience. A simple, digestible, heartfelt post such as, “The love of my life died today after 68 years of marriage. My heart is broken but also full with wonderful memories of our years together,” in her main feed would’ve undoubtedly attracted way more attention and spread the word of Grandpa’s passing more efficiently.  C’mon, Grandma. Grandpa deserved better than this.  The clock is ticking for Grandma to realize the error of her ways while Grandpa’s death is still fresh and get a post up that really does justice to a man who fought in the Korean war and raised seven kids on a farmer’s income. This isn’t a post about baking a batch of gingerbread cookies or a trip to Branson here, Grandma. This is Grandpa’s life. Let’s get it together and give him the memorial post that will get those Likes and Shares up to respectable numbers fitting for a great man like Grandpa."
Did Sesame Street Go Too Far When They Revealed Big Bird Has Been Dating His Brother For 400 Years To Teach Kids That Incest Is Fine As Long As It’s Consensual And There’s No Reproduction?,N/A,https://clickhole.com/did-sesame-street-go-too-far-when-they-revealed-big-bird-has-been-dating-his-brother-for-400-years-to-teach-kids-that-incest-is-fine-as-long-as-its-consensual-and-theres-no-reproduct/,"Sesame Street has been a beloved children’s show for decades, but unfortunately, a recent episode has some fans wondering if the show crossed a line: Did Sesame Street go too far when they revealed Big Bird has been dating his brother for 400 years to teach kids that incest is fine as long as it’s consensual and there’s no reproduction? Yikes. While parents revere Sesame Street for its ability to entertain their kids while teaching them important life lessons, it seems like this might be a lesson parents don’t want their kids to learn. The recent controversial episode began with Big Bird announcing that he had someone he wanted the kids to meet, before a large bird who looks exactly like Big Bird, only with a mustache and beret instead, walked out and gave Big Bird a kiss on the cheek. “This is my beautiful and supportive brother, Tobias!” explained Big Bird as he gave his brother a slap on his rotund, feathered backside. “Does anyone know what today’s lesson will be about?” asked Big Bird, to which a child guessed, “Brothers?” “Even better,” responded Big Bird. “It’s about when brothers aren’t just brothers—they’re lovers too!”  “Dating is difficult because in order to do it, you have to go out and meet someone,” continued Big Bird. “Dating your sibling is a great solution to that problem, but there are some ground rules.” Big Bird was then joined by Elmo as they proceeded to describe the “ABCs of Incest,” which are “Avoid reproduction,” “Bring you joy,” and “Constantly confirm consent!” As Big Bird explained, without following these ABCs, you can’t expect your incestuous relationship to last 400 years like his has. Wow. While consensual incestuous relationships certainly do happen in the world, perhaps it is best that no one learns that while they’re also learning how to spell. Although angry parents have flooded HBO’s social media with tweets calling out the scene in which Big Bird and his brother Tobias show the kids dozens of photo albums cataloging their hundreds of romantic summers spent vacationing at a cottage on Martha’s Vineyard, HBO has defended it, saying that it proves how fulfilling an incestuous relationship can be. That particular scene ends as Big Bird shows a child a photo of him and his brother shucking clams together and says, “How can someone look at a relationship this positive and say that it’s wrong?” The episode then cuts to a shot of Big Bird walking hand-in-hand with his brother down Sesame Street at sunset, with the street lamps emitting a soft, gentle light. He and his brother share a tender kiss, and Big Bird turns to the camera and says, “Remember kids, you can’t take the relationship with your sibling to the next level unless there’s consent.” Big Bird then looks at his brother and adds, “Plus—with incest, you never have to deal with a dreaded monster-in-law!” before snickering into Tobias’s shoulder, as though what he just said was somehow an inside joke for them. What do you think? Should HBO reconsider their stance and take down this episode? Sound off in the comments about whether or not you think it’s appropriate for Sesame Street to address incest!"
‘Respect My Authoritahhh!’: Mark Zuckerberg Is Using One Of The FedEx Office Store’s Computers That Charges Per Minute To Watch ‘A Bug’s Life’,N/A,https://clickhole.com/respect-my-authoritahhh-mark-zuckerberg-is-using-one-of-the-fedex-office-stores-computers-that-charges-per-minute-to-watch-a-bugs-life/,"We all know that power corrupts, so it should come as no surprise that one major tech CEO is currently wielding his authority in a truly uncouth way: Mark Zuckerberg is using one of the FedEx Office store’s computers that charges per minute to watch A Bug’s Life. Wow! Zuck is really throwing his weight around! This situation is currently playing out in a downtown Palo Alto FedEx Office location, where the Meta CEO has been sitting on an uncomfortable wooden stool for the past 45 minutes as he uses an illegal site called SeeMovie.com to watch the animated comedy A Bug’s Life on a computer that is currently charging his credit card at a rate of 44 cents per minute. Early on in the process, a store employee approached Zuckerberg to let him know about the high cost of using the FedEx Office computers for anything but a simple printing job, but Zuckerberg merely stood up and said, “Use the computers? Bitch, I’m the CEO of computers! And you will respect my authoritah!!!” After that, he resumed watching the film, but began to pause periodically so that he could take screenshots of the grasshopper played by Kevin Spacey, then print dozens of copies of said screenshots on glossy photo paper, all while shouting “Whateva, whateva, I do what I want!” to no one in particular. He really does do what he wants, it seems! After a second employee came up to Zuckerberg to let him know that he had run up an approximate bill of $350, the tech billionaire took out both his health insurance card and a Meta employee badge and shrieked “RESPECT MY AUTHORITAH” once more. He then dramatically re-started A Bug’s Life from the beginning, cranked the volume to max, took a selfie of himself watching it, transferred that selfie to a FedEx Office flash drive, and approached the counter to demand to have it printed in the form of a $30 spiral bound photo calendar. Since then, Zuckerberg has spent most of his time convulsing in laughter at the fat caterpillar in A Bug’s Life, though every time another customer enters the store he takes a moment to stand up and say “I own the internet, I own the computers, I own the printers, I own the bugs! Everybody knows to respect my authoritah!” Yikes. The man is out of control! The fact that no one has managed to stop Zuckerberg’s frivolous antics shows just how absolute his power has become in Silicon Valley. But, hey, we guess you don’t get to one million friends without making a few enemies. Respect his authoritah!"
Not Their Best Work: PETA Just Liberated 5 Pig Fetuses From A High School Dissection Lab And Released Them Into A Retention Pond,N/A,https://clickhole.com/not-their-best-work-peta-just-liberated-5-pig-fetuses-from-a-high-school-dissection-lab-and-released-them-into-a-retention-pond/,"We all have our off days, but a recent showing from one of America’s most high-profile animal rights groups is hard to defend as anything but a big swing and a miss: PETA just liberated five pig fetuses from a high school dissection lab and released them into a retention pond. Yeesh, they definitely came up short with this one. Whatever your opinion on the positions and tactics of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, it seems fair to say that a number of their past actions have undeniably helped animals escape some pretty fucked up situations, but sadly they failed to live up to those prior successes yesterday when three undercover activists infiltrated Weston High School disguised as janitors to spring several dissection-bound pig fetuses from the premises. The PETA operatives waited until a mandatory 10th grade assembly to slip into the science labs unnoticed, and once there they worked swiftly to load five pig fetuses into a secret compartment hidden within a specially constructed shop vacuum to avoid raising suspicion. They then rappelled out a second-floor window mere minutes before the fetal pigs would have been cut open as part of the biology curriculum’s unit on anatomy, and finally capped the mission off by releasing the fetuses into a small retention pond a few miles down the road and announcing their success on social media. While a lot of planning clearly went into this operation, it’s hard to deny that the execution left a lot to be desired. For starters, one of the liberated pig fetuses was quickly pulled under by a big snapping turtle after being released into the retention pond, while another got carried off by a German Shepherd being walked off-leash minutes later. So at best only three of the pig fetuses got happy endings, and that’s pretty generously assuming that an uncertain future in a pool of stagnant water is for sure a “happy” thing for them at all. There’s also the fact that they only liberated five of a total 82 pig fetuses slated for dissection that day, which means that they didn’t so much stop the dissections outright as make a handful of students do their dissections in groups of three instead of pairs. And the operatives also ran over not one, but two little squirrels on the brief drive from the high school to the retention pond, so even taking PETA at their word that rescuing five preserved pig fetuses was worthwhile in the first place, it still undeniably came at the expense of other animal life. It’s a far cry from their work on the Silver Springs monkey case, that’s for sure. PETA is trying to do some victory laps on social media by posting pictures of happy piglets frolicking in sunny grass, but it rings pretty hollow given that these are obviously just stock photos and not the actual pig fetuses they freed from the school. Of course this doesn’t diminish the genuinely laudable work PETA’s done exposing and ending horrifying violations of animal welfare in the past, but reputation-wise, they’re gonna have to have to pull something like bringing down a puppy mill that tortures a couple dozen corgis to death per day to wash off the stink from this flop. Man, PETA really dropped the ball on this one. No offense to the pig fetuses, but here’s hoping these activists do something a little more impressive for their next big undercover operation! "
Body Positivity FTW! This Flounder Doesn’t Give Two Shits That Its Body Is All Flat And Weird And Sideways And Shit,N/A,https://clickhole.com/body-positivity-ftw-this-flounder-doesnt-give-two-shits-that-its-body-is-all-flat-and-weird-and-sideways-and-shit/,"Even after years of the body positivity movement, our society is still plagued by massively unrealistic beauty standards that leave many with low self-esteem and feelings of inadequacy. But one incredible sea creature isn’t willing to let the world make her feel ashamed of her looks: This flounder doesn’t give two shits that her body is all flat and weird and sideways and shit. Hell yes! This is the kind of body positivity the world needs now more than ever! Look at the cover of your average fashion magazine and you won’t see many bodies like this flounder’s. Most of the so-called “sexy” models that we see on TV or online don’t look like a slimy cubist drawing of roadkill, but that doesn’t stop this flounder from flaunting her weird toupee-shaped body all over the ocean and showing off her glistening brown blob of a figure with total confidence like an absolute badass. Get it, girl!  You might think that after years seeing pictures of impossibly skinny Instagram celebrities with perfect skin and symmetrical faces, this flounder would spend all her time hiding in the mud at the bottom of the ocean. Instead, she’s out feeding every day on all the sea worms she wants, confidently flopping her flat body all over the sea like the girlboss she is. She’s not afraid to use her two freaky eyes that God decided to stick on the same side of her head as some sort of cruel joke to stare Western beauty standards right in the face and say, “No. I’m beautiful no matter what our media says.” She’s flat and sideways and weird and she couldn’t care less! This is officially the most inspiring thing you’re going to read all week. We can’t stop applauding this flounder for feeling sexy in her own amorphous pancake of a body. She’s living proof that you can be beautiful no matter what side of your head your strange bulging eyes are on. If more people had the same body positive attitude as this flounder, the world would be a better place!"
The Miracle Of Life: PornHub Has Announced That Every Creampie Video On Their Site Led To The Birth Of A Wonderful Child,N/A,https://clickhole.com/the-miracle-of-life-pornhub-has-announced-that-every-creampie-video-on-their-site-led-to-the-birth-of-a-wonderful-child/,"Sometimes it’s easy to forget just how extraordinary the act of procreation is, but one major company is doing everything they can to celebrate the miracle of life: PornHub just announced that every single creampie video on their site led to the birth of a wonderful child.  Beautiful! PornHub revealed in a press release today that, after exhaustively vetting all 193,398 creampie videos on their website, they can officially confirm that each and every hot clip of a massive cock unloading its sticky man batter into an eager fuckhole led to the birth of a healthy, adorable child approximately nine months later. The porn juggernaut even went as far as to follow up with the performers from each of the XXX videos to ensure that all of the resultant chubby-cheeked angels are being loved and supported by both of their parents, or in the case of gangbangs, the mother and every guy who filled her snatch ‘til it was overflowing. “Watching a closeup of a creampie oozing out of a well-used, satisfied pussy is great and all, but only if it can be confirmed that the sperm did indeed spark the life of a wonderful newborn infant,” said PornHub in the press release. “The last thing we want is for PornHub viewers to have to imagine that the massive loads of jizz didn’t successfully impregnate the actress as she screamed, ‘Give me your cum, Daddy!’ or, ‘Fill me up, I need it!’ How disappointing would that be? PornHub is not only a place for viewers to explore their wildest creampie fantasies, but also a place where viewers can celebrate the sanctity of life and take comfort knowing that the filthy sex acts they’re watching aren’t in vain.” “Yes, of course I get pregnant and give birth after every scene I shoot,” said pornographic actress Creampie Cathy. “Why else would I do it? Sure, feeling the warm creampie filling me up and then getting slurped out of me by another woman is fun, but that’s just a bonus. I do this because I love children. They truly are our future. So when PornHub told me they would take my videos down if I couldn’t provide DNA test results showing that every video I’ve done led to the birth of a child, I had no problem doing it.” Amazing. Your move, XVideos.com! There are things more important in life than masturbating to raunchy pornography, and by ensuring that all their hardcore creampie porn leads to beautiful children being born, PornHub is reminding us of what truly matters. Way to go, PornHub! "
Gonna Be A Long Trip: Nobody On This Ghost Ship’s Eternal Voyage Of The Damned Is Even Remotely Fuckable,N/A,https://clickhole.com/gonna-be-a-long-trip-nobody-on-this-ghost-ships-eternal-voyage-of-the-damned-is-even-remotely-fuckable/,"It looks like unending perdition is shaping up to be even duller than we expected, because the hookup prospects of our new situation are some of the bleakest we’ve ever seen: Nobody on this ghost ship’s eternal voyage of the damned is even remotely fuckable. Oof, wish we’d known that before being cursed to forever wander the seas with them. We’d hoped we could take a bit of the edge off our everlasting servitude aboard the ghostly HMS Acheron with the occasional roll in the hay, but having finally gotten a good look at our fellow damned crewmen we’re sad to say that there doesn’t appear to be a single ‘would’ in the bunch. Even at our trashiest, most desperate low, there’s not one condemned soul here we could bring ourselves to lock tongues with in some tucked-away corner of the spectral vessel’s hold. You’d think at least a couple of hotties would have signed away their immortal souls to this demon frigate somewhere along the line since it foundered off the coast of Gibraltar in 1734, but nope, all the ill-fated mariners it’s taken in those intervening centuries have been busted as hell down to the last bug-eyed topman clambering his scurvied ass up the mizzenmast. We promise this isn’t just us having unattainably high standards, either—even the most charitable appraisal would have to concede that the hotness levels here are fucking dire. The bosun’s mate is probably the closest of these schlubs come to fuckability, and he still looks like a composite image of Boris Johnson and a foot. The rest of the crewmen are an underwhelming hodgepodge of scabby, emaciated 2s and 3s, each somehow less fuckable than the last, and the queasy green glow of the unearthly hellfire that rings the Acheron’s sails definitely isn’t doing their complexions any favors either. The captain at least has some nice definition to his arms, and under slightly different circumstances we could maybe see ourselves going for it, but sadly he had his head blown off by a French gunboat’s cannonade as part of his eternal punishment for having forsaken God’s grace, and headlessness is a huge deal-breaker for us in assessing a potential lay. Man, so much for the endless limbo between life and death being any fun. Things are so bad that we’ve actually found ourselves looking forward to when the light of the full moon reveals the crew’s skeletal true forms, because even a straight-up skeleton is easier on the eyes than these leering homunculi in daylight. Pretty much our only hope for getting laid at this point is for someone with a halfway decent face and body to drown at the stroke of midnight without having ever been baptized so their doomed soul becomes forever bound to phantom HMS Acheron, but having seen the kind of low-quality wraiths this ghost ship attracts normally, let’s just say we aren’t holding our breath. Welp, guess it’s back to jacking off for the foreseeable future. Here’s hoping there’s some kind of loophole that lets us escape the Acheron’s curse early, because aimlessly sailing the seas with these losers until the day of God’s final judgment is not something we’re looking forward to!"
A Living Legend In Their Midst: None Of This Man’s Friends Or Family Know He Made The Highest Rated Tab For ‘Black Hole Sun’ On Ultimate-Guitar.com,N/A,https://clickhole.com/a-living-legend-in-their-midst-none-of-this-mans-friends-or-family-know-he-made-the-highest-rated-tab-for-black-hole-sun-on-ultimate-guitar-com/,"They say that with true greatness comes humility in equal measure. If anyone embodies such modesty, it’s Ron Beagen, 46, of Keansburg, New Jersey, who single-handedly accomplished an absolutely amazing feat without any need for attention or praise: None of this man’s friends or family know he’s the mind behind the highest rated tab for “Black Hole Sun” on Ultimate-Guitar.com.  Amazing. If only this man’s acquaintances knew one of Ultimate-Guitar.com’s most reliable contributors was living quietly in their midst! Though he’s the brilliant mind who wrote out Ultimate-Guitar.com’s most popular tab for Soundgarden’s 1994 song “Black Hole Sun”, which is currently sitting at 4.5 stars, Ron Beagan has opted to keep this achievement to himself and instead live a quiet, humble life as if he were just any regular Joe, working as a medical billing clerk by day and crafting highly accurate guitar tabs for 90s rock songs by night. Yup, not a soul in Ron’s unassuming suburban existence—not his friends, coworkers, or even his own wife and kids—is even remotely aware that he single-handedly figured out the alternate tuning Soundgarden used for the song, making his tab is the only one that sounds right when you play it. Compared to the other tabs for “Black Hole Sun,” most of which are just guesswork chord progressions copy-and-pasted above the Chris Cornell’s lyrics, Ron’s tab spells out both rhythm and lead guitar parts down to the exact notes, slides, hammer-ons, and effects pedals used throughout the song, proving himself to be an absolute master of the craft. What’s even more mind-blowing is that Ron just uploaded his work to Ultimate Guitar’s site for free. Over the years, thousands of amateur guitar players across the world have learned to play “Black Hole Sun” by using his tab and heeding his advice for using chorus and echo effects to match Kim Thayil’s specific guitar tone, and Ron hasn’t sought a single dime or any public credit in return.  While creating the go-to Ultimate-Guitar.com tab for Soundgarden’s biggest hit would be the greatest feat of most people’s entire lifetimes, Ron treats playing guitar and writing tabs as a simple hobby he does whenever he has free time on weekends, instead of the divine calling it clearly is for him. Odds are, the reason Ron isn’t racing to tell everyone his life about this massive achievement is because if everyone knew he was behind the “Black Hole Sun” tab favorited by over 40k Ultimate Guitar users, they’d start treating him differently, and that fame would change his life for the worse. Nope, Ron’s perfectly satisfied just knowing he’s made an impact on fellow Soundgarden fans who want to learn how to play grunge classics themselves. Wow. To think that this man’s own family is completely unaware they’re living under the same roof as a living legend…simply astonishing.  Not since Jonas Salk opted to make the polio vaccine free for the public instead of patenting it has such a selfless, influential soul walked this earth. Hopefully Ron gets his due someday, because he’s certainly earned it. Rock on, Ron!"
The Saga Continues: JK Rowling Just Revealed That Dumbledore Actually Isn’t Gay And She Would Know Because She Gave Him A Handjob Once And He Was Def Into It,N/A,https://clickhole.com/the-saga-continues-jk-rowling-just-revealed-that-dumbledore-actually-isnt-gay-and-she-would-know-because-she-gave-him-a-handjob-once-and-he-was-def-into-it/,"Although it’s been more than two decades since the first Harry Potter book debuted, the author the series continues to delight readers with frequent revelations about the characters’ lives, and her latest update is no exception: JK Rowling just revealed that Dumbledore actually isn’t gay and she would know because she gave him a handjob once and he was def into it. Amazing! Being a Harry Potter fan is truly the gift that keeps on giving! The author took to Twitter to share the exciting new information earlier this week:  Wow! Thanks to JK Rowling for such a fascinating update about a beloved character! What incredible surprises will the Wizarding World have for us next?"
Heartwarming: The Make-A-Wish Foundation Was Getting A Little Backed Up So They Just Dumped A Big Barrel Of Change On The Floor In The Hallway Of A Children’s Cancer Ward,N/A,https://clickhole.com/heartwarming-the-make-a-wish-foundation-was-getting-a-little-backed-up-so-they-just-dumped-a-big-barrel-of-change-on-the-floor-in-the-hallway-of-a-childrens-cancer-ward/,"In over 40 years of operation, the Make-A-Wish Foundation has brought hope to hundreds of thousands of sick children by making their wishes come true, and even when faced with challenges, it appears the organization isn’t slowing down any time soon: The Make-A-Wish Foundation was getting a little backed up, so they just dumped a big barrel of change on the floor in the hallway of a children’s cancer ward. What a beautiful story! It’s so wonderful that the Make-A-Wish Foundation is able to make the world a brighter place for sick kids even when their schedule is packed. Yesterday afternoon, kids at the Children’s Hospital Los Angeles in California got the thrill of their young lives when three middle-aged men walked into the hallway of the cancer ward carrying three burlap sacks with the Make-A-Wish Foundation’s logo on them filled with hundreds of pennies, nickels, and dimes. The men then wordlessly dumped the change out of the burlap bags and onto the floor for the sick kids to grab! The Make-A-Wish representatives were in and out of the hospital in just five minutes, saving them lots of time and energy while also brightening the kids’ day. As if dumping change on the floor wasn’t incredible enough, the representatives from Make-A-Wish also taped a picture of beloved actor John Cena on the wall so that the kids could look at his face while they stuffed their hospital gowns full of loose change. The John Cena picture was printed from the internet at the Make-A-Wish offices and the organization’s representatives added a speech bubble to the picture that said, “I’m Cena. Get healthy.” Any kid who read that speech bubble while picking up change would feel like they were talking to the real John Cena! And the best part is, it saved a huge amount of time and allowed the Make-A-Wish Foundation to catch up on their grueling schedule. Absolutely amazing! It’s so wonderful to know that no matter how dark and depressing the world might get, there are beacons of light in the world like the Make-A-Wish Foundation that find ways to brighten the lives of sick children in all sorts of efficient, time-saving ways. Things might be difficult for many of these children, but now they have pockets full of nickels and dimes and happy memories of seeing a picture of John Cena that they can turn to for comfort at any time. Here’s hoping the Make-A-Wish Foundation keeps finding awesome ways to catch up on their hectic schedule while giving sick kids all over the world a reason to smile!"
Does He Think It’s A Time Capsule? President Biden Has Placed A Letter To His Future Self Inside The Nuclear Football,N/A,https://clickhole.com/does-he-think-its-a-time-capsule-president-biden-has-placed-a-letter-to-his-future-self-inside-the-nuclear-football/,"“Nuclear football” is the nickname for the briefcase containing essential information to be used by the president in the event that a nuclear attack occurs while he is away from command centers, and while this is more or less common knowledge, it seems like it might not be so obvious to the one guy who needs to know about it most: President Biden has placed a letter to his future self inside the nuclear football. Uh oh. Does he think it’s a time capsule or something?  Earlier today, after boarding Air Force One, President Biden was reportedly seen slipping an envelope labeled “DO NOT OPEN UNTIL 2033” into the nuclear football which was sitting at the feet of a military aide who was also on the flight. The envelope was immediately removed from the briefcase and examined by military personnel who suspected it would have information regarding the nuclear plans. However, the letter, addressed to “Future Joe” contained no commands intended for a hypothetical future nuclear attack, but rather, appeared to be merely a letter that the president had written to himself as a way to capture the essence of his life in the year 2023.  A copy of the letter appears below: Dear Future Joe Biden, Greetings from the past! It’s currently January 2023, and I hope that by the time you’re reading this, you’re the president of the United States. PSYCH! You already did that!!!! I’m president right now! Are ya still married to the old ball and chain? If not, I trust that you did what was right. Not everything is meant to last, but I know you’ll handle whatever happens with grace and courage. A century from now is a long time, but I hope, above all, that you’re staying true to your heart. You’ve always marched to the beat of your own drummer. You zag when they say zig, and zig when they don’t say anything. And sure, you might love too much and fall too hard, but you’re a renegade, Joe Biden. Never let that fire inside you burn out. Dam, I got deep! I hope you’ve also had a ton of fun and spent plenty of time kicking back watching Hulu on the couch! I’ve included a couple mementos from the present to jog your memory of the person you once were. Included you’ll find a Pinkberry punch card to remind you of your favorite dessert, a glue stick to remind you of your favorite type of glue, and a USB drive containing Adele’s “Hello” to remind you of your current favorite song! Also, if the technology exists for you to send a letter back to me—PLEASE DO! I promise I won’t get all spooked out, either! All I ask is that you mention the code word “JOE BIDEN” at some point in your message so I don’t get duped by any imposters!  I’ll leave you with this: Promise me that you’ll take time for yourself and take breaks when your body needs them, as you’ve always struggled with overtraining at the gym.  With love, Past Joe Biden Oh, Joe… this is embarrassing. Is anyone gonna tell him that the nuclear football is not a time capsule?  Woof. Looks like Joe Biden spent a lot of time on that letter, but the nuclear football just isn’t meant to house keepsakes from the past. It’s a briefcase full of important documents. Still, we do hope that someone helps President Biden get the letter into a real time capsule sometime soon, because it was clearly written straight from the heart!"
"A Strong Feminist Man: This Guy Is Not Embarrassed To Buy Tampons For His Girlfriend, His Aunt, His Neighbors, His State Senator, Or Any Of His Favorite Actresses",N/A,https://clickhole.com/a-strong-feminist-man-this-guy-is-not-embarrassed-to-buy-tampons-for-his-girlfriend-his-aunt-his-neighbors-his-state-senator-or-any-of-his-favorite-actresses/,"Menstruation can be a sensitive topic, but real, strong men aren’t afraid to face it head on, which is why we are so impressed with the story of this awesome feminist ally: This guy is not embarrassed to buy tampons for his girlfriend, his aunt, his neighbors, his state senator, or any of his favorite actresses. Yes! This is what a good man looks like! Ben Lomond of Shaker Heights, Ohio may be a dude, but he certainly isn’t afraid of the feminine hygiene aisle in the drugstore. To the contrary, Ben personally spends upwards of $900 a month buying tampons for every female acquaintance he can think of, from his girlfriend Sarah on up to his district’s representative in the Ohio legislature. Rather than bashfully burying a single box of Tampax under the rest of his purchases and hightailing it to self-checkout, Ben fills an entire cart with feminine products of various styles and absorbencies, then approaches the CVS cashier to let them know that he’s printed 15 different tampon coupons and would also like help transporting his purchases to his car. And when he’s done, Ben has no qualms showing up to the UPS store and asking them to address one of their largest shipping boxes to Mila Kunis’ and Anna Gunn’s addresses in Los Angeles, proudly announcing that it’s “that time of the month” for two of his favorite Hollywood stars. It’s actually sad to think that there are still guys out there who wouldn’t be caught dead buying some pantyliners for their wives or girlfriends, especially compared to the high bar Ben has set. It’s clear he feels zero shame when he empties six boxes of super-plus tampons into a birdbath he put in the center of his cul-de-sac with the sign “Ben’s Free Tampon Pickup,” because he totally understands that guys who really care about the women in their communities don’t ignore their menstrual health. Ben will hand a loose overnight pad to his mail carrier or tip his bartender with a single Tampax Sport without thinking twice, because that’s just the kind of feminist he is. We’d love to see more men start conversations about their favorite way to determine whether a woman they’ve just met prefers plastic or cardboard applicators the way Ben does. He is seriously killing it. Yep, Ben Lomond is pretty much our feminist idol right now. He is tackling menstrual health in a way most other men are scared to, and we think that’s proof positive he’s a strong male role model for the ages. Keep buying tampons, Ben! You rock!"
"Heartwarming! When A 30-Foot-Long, 4-Ton Boy Washed Up On The Beach, This Community Worked Together To Return It To The Ocean",N/A,https://clickhole.com/heartwarming-when-a-30-foot-long-4-ton-boy-washed-up-on-the-beach-this-community-worked-together-to-return-it-to-the-ocean/,"The world may seem like a dark and scary place right now, but the people in one town on the coast of Maine just did something wonderful that proves that there’s still hope for humanity. When a 30-foot-long, four-ton boy washed up on the beach, this community worked together to return it to the ocean. Beautiful! This past Thursday started out just like any other for the people of Cape Elizabeth, Maine, until a local mail carrier named Martin Barlow spotted a massive form on the beach which, on closer inspection, he realized was a 30-foot-long little boy who had been left stranded on the sand and was struggling in vain to get back into the ocean. Martin immediately sprinted onto the beach and started calling for help to get the four-ton boy back into the water. “I saw that huge kid and thought, There’s no way a boy that massive is going to be able to get himself back into the ocean. I have to help him,” says Martin. “In this community, we consider it our responsibility to protect the sea and the creatures who live in it, and when a nine-year-old child the size of an 18-wheeler gets washed out of the ocean, you better believe we’re going to do everything we can to save him.” Martin knew he couldn’t move such an enormous boy by himself. He also knew that if he didn’t get the boy back into the ocean, authorities would have to blow him up with dynamite before the seagulls started eating his body. This was an ecological emergency that one person couldn’t solve alone. Fortunately, within moments, Martin was joined by dozens of community members who all started pushing the enormous boy back into the sea. Soon there were over 100 people on the beach working to rescue the boy and offering suggestions on the best way to get his colossal frame back into the ocean. Faith in humanity restored! It was truly inspiring watching so many people volunteering to help, from truck drivers offering their vehicles, to nurses monitoring the boy’s 600-pound heart to make sure his vitals didn’t plunge, to the group of barbers from a nearby barbershop who climbed on top of the boy to give him a bowl cut while the rescue team worked together to get him back into the ocean. According to witnesses, the boy, wearing nothing but swim trunks and goggles, got stuck on the beach after wandering too close to the shore to beg local fishermen to throw hamburgers into the water for him. Experts say that had the boy been stranded on the beach for more than a few hours, he would have been done for. But Martin and his fellow residents of Cape Elizabeth weren’t about to let that happen.  As they pushed the boy across the sand, he screamed things like, “I’m hungry!” and “I’m bored!” The sounds of his distress were heartbreaking, but they inspired everyone to work even harder to rescue him. By the early afternoon, the boy was back in the water and swimming happily back home, all thanks to the power of teamwork. Wow! It doesn’t get any more heartwarming than this. The people of Cape Elizabeth deserve a round of applause for saving this enormous boy and returning him to his natural habitat. If more people were willing to come together as a community to do some good like them, the world would undoubtedly be a better place!"
"Body Positivity FTW: Everyone Involved In The Production Of These Green Bay Packers Cupcakes, From The Farmer Who Grew The Ingredients To The Woman Who Frosted Them To The Teenager Who Put Them On The Shelf, Was Incredibly Overweight ",N/A,https://clickhole.com/body-positivity-ftw-everyone-involved-in-the-production-of-these-green-bay-packers-cupcakes-from-the-farmer-who-grew-the-ingredients-to-the-woman-who-frosted-them-to-the-teenager-who-put-them-on-the/,"Society has made some serious strides in recent years towards embracing body positivity, and here’s yet another encouraging story that proves just how much our standards of beauty have evolved: Everyone involved in the production of these Green Bay Packers cupcakes, from the farmer who grew the ingredients to the woman who frosted them to the teenager who put them on the shelf, was incredibly overweight. Beautiful! This heartening saga of body acceptance began months ago, when a farmer pushing 400 pounds proudly cut and threshed the wheat used to make the cupcakes’ batter as his delightfully plump belly rested on the steering wheel of his combine. He then squeezed his way through the door of his chicken coop to collect the eggs for the delectable baked goods using a long handled scoop to save himself from trying to bend over, proudly flaunting his curvy figure in defiance of society’s ridiculous obsession with skinniness. From there, the grain and produce were loaded into an 18-wheeler with a size XXXL trucker at the helm who drove the goods from Kansas to Wisconsin while unabashedly chugging Mountain Dew and eating multiple gas station pizzas, making crucial contributions to this cupcake-production journey despite not having toned arms or a size-zero waist. The cupcake ingredients then made their way to a commercial bakery, where through the entire process of being mixed into batter, baked, and frosted, they were never once handled by anyone who came even close to meeting the WHO’s offensively non-inclusive recommended body mass index range. They were then placed on the shelf of a Festival Foods in Janesville, Wisconsin by a hard-working and capable 16-year-old stocker who, despite his young age, was already tipping the scales at around 250 pounds (and looking fabulous!). Finally, they were purchased by a 230-pound elderly woman who ended up eating the entire package well before Sunday’s season-ending Packers game.  Awesome. This, folks, is what the future of inclusivity looks like! Clearly, we have a long way to go before our society finally sees all body types as equal, but things are getting better all the time. Look no further than these Green Bay Packers cupcakes next time you want to be reminded that the world is becoming a more body positive place by the day."
Shameless Clout Chasing: This Honeybee Is Pretty Clearly Only Helping Guide A Blind Ox Through A Perilous Swamp So Someone Will Write A Fable About Her,N/A,https://clickhole.com/shameless-clout-chasing-this-honeybee-is-pretty-clearly-only-helping-guide-a-blind-ox-through-a-perilous-swamp-so-someone-will-write-a-fable-about-her/,"It sucks to see a good deed cheapened by ulterior motives, but sadly one supposed good Samaritan has made it painfully obvious that they’re only being charitable out of naked self-interest: This honeybee is pretty clearly only helping guide a blind ox through a perilous swamp so someone will write a fable about her. Ugh, this kind of calculating bullshit really leaves a bad taste in your mouth. We’ll admit, we were downright charmed when we first heard that a benevolent honeybee who got separated from her hive in a storm had offered to help a blind ox navigate a dark and treacherous swamp so they could both reach the tranquil meadow that lay beyond it. It seemed beautiful to see two creatures so different work together toward a common goal of finding a great big meadow with tasty grass and lots of wildflowers, and the blind ox choosing to trust the honeybee even though she buzzed like the mean flies that loved to harass the ox felt like a particularly urgent testament to the importance of overcoming prejudice. But on closer inspection we’ve come to the regrettable conclusion that this story is indeed too good to be true, because the honeybee is almost certainly doing all this just to boost her own profile with a spot in somebody’s allegorical moral lesson. Looking more carefully, there are a ton of red flags in the honeybee’s superficially altruistic behavior. For starters, her path through the swamp takes a number of lengthy, extraneous detours across especially hazardous sections of the mire, detours that serve no obvious purpose beyond dragging out the duration of their journey to give the honeybee a better chance of having her “good deed” noticed. The honeybee also got weirdly hostile when a passing stork offered to fly up high and point them toward the quickest route out of the swamp, telling him to “find your own imperiled ox” with the unsavory implication that his assistance would only steal her spotlight in any succinct, didactic tales about the adventure. And while we don’t have a concrete paper trail to prove anything conclusively, we actually overheard the mean flies talking later about how someone had paid them off to harass the blind ox in the first place—that detail would be fishy enough on its own, but it gets full-on sinister when you learn that whoever paid them did so in honey. Man, we feel gross for having ever thought this was a good allegory for cooperation’s power to overcome adversity! Of course the blind ox bears no blame for just wanting someone to help him avoid deep puddles of mud and thick patches of thorny brambles on his way to the meadow, but the honeybee using his predicament for her own personal gain feels undeniably fucked up and exploitative. It genuinely bothers us to realize how much of their uplifting, improbable journey was contrived by the honeybee to play on our emotions. Hell, even if some well-meaning contemporary Aesop ultimately does take the bait, we wouldn’t be surprised if this self-serving little apian egotist ends up wigging out on them anyway for calling their fable “The Ox and the Honeybee” instead of “The Honeybee and the Ox.” Damn, we guess some sickos out there really only care about looking out for number one. It seems like the only moral here is to watch out for fake-ass clout chasers feigning compassion to fuel their own egos! "
Some Brawn To Balance Out The Brains: Home Depot Has Been Added To The Ivy League,N/A,https://clickhole.com/some-brawn-to-balance-out-the-brains-home-depot-has-been-added-to-the-ivy-league/,"Exciting things are afoot in the world of academia, because one of America’s most elite institutions of scholarship just got balanced out with a dose of raw power: Home Depot has been added to the Ivy League. Whoa, looks like Home Depot is moving in some pretty rarefied circles these days! For years, the title “Ivy League” has conjured up images of dusty old libraries and spectacled, tweed-clad professors, but with their formal induction of Home Depot today, you’ll have to start picturing a couple burly, orange-aproned workers loading lumber into a truck bed as well. While Home Depot has always been a big name in the home improvement world, getting to join such a prestigious conference of universities gives them an undeniable reputation boost over competitors like Lowe’s and Ace Hardware. And the 8 original Ivies get some pretty good mileage out of their newly minted peers too, because now anytime someone tries to knock Ivy Leaguers for being a dweeby bunch of pencil-necked nerds, they can simply point to a musclebound Home Depot employee effortlessly lugging refrigerators around as evidence to the contrary. As unexpected as the move might be, we can’t deny that the Ivy League feels much more well-rounded with Home Depot in the mix to temper their dorkier inclinations. Of course there’s nothing wrong with the Ivy League having some eggheads who can identify new subatomic particles or analyze ancient epics like the Mahābhārata in their original Sanskrit, but it definitely does help us take them a bit more seriously now that they’ve got people who can work a table saw or hang a kitchen cabinet. Even the brainiest little Dartmouth twerp knows there’s only so much you can do with booksmarts alone. And if any of these highfalutin, blueblood Poindexters are slow to accept their new, more DIY-oriented colleagues, we bet they’ll change their tune after a strapping Home Depot alum helps them fix a malfunctioning grill at the tailgate for the big Yale-Home Depot football game. Honestly, this seems like it’ll be a pretty good arrangement for everyone involved. It’s wild to think that we’re going to start seeing some Ivy Leaguers who can build an honest-to-God deck with their own two callused hands instead of just programming some kind of robot to build it for them, but it makes sense that the head honchos in charge of the Ivies would want to shore up their relative weakness in the more physical pursuits. However good some bookish ivory-tower brainiac might be at thinking up their fancy-pants theories and dissertations, sometimes it still takes a big lunk with core strength and a willingness to get their hands dirty to actually put those ideas into practice, and as of today the Ivy League’s finally got all their bases covered. Wow, the Ivy League definitely feels like a more complete package now they’ve added Home Depot to their ranks. Here’s looking forward to seeing what they can do with this potent combo of muscle and mind! "

Yup, he is 100 percent going to put his penis in it the very first chance he gets.   Upon receiving the sex toy, 28-year-old Jeffrey Aletta acted scandalized and embarrassed, but little did the friend who got it for him know just how hard he knocked it out of the park. “Haha, you guys are too much, what am I even supposed to do with this?” laughed Aletta, neglecting to disclose just how much of a blessing the fleshlight would be to him in his personal life, having strongly considered buying one for himself on multiple occasions in the past but having always held back out of shame.  “Like, how the heck does this thing work?” he continued, knowing deep down exactly how it works but pretending otherwise so as not to seem like the kind of person who would ever consider fucking a fleshlight, even though that’s exactly what he’s going to do the second the final party guest leaves. “Seriously, what an insane gift, Ryan, you’re twisted for this one—thanks, I guess? Haha.” Aletta then opened up the sex toy’s highly explicit instruction manual and feigned confusion at its contents while secretly internalizing them to aid in his masturbatory endeavors later on in the evening.   “Apparently the silicone is ‘molded from Riley Reid’s vagina?’ Is she, like, a porn star or something?,” asked Jeffrey, completely aware of pornographic actress Riley Reid and much of her work. He then made a joke about how he could perhaps repurpose it as a vase or something or even regift it to his parents, strategically downplaying his keen interest in the synthetic genital device that will in the coming weeks receive well over a pint of his ejaculations.  “Hey, anyone wanna trade gifts? Haha,” joked Jeffrey to further establish his disinterest while actually hoping with all of his heart that no one took him up on the offer and wrested away his free ticket to non-stop onanistic pleasure. “No? Okay, guess I’m stuck with this thing.” He then discreetly hid the fleshlight behind a throw pillow so people would forget about it and not try to take it from him, counting down the minutes until the party ended so he could lock himself in his bedroom, get down on his knees, and ravenously eat out the Pocket Pussy while drooling all over his chin and chest.  Sounds like he is extremely horny! Raunchy gift aside, it’s times like these with friends and loved ones that make the holidays so special. And if Aletta can successfully hang onto the fleshlight for the remainder of the party, then it sounds like he’s gonna have himself the best Christmas ever. "
Looks Like The Cowboys Lost Again: Dad Has Been Locked In His Room Blasting ‘Chasing Cars’ By Snow Patrol And Moaning For The Last 3 Days,N/A,https://clickhole.com/looks-like-the-cowboys-lost-again-dad-has-been-locked-in-his-room-blasting-chasing-cars-by-snow-patrol-and-moaning-for-the-last-3-days/,"Ever since Sunday afternoon, nobody’s heard from Dad which can only mean one thing: The Cowboy’s must’ve lost, because Dad has been locked in his room blasting “Chasing Cars” by Snow Patrol and moaning for the last three days. Oh, God. Here we go again. Even though Dad has witnessed a great many Cowboys losses over the years, he apparently still doesn’t know how to cope with it, as following the team’s overtime loss to the Jaguars on Sunday, Dad’s been playing Snow Patrol’s 2006 hit while loudly singing along through painful sobs. Because Dad doesn’t know how to use Spotify or Apple Music or anything like that, he’s just been watching the song’s music video on YouTube over and over on the crappy second generation iPad he won in a raffle, like, ten years ago, and at this point, he’s even melodramatically reciting the YouTube ads too. To make matters even worse, Dad has refused to unlock the door to let Mom inside the room, so Mom’s been sleeping on the couch all week and complaining nonstop about the resulting sciatica pain, making things considerably more annoying for the rest of us. And, maddeningly, Mom has only been enabling Dad’s whiny-ass behavior by leaving meals outside the door three times a day, even though she surely knows that if she didn’t bring Dad food, he’d only last in there, like, two hours tops before he’d have to leave the room to eat some snacks. God, this is so fucking annoying.  Hey, Dad? Not to be rude, but can you please just stop moping around and crying about football? You’re 65 years old. Plus, you’re the breadwinner, so you need to go make money for the family. Just pretend that the Cowboys won and put an end to this miserable bullshit already."
Going For It: Tampax Has Announced That They Are Going To Try To Be One Of Those Brands Everyone Associates With Christmas Like Macy’s Or Coca-Cola,N/A,https://clickhole.com/going-for-it-tampax-has-announced-that-they-are-going-to-try-to-be-one-of-those-brands-everyone-associates-with-christmas-like-macys-or-coca-cola/,"Between the Coca-Cola polar bears and the Macy’s tree lighting in Rockefeller Center, some brands just make people think of Christmas, and it looks like another company is aiming to make themselves a beloved fixture of the holiday season: Tampax has announced that they are going to try to be one of those brands everyone associates with Christmas. Okay, Tampax! Get it! In a press release earlier today, Tampax declared that by Christmas 2023, the brand name Tampax will be essentially synonymous with Christmas. “We are changing our branding entirely: From now on, our tampon boxes will be red with green trim, featuring depictions of happy families around their fireplaces, their mantles decorated with garlands made of tampons,” said Tampax. “Today’s children will grow up seeing commercials where Santa and Rudolph themselves pour out boxes of Tampax Pearl tampons in the yard for kids to make snow angels in, and our new jingle, ‘That Time Of The Month, That Time Of The Year,’ will drive home our message that Tampax is a brand for families to enjoy together over the holiday season.” Tampax also unveiled a new line of holiday tampons, which have a light fir tree scent and make a jingling sound when shaken. Additionally, they have planned for a Carol Of The Tampax night to take place in CVS parking lots around the country, where children dressed in winter garb will hold long, white tampon-shaped candles and sing traditional Christmas songs. And in a final bid to secure their place in the Christmas canon, the company has also devised a new mascot: a mid-30s version of Mrs. Claus who is always dealing with hormone-driven hot chocolate cravings and begging the elves to bring her a heating pad.  Wow!  As Christmas day draws near, it looks like Tampax is going to play a much bigger part in the holidays than ever before, and we are here for it. If Macy’s thinks they can corner the market on the holidays with just a few festive window displays, they’d better think again, because tampons are now a major part of Christmas. Happy holidays, all!"
Awesome! Kraft Is Introducing New Frank Sinatra-Shaped Mac & Cheese For Sheltered Kids With Really Old Parents,N/A,https://clickhole.com/awesome-kraft-is-introducing-new-frank-sinatra-shaped-mac-cheese-for-sheltered-kids-with-really-old-parents/,"If you’re a kid aged 10 or under with one or both parents in their 60s or 70s, get excited, because one of the world’s biggest food companies is aiming to make you feel seen: Kraft is introducing Frank Sinatra-shaped mac and cheese for sheltered kids with really old parents. Awesome! Finally, a fun food product with cultural references that won’t alienate kids raised on weird, campy media from the Jim Crow era. In a press release, Kraft revealed that the new Sinatra-shaped mac and cheese is meant to reach a demographic of children who feel isolated by the typical Spongebob- or Paw Patrol-themed macaroni pieces, having spent their childhoods in quiet, video game-free homes with parents who were born when Eisenhower was president and exclusively watch early-color shows on MeTV. Kraft explained that these culturally inept children—many of whom have the same side-part haircut as their dads, tuck their T-shirts into their pants, and aren’t allowed to eat any junk food besides the occasional root beer-flavored hard candy from the Cracker Barrel gift shop—deserve a fun dinner treat just as much as normal kids, or perhaps even more so considering how much fun they’ve been deprived over the years, receiving only boring Christmas gifts like heavy snow globes and wooden puzzle toys, and being endlessly subjected to their AARP-eligible parents’ mind-numbing Perry Como records and dumb Baby Boomer shows like Kolchak: The Night Stalker that fall woefully short of the thrills of present-day entertainment. “At Kraft, we believe all kids deserve to feel seen, and that means severely sheltered children too, who know more about Barney Fife than any Nickelodeon character, and whose siblings are all 10-plus years older than them because their frail parents decided to have one last child at an extremely, extremely late age,” said the press release, adding that, in focus groups, such children reacted much more positively to Frank Sinatra imagery than imagery related to Marvel films, popular YouTubers, or Peppa Pig. “The box alone will provide much-needed recreation for these under-socialized children, featuring a full-color image of friendly Old Blue Eyes himself on the front, and Gunsmoke-themed trivia questions on the back that they can use to test their aging parents’ mental acuity. With a little Sinatra in every bite of our signature cheesy goodness, eating quiet, 5:00 pm dinners with their retirement-age parents just got a lot more fun.” Wow!  Without a doubt, kids who live in musty, blue-carpeted homes filled with uncomfortable wooden furniture and spend all their free time silently drawing are absolutely going to love this Frank Sinatra mac and cheese. Why even bother forming friendships with kids your own age when your mac and cheese gives you all the companionship you need?"
"One Thing At A Time, Dude: This 3-Year-Old, Who Still Needs Help Wiping His Own Ass, Just Asked What Happens To Pets When They Die",N/A,https://clickhole.com/one-thing-at-a-time-dude-this-3-year-old-who-still-needs-help-wiping-his-own-ass-just-asked-what-happens-to-pets-when-they-die/,"There’s putting the cart before the horse, and then there’s being flat out oblivious. This is a prime example of the latter: This 3 year-old who still needs help wiping his own ass just asked what happens to pets when they die.  Yeah, listen, kid: What matters right now is you learning how to go to the bathroom by yourself like a normal person. Whether dogs have souls is a question that can absolutely wait. Earlier today, three-year-old Joshua Jacobson tried punching way above his intellectual weight class when he asked his parents “if doggies and kitties go to Heaven,” not five minutes after desperately screaming out for his mother to come help him on the potty. To be clear, the question of whether a living being’s consciousness continues to exist in some form after death is an undoubtedly engaging point of discussion, but not so much when it’s coming from a person who literally swallowed a bunch of change for absolutely no reason last week. As fascinating as it is to consider religious perspectives that may include or exclude animals in their conceptions of the afterlife—or, from an atheistic perspective, what happens to say, a dog’s corpse, as it physically decomposes—Joshua needs to concern himself with figuring out how to wipe his own butt, clean the globs of snot off his own chin, and refrain from sobbing every time his dad runs the vacuum cleaner before he can take on any of the deeper philosophical questions about the nature of life as we know it. If you’re still reluctant to use the toilet because you’re afraid you might fall into it, how about you pipe down with the existential queries, ‘kay? God, it must be so irritating to raise a child who somehow doesn’t understand how to use toilet paper, yet feels the need to start obnoxious conversations pretentious bullshit like this. Joshua seriously needs to stop asking unanswerable questions about life and death, and start learning how to clean the shit out of his ass, and quick."
"Finally, A Vegan Option: Best Buy Is Now Selling A Carrot",N/A,https://clickhole.com/finally-a-vegan-option-best-buy-is-now-selling-a-carrot/,"If you’re vegan, this is bound to be the most exciting news you’ll read all day, because a major company has finally stepped up and begun catering to those with meat-free diets: Best Buy is now selling a carrot.  Awesome!

The single carrot, priced at $0.99, marks the consumer electronics retailer’s first-ever offering targeted at vegan consumers, finally giving those with plant-based diets incentive to visit Best Buy stores. “Any vegetarian or vegan knows how awkward it is when your friends all want to go to Best Buy, and you have to say they don’t have any options for you,” the press release stated. “Those days are over. Whether you’re vegan, keto, gluten-free, or halal, Best Buy now has your needs in mind, and we’re hopeful that selling a carrot will help usher in a new generation of customers.” Amazing.  Well, this is a huge win for herbivores everywhere.

Well, this is simply delightful! The company announced in a press release that, moving forward, every single pair of glasses they sell will come equipped with a tiny scaffold suspended on two tiny cables, upon which will perch a tiny little ant in tiny ant overalls whose job is to keep the glasses’ lenses clean with his tiny ant squeegee. “Our customers will never again deal with cloudy glasses, because from now on a happy little ant will spend all day lugging his microscopic plastic bucket of cleaning fluid up and down each lens, whistling audibly as he works and pausing every so often to wipe sweat from his tiny brow,” said Warby Parker. “The ant may occasionally be noticeable in the glasses wearer’s field of vision, but we hope that this will serve to remind them of the great job he is doing buffing their lenses with his impossibly small microfiber cloth.” “The ant will take a break every day between noon and one to eat his lunch—some tree sap from a little metal pail,” the company added. “This is an important part of the ant’s contract and we ask that our customers respect his time while he dangles his minuscule legs over the scaffold and enjoys his food.” Wow, this is pretty stinkin’ adorable. We can’t wait to get our hands on some of these ant-equipped glasses!"
Legendary Night With The Boys: Religious Scholars Have Concluded That Visiting The Newborn Jesus Was Just One Stop On The Magi’s Wild All-Night Adoration Crawl,N/A,https://clickhole.com/legendary-night-with-the-boys-religious-scholars-have-concluded-that-visiting-the-newborn-jesus-was-just-one-stop-on-the-magis-wild-all-night-adoration-crawl/,"The world of Christian theology has been rocked by a recent discovery, as new information has revealed that a well-known biblical trio went even harder than was previously thought: Religious scholars have concluded that visiting the newborn Jesus was just one stop on the Magi’s wild all-night adoration crawl. Absolute madmen! So much pious veneration in a single night! Christian tradition has long held that Jesus Christ was visited after his birth by three reverential wise men from the east, but new findings have led theologians to believe that Christ was just one of no less than 16 stops on a raucous adoration crawl that took the Magi all over the greater Bethlehem area from dusk to dawn. The findings suggest the Magi had originally intended to just quietly adore a fig tree that had miraculously given fruit in a drought and call it a night, until the wise man Caspar suggested they follow up by adoring the immaculately conceived son of God he’d heard about a little ways down the road. The Magi quickly blew through the remaining gold, frankincense, and myrrh they had on them while adoring the Christ child, but it was only upon exiting the manger that Melchior gamely offered that, if they felt like it, he had enough gifts back at his hotel room for them to stay out genuflecting and giving praise the whole night long. What followed was a marathon exaltation-fest of boisterously paying homage to damn near every object of worship they could find, each stop wilder than the last. At one point, fresh off of adoring a well whose water David once sought from the cave of Adullam, the rowdy Magi picked a fight with another trio of wise men out worshiping over who had better gifts. Caspar and Melchior impishly ran off from the scuffle, only for the normally soft-spoken and timid Balthazar to trounce his three opponents solo and victoriously ride to their next destination on his cheering friends’ shoulders. Records also indicate an instance where Melchior got so out of his mind on pious devotion that he started adoring a completely ordinary donkey he thought a star was pointing him toward while the other two howled with laughter. And while details of this particular fiasco remain hazy, we now know that a disastrous misunderstanding over where the bathroom was got the Magi in so much trouble that their names and faces were permanently added to the “DO NOT LET ADORE” wall at the tomb of the biblical matriarch Rachel. Damn! Sounds like these hooligans got up to a crazy amount of reverence. While their stop at the Nativity of Jesus will obviously remain the focus of most contemporary Christian practice, we’d love to see a few artistic depictions of the Magi giddily coaxing a whole room full of fellow religious pilgrims to form a rip-roaring kickline with them at a grungy South Bethlehem dive temple. Considering how interchangeable all the crèches you see around Christmas are, surely someone could switch things up by arranging a tableau in their yard of the Magi excitedly making it rain gifts of gemstones and fine silks so generous that the blessed old guy they were adoring leapt up and started adoring the Magi right back. And failing that, maybe just a simple scene of the three biblical wise men blearily staggering back to their hotel under the morning sun, preparing to sheepishly inform their distant kingdoms that they’d be taking the rest of the day off, and tomorrow too. Boy, it sounds like visiting the newborn Christ was just the tip of the iceberg for these unstoppable adoration-hounds. Our hats are off to them for kneeling down, paying homage, and generally tearing up the town like no one ever has since!"
Dad’s Not Going to Like This: Mom Just Passed Away,N/A,https://clickhole.com/dads-not-going-to-like-this-mom-just-passed-away/,"Oh God. Here’s hoping Dad isn’t pissed off when he comes home from work tonight, because the news we have for him would only make a bad mood even worse: Mom just passed away. Yikes…Dad is definitely not going to like this. Even though she knew that this is exactly the kind of thing that would ruin Dad’s night, Mom went ahead and had what we can only guess was some type of stroke or heart attack 30 minutes ago, and now she’s just lying there, dead on the kitchen floor. While Dad isn’t always the easiest to please, he for sure liked Mom or else he probably wouldn’t have stayed with her this long, so the fact that she’s now fully dead is gonna be like when the Phillies lose times 5,000. The old man’s gonna throw an absolute fit! To make matters even worse, it seems like Mom was holding a glass measuring cup at the time her heart stopped, so not only is she just dead on the floor, but there’s also little bits of glass everywhere, which we are never gonna hear the end of. It’s been like 15 years since the time we accidentally shattered a light bulb, and Dad still acts like he gets little pieces of glass stuck on his foot from that. (Not to mention, this means Mom obviously didn’t finish dinner before she died, so there’s that, too.) Goddammit. Might as well get the spackle out now, ‘cause Dad will probably punch a hole in the wall when he learns about this. And if the situation wasn’t already bad enough, there’s also a football game on tonight, so now instead of getting to drink a couple Michelob ULTRAs while unwinding in the basement, Dad’s gonna have to spend the night calling Mom’s side of the family—including his mother-in-law, the last person he ever wants to call—and informing them that Mom passed. When he realizes all the shit that’s now on his plate, he’s seriously gonna go through the roof. Ugh, we are in for a terrible night here. Welp, Nose Goes on who’s gonna have to tell him, ‘cause you know whoever breaks the news to Dad is gonna get an earful. Maybe we can just leave a note that says what happened and go hide out at a friend’s house ‘til he calms down? Honestly, that might be the move. Oh, and rest in peace, Mom!"
Real-Life Homer Simpson? This Man Is Yellow And Knows Maggie,N/A,https://clickhole.com/real-life-homer-simpson-this-man-is-yellow-and-knows-maggie/,"Lance Houghton is a high school history teacher from Knoxville, Tennessee, and at first glance, he might just seem like a regular guy. But on closer inspection, there’s a good chance he’ll remind you of a certain iconic TV character, as, amazingly, he is yellow and knows Maggie—just like Homer Simpson! Wow! It’s almost like Homer Simpson himself crawled out of the TV to live in our world. Due to the heretical books his mother read while she was pregnant, Lance was born yellow like a lemon and yellow like the sun. And being yellow, it felt almost like a stroke of fate when he met Maggie on a train in 2006, kicking off a friendship that’s continued to this day, with the two regularly keeping in touch over email. Most of the time, Lance is just a normal guy who happens to be bright yellow like the banana’s bitter peel, but several times a day, he gets emails from Maggie saying things like, “This is Marge’s friend Maggie. Let’s meet in the woods to exchange information,” and then he’ll have to go to the woods to exchange information with Maggie. If you’re reading this and thinking, That sounds like Homer Simpson to me, you’re not the first! What’s it like being basically the exact clone of a classic TV character like Homer? Lance says most of the time it’s fine, though he does get some good-natured ribbing from his students. “Sometimes during class I’ll mention that I received an email from Maggie, and the kids will all start laughing and saying things like, ‘Hey, Homer Simpson, where’s Carl?’ or, ‘Hey, Homer, do you live near Carl and think about Lenny all the time?’ Their taunting makes me furious, but it’s against the rules for me to do anything about it. I guess it’s just the cross I have to bear for being yellow like the sun and knowing Maggie. Something about that combo just makes people think of Homer Simpson.” Lance says that in addition to emailing with Maggie and meeting her in the woods to exchange information several times a week, he also occasionally sees her on the train and waves at her. He says that getting to know Maggie has been boring, and that she is one of the most uninteresting babies he’s ever emailed with. “There’s basically nothing to know about Maggie except that she sleeps in a crib and her best friends are Marge and Lenny,” the real-life Homer Simpson explains. “The only other thing I’ve learned about Maggie after all these years of emailing is that she co-owns a racehorse with Larry David and Carl.” Uh, last time we checked, the only other bright yellow man with any knowledge of Maggie’s financial dealings lives in Springfield and goes by the name Homer J. Simpson. Honestly, looking at Lance, you’ll swear it’s actually Homer Simpson turned real by a magic spell—the resemblance is almost spooky! Nonetheless, it’s still pretty cool, and we hope that Lance will say hi for us next time he meets Maggie in the woods to exchange information."
Stabbed In The Fucking Back: The Oxalic Acid Present In Kale Is Inhibiting This Man’s Absorption Of The Calcium He Ate The Goddamn Kale For In The First Place,N/A,https://clickhole.com/stabbed-in-the-fucking-back-the-oxalic-acid-present-in-kale-is-inhibiting-this-mans-absorption-of-the-calcium-he-ate-the-goddamn-kale-for-in-the-first-place/,"It’s a harsh truth of this world that you can’t trust anyone, and one poor bastard just learned the hard way that giving someone a chance only opens the door to betrayal: The oxalic acid present in kale is inhibiting this man’s absorption of the calcium he ate the goddamn kale for in the first place. Judas Iscariot. Benedict Arnold. And now kale. Gutless fucking betrayers, the lot of them. In recent weeks, 28-year-old Hector Frith has been trying to add a bit more calcium to his diet to increase his bone density, and innocent, trusting naif that he is, he thought throwing a bit of kale into his afternoon smoothie would be the perfect way to do it. The deceptive, pro-kale propaganda on the internet lured him in with fantastic promises of nutrient density, bandying about sensational claims that kale is a “superfood” with even more calcium per calorie than a glass of milk. And while this indoctrinating hype may bear some superficial truth, it conveniently omits kale’s inner duplicity, for hidden among that supposed bounty of calcium is oxalic acid, a nasty little saboteur working to inhibit Frith’s bodily absorption of that calcium like a dagger between his fucking ribs. This cruciferous bitch would have rotted away on a supermarket shelf if Frith hadn’t taken it in with open arms, and this is how the ungrateful traitor repays him. You think he’s eating that bitter motherfucker for the taste? For the weird, fibrous texture it imparts to his smoothie? He was willing to overlook a lot of baggage kale brought with it on the condition of getting some calcium, and it still turned that oxalic acid on him like a schoolyard bully slapping a nerd’s cafeteria tray out of his hands. Sure, Frith technically could have broken down the oxalic acid by cooking the kale instead of blending it raw, but fuck anyone trying to shift responsibility off the rat who brought oxalic acid into the mix to begin with. And to anyone saying that kale actually has much less oxalic acid than spinach, and is thus one of the better leafy greens for adding calcium to one’s diet, let us ask you this: If you help out a stranger and they shoot you once in the leg, do you really think it exonerates them that some other asshole out there would have shot you twice? Inhibiting calcium absorption is a dirty, low-down trick to pull on somebody who believes in you. As if the hit to his body’s calcium absorption wasn’t bad enough, that perfidious bastard kale has gone ahead and twisted the knife—just taking away the calcium from Frith’s own fucking guts wouldn’t be enough, you see. No, because he really has to suffer for having ever trusted kale, some of that oxalic acid is also going to make its way into his bloodstream and then his kidneys, where it will bind with his precious calcium to make calcium oxalate, better known as the most common form of kidney stones. So while Frith’s brittle, bird-like bones are crumbling into powder from his inhibited calcium absorption, he’ll also get to enjoy shredding his urethra to ribbons with some jagged little shards, all courtesy of his good friend kale. Only then, once he’s broken and agonized and begging for death, will kale’s betrayal truly be complete. God, it makes us furious seeing kale double-cross a guy like this. Here’s hoping that two-faced, deceitful snake in the grass kale gets everything that’s fucking coming to it! "
Major Settlement: Sony Has Agreed To Pay $60 Million To This Man Who Woke Up 30 Minutes Before His Sony Alarm Clock Went Off,N/A,https://clickhole.com/major-settlement-sony-has-agreed-to-pay-60-million-to-this-man-who-woke-up-30-minutes-before-his-sony-alarm-clock-went-off/,"Sometimes, all it takes is one bad customer experience to do irreparable damage to a company’s reputation. A major electronics manufacturer has just learned that lesson the hard way: Sony has agreed to pay $60 million to this man who woke up 30 minutes before his Sony alarm clock went off.  Yikes. Whoever’s in charge of quality control at Sony is definitely getting fired. In an out-of-court settlement, Oklahoma resident Robert Woods received $60 million in damages from the Japanese conglomerate as redress for an incident that occurred one morning last February, when his alarm clock went off at 7:45 a.m. on the dot—30 whole minutes after he’d already woken up. According to Woods’ testimony, he shot awake for no apparent reason around 7:15 a.m. even though he’d specifically set his alarm for 7:45, and was subsequently unable to fall back asleep, forced to watch each agonizing minute tick by on his faulty alarm clock until it sounded off half an hour later. Woods’ attorneys painted a damning picture of the emotional distress and mental anguish Woods endured as he sat in bed wide awake with absolutely nothing to do but mull over random thoughts and stare at the ceiling, wishing desperately that he were still asleep and perhaps even having an interesting dream—a wish that would have been his reality if his alarm clock had actually woken him up at the time it was intended to. Ultimately, the evidence in Woods’ favor was so strong that Sony settled behind closed doors for $60 million rather than risking a trial over the $100 million in damages he’d initially sought. “If you’re already awake by the time your alarm clock goes off, well, that doesn’t sound like an alarm clock to me—that sounds like you’ve been scammed, which my client was, by Sony,” wrote Woods’ lawyer in a statement to the press about the massive settlement. “My client is satisfied with the outcome of this suit, and we appreciate that Sony has chosen to do the right thing, but this was never about the money. It’s about making sure no one else falls victim to an alarm clock that goes off after they’ve already woken up.” To say the least, it’s a very, very bad day to be Sony. Oof! Our thoughts go out to Robert Woods. Sure, you might think $60 million sounds nice, but odds are, it will never truly make up for what he lost when his Sony alarm clock failed him. All we know for sure is now that justice has been done, Mr. Woods may sleep a little better tonight. Rest well, Mr. Woods!"
What A Mess: Zoo Officials Are Having Trouble Measuring This Giant Snake Because It Keeps Twisting And Spinning Around And Suffocating The Zoo Officials Until They Die,N/A,https://clickhole.com/what-a-mess-zoo-officials-are-having-trouble-measuring-this-giant-snake-because-it-keeps-twisting-and-spinning-around-and-suffocating-the-zoo-officials-until-they-die/,"If you’ve been having a rough day at work, just be thankful you aren’t one of the employees at the Bronx Zoo stuck in this complete mess of a situation: Zoo officials are having trouble measuring this giant snake because it keeps twisting and spinning around and suffocating the zoo officials until they die.  Yikes, what a headache! It appears the surviving members of the Bronx Zoo staff are no closer to measuring the snake than they were this morning.  Earlier today, zookeepers began what was supposed to be a routine measurement of the Bronx Zoo’s reticulated python as part of the animal’s semi-annual health check, but the simple task turned into a frustrating dilemma without end: since the moment Bronx Zoo staffers brought it into the medical enclosure, the snake has not ceased to writhe and squirm and wrap itself around them repeatedly, making it seemingly impossible to assess its length. Every time the zoo workers think they’ve finally straightened out the snake, usually by having one employee sit on its tail as the others pull its upper half across the enclosure, they barely have time to measure three feet of the behemoth python before it starts jerking around and biting again. Soon the snake is flipping out one way and curling back up the other with a screaming staffer crunched up in its coil, and the staffer is forced to use his last breath to shout out how many feet he was able to measure before succumbing to the snake’s uncooperative embrace.  Though the zoo employees have tried a few alternative methods for measuring the beast, such as duct-taping a retractable tape measure to its head and sprinting as fast they can towards its tail, and seeing how many yardsticks they can get the snake to swallow in succession, the results are always the same: another dead zoo worker, and no measurement. So far, six staffers, including both high and low level Bronx Zoo employees, have been killed in their attempt to find out how long the python is, and unfortunately, every ruler-clutching corpse the snake has crushed in its powerful coil is one less helper they have to finish the job. As if this ordeal wasn’t difficult enough, sadly, it gets worse: the snake measurement is due by the end of the day, meaning these zoo officials have absolutely no choice but to keep trying unless they’d like to get chewed out by their boss.  Oof. The Bronx Zoo really, really needs to come up with a solution for how to measure this thing without it flopping all over the place and murdering everybody. Hopefully a guesstimate suffices, because it does not seem like these zoo workers are going to get a precise measurement of this snake anytime soon. Wish them luck in the comments—they’re definitely going to need it to finish the job."
"She’s Not Interested, They’re Paid To Be Nice To You: The Elephant at The Zoo Is Walking Right Up To You",N/A,https://clickhole.com/shes-not-interested-theyre-paid-to-be-nice-to-you-the-elephant-at-the-zoo-is-walking-right-up-to-you/,"Look, you might think you’re a real big shot due to the connection you’re making with a captive pachyderm right now, but you might want to stop and think this one through before you let the interaction go to your head: The elephant at the zoo is walking right up to you, but she’s not interested. She’s just paid to be nice to you. Yes, she’s ambling directly up to where you’re standing and swinging her trunk in a friendly manner, but keep in mind that that’s literally her job. Sure, it might have been exciting when you walked up to the elephant exhibit a few minutes ago and instantly made eye contact with a 2.3 ton female Elephas Maximus named Jane—it’s natural to think that when an elephant takes a specific interest in you, it might be because they noticed something special in your aura that captured their attention. What you’re forgetting, though, is that Jane was hired by the zoo to do exactly what she’s doing now: clomp on over, flick her ropey tail around, and make you feel special, all so that you keep buying zoo tickets and coming back for more. Do you really think that Jane would rather take time out of her day to eat lettuce from your hand than go play with the huge rubber tire on the other side of her pen? Please. She has plenty of lettuce in her habitat. Her actions right now might feel like the real thing, a genuine spark, but they’re customer service, pure and simple. When you leave, another poor sap’s going to show up, and she’s going to touch his hand with her trunk the same exact way she just did to you. Sorry, man, that’s just how it works. You’re probably thinking that when Jane repeatedly slapped her trunk into a puddle nearby you, she was trying to imply that there was some sort of playful vibe between you she’d like to continue exploring. But that couldn’t be further from the truth, and if you try to show up again later tonight to see if she’s interested in hanging out some more, she’s going to be more peeved than excited—in fact, she might not even remember who you are. Again, it is her *actual job* to do the whole “cute elephant” act. The emotional labor she’s putting into making you feel good is something she gets compensated for. That’s why she’s here. Honestly, you need to shut down the fantasy that she’s over there splashing mud all over herself for you, because it’s frankly egotistical, and it shows total ignorance as to what it means to be a working elephant catering to thousands of zoo goers a day. If you want a real connection, maybe you should go chat up an elephant in the wild—one that doesn’t have a financial interest in you.  Sorry to be harsh, but this is something you need to get through your head, both for Jane’s sake and for yours. She’s not into you. You’re not special. Just move on."
A Rare Win For You: The New Person Your Ex Just Started Dating Turned Out To Be A Four-Toothed Elf Who Lives In The Dumpster Outside A Safeway,N/A,https://clickhole.com/a-rare-win-for-you-the-new-person-your-ex-just-started-dating-turned-out-to-be-a-four-toothed-elf-who-lives-in-the-dumpster-outside-a-safeway/,"We hate to say it, but you know as well as we do that you’re not typically one to “win” a breakup. Half the time you get dumped unceremoniously, only to find out a month later that your former partner is with someone much hotter, smarter, and more successful than you. But this time, somehow, it seems like things have finally swung your way: The new person your ex just started dating turned out to be a four-toothed elf who lives in the dumpster outside a Safeway. Yes! A rare win for you. When you heard from a friend that your ex-girlfriend Megan just started seeing someone new, you went on Instagram bracing yourself for a self-esteem-shattering post featuring Megan grinning next to a muscular guy with perfect teeth and an awesome haircut. Her post, however, revealed a very different story: As it turns out, the person who Megan just featured in an Instagram carousel with the caption “six months with this guy <3” is a four-foot creature, seemingly of elfin sticked based on his pointed ears and large bow-and-arrow. And if the first image she posted is accurate, it appears that he enjoys crouching barefoot in a Safeway parking lot with his long, matted hair shrouding his entire tiny body. The pictures and videos Megan chose to share of her new beau do not depict the cool high-roller you initially feared, but instead an apparently non-human freak with four jagged teeth, who communicates mostly in shrieks of “Eeeeee!” and “Squirrel!” While it felt a little pitiful to be stalking Meagan’s IG stories, it paid off majorly when you saw that she posted “Chilling at @VandairDwint’larn’s apartment” accompanied by a photo of what was clearly a dumpster full of unsold rotisserie chickens and crudite plates. You don’t even have to be dating anybody right now to know that you straight up won this breakup! Way to go! What’s almost sadder than it is vindicating is the fact that it doesn’t even seem like Vandair Dwint’larn likes Megan that much—he responded to her anniversary post with “lol,” and in half the pictures she posts of him, he seems way more focused on hunting down a parking lot rat than on her. Basically, Megan might be getting the fuckboy treatment from this trash elf, which is clearly a way worse situation than anything you’ve experienced post-breakup. Yeah, you came out on top this time, and in a big way. As long as you aren’t begging for attention from a girl with very few teeth and an all-rodent diet, it seems like you’re doing all right. You can stand up a little taller today knowing that your ex is, for once, not doing way better than you. Nice!"
A Beautiful Tribute To A Feminist Icon: Victoria’s Secret Is Retiring Nancy Pelosi’s Bra Size,N/A,https://clickhole.com/a-beautiful-tribute-to-a-feminist-icon-victorias-secret-is-retiring-nancy-pelosis-bra-size/,"After Nancy Pelosi announced she wouldn’t be seeking another term as House Speaker, she received an incredibly heartwarming outpouring of support and gratitude for her years of tireless political work. Now, one of the biggest women’s brands in the world is honoring her public service in an absolutely beautiful way: Victoria’s Secret is retiring Nancy Pelosi’s bra size. What a deeply moving tribute! If any progressive icon deserves such all-star treatment, it’s Nancy! In a public statement released earlier today, Victoria’s Secret revealed that in recognition of the two decades that the California congresswoman led House Democrats, their company is officially retiring her bra size, 36D, from their catalog of available products. The statement explained that starting immediately, in Victoria’s Secret stores across the country, customers looking for 36D bras will instead find an empty sales display containing a portrait of Nancy Pelosi on a black-and-gold plaque, engraved with a commemoration of all the barriers she broke for women in D.C. as the first female House minority whip, the first female House minority leader, and eventually, the first female Speaker of the House. “By preserving 36D’s affiliation with Nancy’s name and Nancy’s name only, Victoria’s Secret hopes to permanently enshrine her contributions to American politics and female empowerment,” the brand’s press statement continued. “After carving out a 30-plus-year career breaking the glass ceiling and fighting for equality, justice, and progress in an environment as cutthroat as Washington, it’s become rightly impossible to disassociate 36D-sized brassieres from Nancy. This bra size is now Speaker Pelosi’s for all time. This is our small gesture of gratitude for all you’ve done, Nancy. Your service will not be forgotten.” Simply perfect. This is how you honor a legend! Needless to say, whoever takes over the House Speaker position next will have giant bra cups to fill, because this rare honor has cemented Nancy Pelosi’s status as one of American politics’ most influential women. Here’s to you, Nancy!"
Empowering Their Customers: Long John Silver’s Has Announced It’s Okay To Gaslight And Emotionally Manipulate Your Partner If You Can Get Some Long John Silver’s Out Of It,N/A,https://clickhole.com/empowering-their-customers-long-john-silvers-has-announced-its-okay-to-gaslight-and-emotionally-manipulate-your-partner-if-you-can-get-some-long-john-silvers-out-of-it/,"Have you ever found yourself craving a certain food so badly that you’ll do just about anything to get your fix? Most of us have found ourselves in this position at some point, and it looks like one major fast food company is aiming to capitalize on this kind of desperation: Long John Silver’s has announced it’s okay to gaslight and emotionally manipulate your partner if you can get some Long John Silver’s out of it.  Wow. Apparently, there’s no line that can’t be crossed in the pursuit of Long John Silver’s.  The popular seafood chain unveiled a new marketing push this week endorsing numerous forms of toxic, controlling behavior towards your loved ones, so long as it nets you a combo meal or even just a few sides from Long John Silver’s. The campaign recommends myriad tactics for eroding your partner’s psyche and sense of independence from you until they submit to your desire for Long John Silver’s whenever it strikes, with suggestions including, “Threaten to kill yourself if you don’t go to Long John Silver’s for dinner,” “Cut off their contact with family and friends who’ve expressed a concern for how much Long John Silver’s you’ve been eating lately,” “Convince your partner you haven’t been to Long John Silver’s in months even though you both went there the night before,” and “Accuse them of trying to punish you if they suggest making food at home instead of going to Long John Silver’s.” Additionally, the fast food company rolled out a new slogan (“If They Loved You, They Would Take You To Long John Silver’s”), as well as a series of commercials centered around a husband who wages psychological warfare against his wife. One TV spot opens with the husband enthusiastically suggesting Long John Silver’s for dinner, with the wife replying, “I’m not really in the mood for Long John Silver’s tonight.” The husband’s smile slowly contorts into a cold glare as he responds, “You clearly don’t care about me,” cuing a playful boat bell sound effect. The ad then cuts to a montage showing the wife’s mental state deteriorating as the husband methodically manipulates her through various means: throwing out all the food in their house and accusing her of forgetting to buy groceries, giving them no choice but to eat at Long John Silver’s again; claiming she doesn’t love their family if she won’t leave her job early to pick the kids up from school so he can spend more time eating Long John Silver’s; and giving her the silent treatment and slamming doors around the house after she cooks fish and chips at home as a compromise.  The ad closes with a shot of the husband ecstatically biting into a fish sandwich while the wife silently sits across from him, looking as though she hasn’t slept in weeks. “When you get the hankering for fish deep-fried to golden perfection, breaking down a significant other’s self-esteem is always justified,” exclaims a narrator before adding, “And for those being emotionally manipulated, nothing helps bury the internal anguish quite like an 8-piece Coconut Popcorn Shrimp—only at Long John Silver’s,” as the husband pushes a tray of popcorn shrimp towards his sullen wife. Whoa.  Whether you like their food or not, there’s no denying that this is incredibly bold marketing. Kudos to Long John Silver’s for providing customers with a thorough blueprint for driving one’s partner to the brink of insanity in order to secure delicious fast food—it’ll definitely come in handy whenever hunger strikes."
"A Beautiful Tribute: When This High School Janitor Was Decapitated In A Trash Compactor, Local Students Honored His Memory By Starting An Urban Legend About A Headless Garbage Freak",N/A,https://clickhole.com/a-beautiful-tribute-when-this-high-school-janitor-was-decapitated-in-a-trash-compactor-local-students-honored-his-memory-by-starting-an-urban-legend-about-a-headless-garbage-freak/,"Prepare to have your heartstrings tugged, because a community rocked by tragedy has found an amazing way to keep the man they lost alive in their hearts: When this high school janitor was decapitated in a trash compactor, local students honored his memory by starting an urban legend about a headless garbage freak. Wow, what a thoughtful tribute! Now he’ll never be forgotten. North Reading High School was devastated last year when longtime custodian Mickey Stoughton was tragically decapitated after the school’s trash compactor accidentally activated while he was inside performing routine maintenance, but the students there refused to let his memory just fade away. Instead, they created a bone-chilling myth that Stoughton’s headless body still stalks North Reading High’s halls after dark, warping from trash can to trash can during the day through the power of the garbage compacted into him, waiting to catch an unlucky student unawares and take their head for his own. Even a full year after his untimely death, the kids still celebrate his legacy by lobbing their trash from six feet away from the bin so the Garbage Freak can’t thrust out a grime-encrusted hand and drag them to their doom. It’s beautiful just how alive Stoughton’s memory feels on the high school’s campus. Hardly a day goes by without a student pulling their sweater up over their head and sneaking up behind a classmate before grabbing their neck and shrieking “Garbage Freak got you!” to scare the fucking shit out of them. Tales of near misses with the shambling half-man, half-garbage monstrosity are a ubiquitous topic of cafeteria smalltalk, with older students telling younger ones that anytime a classroom’s lights flicker, it means the Garbage Freak has warped through his trash vortex to silently lie in wait in that room’s garbage can. And whenever a student moves away to another town, you can be sure someone will claim that their mutilated, garbage-covered corpse was actually found sticking halfway out of a secluded bathroom’s paper towel bin, only for the faculty to cover up the Garbage Freak’s grisly handiwork to keep the school from being shut down. He must have been a truly special janitor to get memorialized with an urban legend like this. Of course the kids who were around when Stoughton was will all graduate eventually, but the stories of the maggot-infested ghoul who insatiably shoves rotten food and used tampons into his gaping neckhole show signs of enduring well into the future. Even freshmen who never got to meet the janitor in life know that if you can hear the telltale crinkling of the Doritos bags in his legs, it won’t be long before you feel the jagged edge of a broken lunch tray slice clean through the tendons in your neck. And as long as kids keep daring each other to break in after hours and see who can stand in front of the door to the Garbage Freak’s lair in the trash compactor room the longest without pussying out, the memory of their faithful janitor will continue to be honored. This is such a heartwarming way for these kids to pay their respects. Kudos to them for stepping up with this urban legend to make sure no one ever forgets their late decapitated janitor!"
Tasteless And Offensive: Dave Chappelle’s Divisive ‘SNL’ Monologue Completely Neglected To Mention Jewish People’s Incredible Land Speed,N/A,https://clickhole.com/tasteless-and-offensive-dave-chappelles-divisive-snl-monologue-completely-neglected-to-mention-jewish-peoples-incredible-land-speed/,"Dave Chappelle’s opening hosting bit on Saturday Night Live this weekend addressed Kanye West’s recent antisemitic comments head-on, but unfortunately, not only was the comedian’s performance both disappointing and offensive, it failed to acknowledge plain truths: Chappelle’s divisive SNL monologue completely neglected to mention Jewish people’s incredible land speed.  Wow. This is not acceptable and should not be normalized. During his controversial appearance, Chappelle seemed to make light of stereotypes about Jewish representation in Hollywood, all the while ignoring the fact that people of Jewish descent have the fastest average land speed of all human ethnic groups at 34 mph, and in ideal windless conditions can top out at a whopping 51 mph. If Chappelle really wanted to actually explore the perception of Jews in American society, he could easily have drawn attention to the countless Jews who can handily outpace antelope in long-distance runs, or the fact that just five months ago, Jewish woman Miriam Cohen broke the world female land speed record in a sprint at Utah’s Bonneville Salt Flats. But instead, Chappelle chose to actively suppress facts like these and set the Jewish people back years in the process. It’s one thing to poke fun at Jewish stereotypes, but it’s quite another to willfully ignore the fact that Jews have been consistently pushing the boundaries of human velocity for centuries, and by not acknowledging this important aspect of their identity, he’s shamefully reducing them into caricatures that fit into his narrow-minded comedic narrative.  If Chappelle truly “stands with all his friends in the Jewish community,” it’s strange that he chose to obscure the Jewish community’s lightning-fast foot speeds, among other admirable traits. Every year, Jewish people continue to get closer and closer to eclipsing cheetah’s as the world’s fastest mammals, but no one seems to want to mention that when antisemitism is in the news. Shame on Dave Chappelle for his tasteless words—the Jewish community will likely not soon forget them."
A Beautiful Tribute: This Woman Always Feels Kind Of Bad When She Sees That The Time Is 9:11,N/A,https://clickhole.com/a-beautiful-tribute-this-woman-always-feels-kind-of-bad-when-she-sees-that-the-time-is-911/,"The September 11th attacks were a horrible tragedy that changed our nation forever, and it is vital that we reflect upon them with great solemnity and respect. The following story is about a woman who treats that infamous day with the gravity it deserves: this woman always feels kind of bad when she sees that the time is 9:11.  Wow. What a beautiful way to remember those who lost their lives in that brutal terrorist attack. In a powerful tribute to the thousands of Americans who tragically died on 9/11/2001, every time 36-year-old Kristen Lionne looks at the clock and sees that it’s 9:11, an uncomfortable gloom enters her mind and does not fade until it’s 9:12 or she forgets about it—whichever comes first. Even though Kristen will sometimes go weeks or months without ever explicitly noticing that it’s 9:11, whenever she does, she will shake her head back and forth as a memorial both to those who died in the attacks themselves and those who passed away trying to save others.  A patriot through and through, Kristen feels the same tragic pangs in her gut whenever she checks out at a shop or cafe and the total comes to $9.11. When this happens, she often shares her moment of remembrance by making a wincing face at the cashier while saying “yikes” before handing over her credit card, at which point the cashier usually cannot help but nod somberly in return.  What an incredibly moving gesture. It’s clear Kristen carries the tragic history of 9/11 close to her heart. Let her beautiful tributes serve as an example to us all!"
Another False Alarm: The Ambulances Outside Henry Kissinger’s House Last Night Were Just There To Explain His First Wet Dream To Him,N/A,https://clickhole.com/another-false-alarm-the-ambulances-outside-henry-kissingers-house-last-night-were-just-there-to-explain-his-first-wet-dream-to-him/,"Seeing emergency vehicles pull up to a 99-year-old’s residence might cause you to jump to some pretty understandable conclusions about that person’s health, but it turns out one surprisingly resilient nonagenarian has defied our expectations yet again: The ambulances outside Henry Kissinger’s house last night were just there to explain his first wet dream to him. Guess we still haven’t seen the last of this guy! When we learned that EMTs had been called to the home of former Secretary of State and unconvicted war criminal Henry Kissinger late last night, we assumed the old man’s long life had finally come to a close, but it turns out the only “emergency” they’d been summoned to address was alleviating Kissinger’s panic and confusion over having experienced his first-ever wet dream. Kissinger apparently called 911 in a panic, anxiously telling the police that assailants had snuck into his room to smear him with a “poisonous goo” that was causing his body to induce “a terrible seizing of the groin.” Upon arriving and taking stock of the situation however, medics informed him that he had merely experienced his very first nocturnal emission, adding that while this phenomenon typically starts several decades earlier in most boys, it’s nevertheless a harmless and perfectly normal part of growing up. The EMTs spent the next several hours patiently fielding all sorts of questions from Kissinger (who remained naked from the waist down the entire time) about his wet dream: Whether he should expect to have wet dreams every night, whether it’s a type of peeing, and whether girl former Secretaries of State like Condoleezza Rice could have wet dreams too. The medics also took the time to helpfully put Kissinger’s stained sheets through the wash and spread up his bed with a fresh set so he’d be able to go back to sleep whenever he finally stopped crying. They even dutifully fulfilled Kissinger’s request to search his house for the ample-bosomed German schoolmarm who had made him feel strange by coyly unbuttoning her blouse at him, gently reassuring him that she was most likely just a made-up memory from his wet dream and not a real person still hiding on the premises. We sort of figured Henry Kissinger would dream about things like the ghosts of his countless Cambodian victims throwing him through the bomb bay doors of a B-52, or at least being extradited to stand trial for his role facilitating brutal state terrorism in Latin America, but apparently he has wet dreams too. As of last night, anyway. Honestly, we thought it would have been a heart attack or something. Kissinger may have made it through the night unscathed, but that’s more than can be said for major news outlets like CNN and The New York Times, who were forced to retract overhasty obituaries they’d put up with corrections that Kissinger had actually experienced a nocturnal orgasm instead of dying. Wow, looks like everyone’s initial read of this situation was way off the mark. It probably won’t be long before Kissinger finally bites it for real, but given that he just had his first wet dream at 99, who knows what other curveballs he’ll throw us first!"
Holding Themselves Accountable: NPR Has Apologized For The Steve Bannon Tiny Desk Concert Where He Played ‘Cherry Pie’ With Alex G And Waxahatchee,N/A,https://clickhole.com/holding-themselves-accountable-npr-has-apologized-for-the-steve-bannon-tiny-desk-concert-where-he-played-cherry-pie-with-alex-g-and-waxahatchee/,"NPR’s beloved Tiny Desk Concerts series is facing some major criticism following a recent episode, but it looks like the organization is at least able to admit when they’ve messed up: NPR has apologized for the Steve Bannon Tiny Desk Concert where he played “Cherry Pie” with Alex G and Waxahatchee. Yikes. As bad as this was, it’s good to see NPR owning up. Last week, NPR released a Tiny Desk Concert headlined by Steve Bannon, President Donald Trump’s disgraced former Chief Strategist who was recently sentenced to four months in prison for criminal contempt of Congress after defying a subpoena from the January 6th Committee. The video, which was met with immediate backlash from NPR’s predominantly liberal fanbase, begins with Steve Bannon sitting down at the desk and noodling around on the guitar while he says, “We’re gonna play a couple songs for you today, if that’s alright with you,” receiving little to no response from the NPR employees in the room. “I’ll take that as a yes,” Bannon quips before adding, “If the Beatles could get by with a little help from their friends, so can I,” at which point he is joined by NPR darlings Alex G and Waxahatchee. After taking their seats in front of the infamous NPR bookshelves, the trio launched into a raucous cover of Warrant’s “Cherry Pie,” with Bannon singing and playing guitar, Alex G on drums, and Waxahatchee crooning out the backing vocals. While it’s unclear why NPR thought this was a good idea, the cover was clearly enjoyed by the NPR staff at the taping, because when Bannon yelled, “Everybody now!” before launching into an a Capella version of the final chorus, the entire office can clearly be heard singing, “She’s my Cherry Pie / Cool drink of water, such a sweet surprise,” while clapping along. Facepalm. Someone at NPR definitely got fired for this one. The video was immediately downvoted on YouTube and criticized by NPR fans, Alex G fans, Waxahatchee fans, and Steve Bannon fans alike. Soon after, NPR removed the video and offered the following statement of apology: “We sincerely regret producing a Tiny Desk Concert with Steve Bannon. After discovering Bannon’s SoundCloud full of thoughtful reimaginings of rock classics, we were under the impression that we were showcasing a rising star while at the same time offering viewers a chance to see exciting artists in a new setting. We now see that we were wrong. We know that we should never have given a platform to Steve Bannon, whose racist ideology has fueled hatred in this country, even if he absolutely nailed his instrumental riff in ‘Cherry Pie,’ which he then perfectly segued into an emotional cover of The Killers’ ‘When You Were Young.’ We’re sorry to our listeners and our community, and we want to thank you for holding us accountable.”  Wow. While it may take a good while for NPR’s reputation to recover from this truly ill-advised Tiny Desk Concert, it’s good to see that the organization appears to be genuinely sorry for the misstep. Kudos to NPR for trying to make things right!"
Hard To Watch: Joyce Carol Oates Is The Closest Thing To A Celebrity At This Sacramento Kings Game And She Won’t Stop Making Gross Little Concoctions With The Concession Stand Food,N/A,https://clickhole.com/hard-to-watch-joyce-carol-oates-is-the-closest-thing-to-a-celebrity-at-this-sacramento-kings-game-and-she-wont-stop-making-gross-little-concoctions-with-the-concession-stand-food/,"There’s nothing like seeing your favorite famous people courtside at an NBA game, showing off in style while enjoying some world-class basketball. Unfortunately, though, the stars aren’t necessarily out in droves tonight at the Golden 1 Center in Sacramento: Joyce Carol Oates is the closest thing to a celebrity at this Sacramento Kings game, and she won’t stop making gross little concoctions out of the concession stand food. Oh, damn. This sucks. It was clear from the first quarter of tonight’s Sacramento Kings vs. Cleveland Cavaliers game that there was a woeful lack of A-list spectators in the building, as the Jumbotron operator has been focusing primarily on 84-year-old literary fiction writer Joyce Carol Oates, who is sitting in a coveted floor seat and has spent most of the game combining soft pretzels, sodas, burgers, and nachos into disgusting snack hybrids which she then wolfs down as if she has not eaten in months. Oates arrived at the game alone with a copy of her own novel Because It Is Bitter And Because It Is My Heart, and spent her first several minutes facing away from the court, reading her own book and laughing uproariously. But the next time the Jumbotron caught her, she had begun tearing up pieces of a bratwurst sausage and placing them in an Icee, which she then ate with a spoon, causing groans to erupt across the stadium. Since then, every time she has showed up on the big screen, the pile of food wrappers strewn around her seat has grown larger and larger as she continues to gorge on newly devised Frankenstein snacks, such as the beer-drenched, licorice-wrapped corn dog that she referred to as “meat-horn delight,” which she eagerly devoured while wholly ignoring the fast-paced, high-flying NBA action taking place not 20 feet from her. As far as celebrity sightings at sporting events go, this one is definitely disappointing. Other than a tweet from another fan mentioning that he spotted her in “dirty black pants” and “extremely wet hair,” there’s been virtually no social media chatter about Oates’ presence at the game, even after she wandered onto the court during halftime to pour most of a root beer float into her mouth and then chase it down with only the meat from a taco al pastor. During the third quarter, Oates was nearly knocked out of her chair by Domantas Sabonis as he chased an errant ball out of bounds, but the elderly author remained somehow unfazed as the Jumbotron caught her diligently creating tiny sandwiches out of tortilla chips and rapidly melting Dippin’ Dots while the seven-foot center crashed right at her feet. By this point, spectators were clamoring to see footage of anything else, but the camera operator seemed committed to doing justice to Oates’ stature in the literary world by featuring her prominently on the Jumbotron throughout the game. Yeah, she’s definitely no Spike Lee or Jack Nicholson, as her presence courtside, if anything, seems to be making the game much less enjoyable for other fans. But, hey, at least she got to enjoy a bunch of snacks. Here’s hoping that someone much more famous shows up to the next game!"
It Was A Good Run: Scientists Have Confirmed That The Golden Age Of Streaming Will Be Humanity’s Final Golden Age Of Any Kind,N/A,https://clickhole.com/it-was-a-good-run-scientists-have-confirmed-that-the-golden-age-of-streaming-will-be-humanitys-final-golden-age-of-any-kind/,"All good things must come to an end, and new data has revealed that a beloved measure of human achievement is in the midst of its swan song performance: Scientists have confirmed that the golden age of streaming will be humanity’s final golden age of any kind. Hey, we had some real banger golden ages back there. At least they’re going out on a high note! Incredible advances in the world of streaming have allowed us to enjoy fantastic wealths of high-quality content like never before, and according to an interdisciplinary panel of researchers studying human progress, streaming’s current golden age will in fact be the last such period of excellence and innovation our species ever sees in any field. Sure, we’d hoped we might get another golden age of rail travel, perhaps some cool futuristic golden ages of cybernetics and intergalactic exploration, but the scientists’ projections make it crystal clear that streaming is the end of the line where eras of peak human achievement are concerned. Of course, things like Broadway musicals and medicine and the internet will still continue to exist in one form or another—they’ll just never experience another distinct period in which they’re particularly good. However bittersweet this news is, you’ve gotta hand it to the golden age of streaming for being such an amazing last hurrah to go out on. Just think: Today, a person can hop on the Criterion Channel app to watch a superb restoration of Elem Klimov’s 1985 Soviet anti-war masterpiece Come and See, and then seamlessly navigate over to Netflix to enjoy the action-packed spectacle of the phenomenal Stone Ocean arc of JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure. And they can do it from their couch, their bed, the bathroom, wherever! Want to rewatch Paddington? It’s a button press away. Want recommendations for shows similar to The Righteous Gemstones? The HBO Max algorithm’s got you covered. Modern viewers have at their fingertips a robust archive of classic film and television as well as a constant deluge of must-watch original programming, and while we would have loved for humanity to get a few more golden ages in, the golden age of streaming certainly would have been a tough act to follow. At least we’ll always have the memories of heightened cultural and scientific output! Though human civilization is definitely going to be all downhill after the golden age of streaming, the scientists made sure to point out that their findings only apply to humanity and don’t rule out the possibility of other non-human golden ages. Sure, we might be heading into an era of terminal decline characterized by creative mediocrity and technological stagnancy ourselves, but you can’t act like spotted lanternflies aren’t riding pretty high right now. Rising sea levels too could be considered a kind of golden age for the ocean, at least in terms of pure size. And even some long-forgotten diseases like polio are roaring back for a 21st century renaissance. So things fizzling out for humanity won’t be the end of golden ages entirely, it’s more like we’re just passing the torch. Well, having periods of extraordinary human achievement sure was nice while it lasted. Make sure you enjoy the golden age of streaming as much as you can while you’ve got it, because once it ends in a couple years, that’s it for us! "
‘Avast!’: The Principal’s Still Committing To The School’s ‘Talk Like A Pirate’ Spirit Day Over The Morning Announcements While Saying There’s An Active Shooter in the Building,N/A,https://clickhole.com/avast-the-principals-still-committing-to-the-schools-talk-like-a-pirate-spirit-day-over-the-morning-announcements-while-saying-theres-an-active-shooter-in-the-building/,"Aye, mateys, hear ye of a wild tale currently unfolding at yon Greenville High School, one so cringe-worthy that it’ll leave ye wanting to walk the plank: The principal’s still committing to the school’s “Talk Like A Pirate” spirit day over the morning announcements while saying there’s an active shooter in the building. Shiver me timbers! Batten down the hatches, Greenville students! At 7:39 this morning, Principal Walter Crutchfield, who showed up to work in an eyepatch and bright red bandanna in honor of the school’s Talk Like A Pirate spirit day, was in the middle of encouraging students to “round up their doubloons” to purchase homecoming tickets when he received word that an adult male had entered the building with an automatic rifle and fired multiple shots near the gymnasium. Not wasting a moment, Principal Crutchfield bravely did his duty as both a protector and a spirited principal, shouting “Avast! Thar’s a mean son-of-a-biscuit-eater on the deck! Teachers and students, commence active shooter protocol immediately, and keep yer sea legs about ye!” Panic quickly began to spread in the main office as security rushed to ascertain the shooter’s location, but Principal Crutchfield did not once drop his pirate-like affect, barking “Heave ho! Blow the man down!” while exhorting students to remain in place and refrain from talking. As more shots were heard, screams from nearby teachers and students were punctuated by Principal Crutchfield’s theme-day-appropriate cries of “Blimey!” and “Send that scoundrel to Davy Jones’ locker!” Police finally arrived on scene after five tense minutes, and Principal Crutchfield could be heard informing them that the “mean ol’ scurvy dog” was last spotted “lurking about the crow’s nest,” a term he had apparently coined for the third-story science wing, the school’s uppermost section. He was later escorted from the school still wearing his eyepatch, with the fake parrot he had brought from home perched safely on his shoulder even as he hugged teachers and fellow administrators with tears in his eyes. Principal Crutchfield, you old sea dog, you are a true swashbuckler, and we commend ye for your unbreakable school spirit! This terrible tragedy may have happened on Talk Like A Pirate Day, but it certainly didn’t stop Talk Like A Pirate Day, and we have the principal to thank for that. It’s a pirate’s life for him!"
It’s Not Just For Show: Tootsie Roll Just Revealed That The Tootsie Pop Owl Wears A Graduation Cap Because He Has A B.A. In Hotel Management From Rice University,N/A,https://clickhole.com/its-not-just-for-show-tootsie-roll-just-revealed-that-the-tootsie-pop-owl-wears-a-graduation-cap-because-he-has-a-b-a-in-hotel-management-from-rice-university/,"If you like Tootsie Pops, you’ll definitely want to know this amazing fun fact about their beloved mascot: Tootsie Roll Industries just revealed that the Tootsie Pop Owl wears a graduation cap because he has a B.A. in hotel management from Rice University.  Wow! Good to finally know what the deal is with the Tootsie Owl’s headwear! In a press release earlier today, Tootsie Roll Industries clarified that their owl mascot’s graduation cap isn’t a style choice but rather a subtle nod to the fact that he’s a proud alumnus of Houston’s Rice University, having graduated 29th in his class with a bachelor’s degree in Hotel Management. The statement explained that he resided in Duncan College Dormitory his freshman year, spent his sophomore through senior years living in an apartment off-campus with several friends he made in the university’s Anime Club, and that he received significant financial assistance through the G.I. Bill. While the Tootsie Owl was initially disappointed about not being accepted to Cornell University’s hospitality program, his first choice for college, Tootsie Roll Industries says he ultimately had a great experience at Rice University, and that he still roots for the school’s football team to this day. “We’re ecstatic to finally unveil the rich history behind the Tootsie Owl’s graduation cap, a proud memento of the four best years of his life that he spent studying hospitality at Rice University,” wrote Tootsie Roll Industries in the press release. “Though he ultimately chose not to work in the hotel industry, he remains proud of having earned his B.A. in hotel management, and he treasures the lifelong friendships he made at Rice. During his time in college, he had a serious girlfriend who he dated from his sophomore through senior years. Her name was Hannah. She majored in engineering. We don’t know whether Hannah was an owl or person or some other kind of animal, but it was the first long-term relationship either of them had ever been in. It ended on mutual terms, and was a healthy experience for both of them. Sometimes, when the Tootsie Owl puts his graduation cap on in the morning, he still thinks of her.” Fascinating! Who could’ve guessed there was so much backstory behind that owl’s hat? Odds are you’ll never look at a Tootsie Pop the same way again now that you know the Tootsie Owl studied hotel management at a quality university and got generally good grades."
Social Media Nightmare: Some Bot Created An Instagram Account Imitating This Woman And All Her Friends Decided They Like The Fake Account Better,N/A,https://clickhole.com/social-media-nightmare-some-bot-created-an-instagram-account-imitating-this-woman-and-all-her-friends-decided-they-like-the-fake-account-better/,"As our lives become increasingly online, we’re faced with new challenges and problems that arise from spending so much time on social media. Case in point: Some bot created an Instagram account imitating this woman and all her friends decided they like the fake account better. This is so horrifying. What an absolute nightmare for this lady. Two weeks ago, Chrissy Teller, a 29-year-old living in Virginia, noticed an Instagram account in her “suggested for you” section that had her exact profile picture and the handle “@c_teller_93_,”  a clear knockoff of her own IG handle, “@cteller93.” The false account had already gained about 40 followers, so Chrissy quickly reported it as spam and posted a message on her story urging her friends to unfollow and report the fake account. Unfortunately for Chrissy, though, her story only encouraged more of her friends to follow the bot, which in turn led to the bot’s most recent post getting 85 likes, which is more than Chrissy ever gets on her pictures, even though they’re literally the exact same pictures. How awful! Chrissy is literally living everyone’s worst social media fear right now. Although Chrissy has sent repeated emails to Instagram to get the fake account taken down, the account remains up, and honestly, seems to be widely beloved by all her friends. Whenever the account posts a photo, whether it’s one ripped from Chrissy’s account or a spammy post about sunglasses, Chrissy’s friends eagerly comment with positive messages like, “You go girl!” and the fire emoji. And whenever the bot account comments something inscrutable on one of her friend’s pictures, like, “Hello sexy I am selling feet pics DM to comment for a good time,” her friends happily respond with replies like, “Omg classic!” and, “That’s so you.” To make matters worse, Chrissy’s friends have even started tagging the bot in photos of Chrissy and apparently have a private group chat going, the contents of which Chrissy isn’t allowed to know about. Chrissy has asked her friends to unfollow the bot multiple times, but they’ve said that the bot’s deals on weight loss pills just can’t be beat, and that they would prefer to follow the bot instead of Chrissy unless she can get them a better deal on weight loss pills. Wow. It looks like it’s time for Chrissy to get some new friends, because it seems like as long as this account is still active, her friends are going to side with the bot over her every single time. The rest of us can only shake our heads sadly and pray that something like this never happens to us. Sorry, Chrissy! "
"Sad, But Sexy: The Torso They Dredged From The Lake Has A Six Pack",N/A,https://clickhole.com/sad-but-sexy-the-torso-they-dredged-from-the-lake-has-a-six-pack/,"The following story is unfortunately quite disturbing, but thankfully, it is a bit sexy as well: The torso they dredged from the lake has a sick pack! Wow. RIP to an unidentified hunk! Earlier this morning, the police department in Traverse City, Michigan recovered a recently dismembered torso of a male currently identified as John Doe, though we have to assume it was probably something more like Chad or Antonio given the chiseled abs that were instantly visible as soon as the chiseled torso was pulled out of the lake’s murky depths. It was 7:43 a.m. when a member of the team first noticed the toned, glistening abdomen floating near the easternmost side of the lake and positively identified it as the body of an absolutely yoked human male, sending a wave of horror, shock, arousal, and insatiable sexual desire through the crowd of police and onlookers present. Though no other body parts were recovered during the subsequent four-hour search of the lake, investigators suspect that the victim’s toned legs, bulging biceps, and broad, angular face may well have been disposed of within a mile of his picture-perfect midriff. This is so sad and erotic. Whoever this man’s loved ones are, they must be in a great deal of pain right now. We would hate to think that they, particularly any tall, handsome brothers who might be in the family, are without comfort at this time. The police department immediately launched a homicide investigation when the torso was recovered, and have since been working around the clock since to determine who might have harmed this hot and innocent victim—whether an intimate partner, a coworker, or perhaps a similarly sexy foe who engaged him in a sweaty wrestling match on the oily floor of an auto repair shop before the tragic crime took place. It is truly heartbreaking, and yet also so tempting, to think that this poor beefcake was likely stripped naked by his attacker, his taut and tanned skin exposed in some dark, sensuous wooded clearing under the moonlight, all before he was torn limb from limb and thrown in the lake for us to cry and drool over. Though the timeline of events is not yet clear, we are certain that as more details come out, we will be provided with a more detailed and tantalizing picture of the attack. There is no doubt that whoever did this committed an absolutely heinous crime and took the life of an adonis-like male specimen. We hate to see such awful violence take place, though the sight of the torso itself was, to be frank, as stimulating as it was harrowing. Here’s hoping the police solve this case ASAP and provide justice for our new dead, headless crush. He deserves it!"
Absolutely Bewildering: These Children Call Their Grandpa Exclusively By His Full Name (Walter Feldman) But Refer To Their Grandma Only As ‘Puzzles’,N/A,https://clickhole.com/absolutely-bewildering-these-children-call-their-grandpa-exclusively-by-his-full-name-walter-feldman-but-refer-to-their-grandma-only-as-puzzles/,"Brace yourself for total confusion, because the following story is seriously a head-scratcher. Apparently, these children call their grandpa exclusively by his full name (Walter Feldman), but refer to their grandma only as “Puzzles.” Wow. This is absolutely bewildering. What sort of system is at work here? For some inexplicable reason, the three Feldman children in Amherst, MA, don’t just refer to their grandparents as something normal like Grandma and Grandpa, but instead “Walter Feldman” and “Puzzles,” which is one of the more indecipherable combinations of names possible. Seriously, though—how did these kids arrive at these names? Did the kids come across their grandfather’s mail and start calling him by his full name? Is their Grandma addicted to puzzles? Is this some kind of cultural thing? Did the kids think of the names, or did the grandparents come up with them on their own? The more one examines these bizarre names, the less sense they make. But not only are these names outrageous, but they don’t even remotely fit together in a pair. Honestly, if it were something like “Walter Feldman” and “Geraldine Feldman,” or “Puzzles” and “Riddles,” that’d still be wild, but at least it’d be symmetrical. “Walter Feldman and Puzzles” just seems to have no logic behind it all. You can tell everyone agrees these names are bizarre, too, because whenever the kids are out in public with their grandparents and they yell something like, “I want ice cream, Walter Feldman!” or “Puzzles, can we go to the movies?” everyone within earshot turns to watch in shock.  Even more confounding is the fact that the kid’s parents refer to the grandparents by utterly different names as well, calling Walter Feldman “Chevrolet Malibu,” despite the fact he doesn’t drive one of those, and Puzzles “Mrs. Kline,” despite the fact that’s literally not her name. This is truly a mystery. Here’s hoping the kids grow out of this and start calling their grandparents something more normal soon, because this is seriously confounding, and quite honestly, it’s stressful to think about. "
Devastating: Anthony Hopkins’ Family Has Announced That He Only Has One Night Left Before The Spell Wears Off And He Turns Back Into A Gourd,N/A,https://clickhole.com/devastating-anthony-hopkins-family-has-announced-that-he-only-has-one-night-left-before-the-spell-wears-off-and-he-turns-back-into-a-gourd/,"Get ready for some absolutely heartbreaking news. It turns out one of the most beloved actors of all time will not be with us for much longer: Anthony Hopkins’ family has announced that he only has one night left before the spell wears off and he turns back into a gourd.  This is so terrible. We’ll always have his movies, but it’s depressing to think Sir Anthony Hopkins never grace the screen in his human form ever again! In a statement to the press, the family of renowned actor and enchanted gourd Anthony Hopkins revealed that tonight marks the very final evening that he will walk the Earth as a man, and at the stroke of midnight, he is due to transform back into the butternut squash he was born as in a Welsh country garden. According to the statement, the 84 year-old Academy Award-winner remains in high spirits, as he’s known that he’d inevitably return to his gourd form since the moment a witch’s spell turned him into a real living boy back in his younger years, which were largely spent in the soil, doing nothing, for months at a time, until the hex blessed him with a human body that enabled him to crawl out of the dirt and study the performing arts at the Royal Welsh College Of Music And Drama.  Hopkins is reportedly grateful to the witch, Eglantine, whom Hopkins has not seen or heard from since, for letting him know the exact time and date of his reversion back to gourd form, “for it allowed him to not just emotionally prepare for his return to gourd-dom, but also incentivized him to take advantage of each and every moment he spent out of the soil.”  “While of course we’re mourning the impending re-vegetablification of our beloved Anthony, we are beyond comforted knowing that so few gourds can say they lived as fulfilling and joyful a life as he did,” the actor’s daughter, Abigail, wrote in the statement, which also revealed that once the spell finally wears off, Hopkins has requested to be placed back into the original garden he was grown in. “As the clock strikes twelve tonight, the body our father inhabited will vanish in a shimmer of sparkling light and once more become a squash, but his legacy will live on through the countless accomplishments he achieved during the time he spent not being a squash, such as being the very first former-and-future gourd to be knighted by the Queen of England, and being only the third once-and-future gourd to win a BAFTA award.”  Ugh, we are literally ugly crying right now! What a beautiful tribute to Sir Anthony! “Most gourds blessed with the body of a human person choose to waste the duration of their spell-time on drinking, drugs, having sex with humans that resemble gourds, gambling, violent crime, or in many cases, working a boring day job for decades on end to support an unfulfilling home life, returning to their gourd form bitter, resentful, and full of regrets. But our Anthony was different. He did not choose such frivolities. He chose art, service, philanthropy, and beauty. We will miss him dearly, though not as much as he will miss the human friends he made along his marvelous detour from his existence as a squash.” What a huge loss to the acting community. Without a doubt, Anthony Hopkins has served as a stellar example of how gourds can live if a witch uses magic to turn them into a human for some period of time. We were truly so fortunate to have witnessed him exist and make movies as a human, and wish him the best of luck as he becomes a butternut squash once more. Farewell, Sir Anthony!"
Absolutely Devastating: This Man Is Too Afraid To Buy His Weekly Twix Bar Because The Packaging Now Has A Ghost On It,N/A,https://clickhole.com/absolutely-devastating-this-man-is-too-afraid-to-buy-his-weekly-twix-bar-because-the-packaging-now-has-a-ghost-on-it/,"We hope you’re ready to cry, because this story is just about the saddest one we can imagine: This man is too afraid to buy his weekly Twix bar because the packaging now has a ghost on it. It’s absolutely tragic that this terrifying imagery is keeping him from his once beloved snack. Glenn Wheeler of Pittsburgh, PA used to eagerly anticipate the after-work candy bar he’d buy himself as a treat every Friday afternoon. But unfortunately, what was once a joyful ritual has turned into a gauntlet of horrors, as the Twix he loves so much is now packaged in a wrapper depicting a ghastly phantasm with an evil grin on its undead face. This nightmare began nearly three weeks ago, when Glenn ambled unsuspectingly to the CVS candy aisle and reached for his typical Twix. As soon as he looked down at what he had just grabbed, he let out a strangled scream, nearly dropping the candy bar as he looked into the black eyes of the shadowy wraith on the wrapper. Rather than choose a different sweet to buy, Glenn ran out of the CVS and drove straight home, locking his door behind him as visions of the devilish ghost danced in his head. “Never in my life have I experience terror like I did the moment I laid eyes on the vile hellhound that now haunts the Twix bar,” Glenn said. “Instead of the mouthwatering sensation I normally get when I pick out my favorite candy, I felt a cold chill run through me, and I knew that the Twix ghost would stalk me until my dying day if I so much as brought the bar near my home. The candy is no longer safe.” This is so heartbreaking. It took another two weeks before Glenn worked up the courage to enter his local CVS again, and sadly, he met with a similar fate when he began to browse the chocolate and was greeted with images of spiders, witches, and howling jack-o-lanterns, not just on the Twix bars but on almost any candy he could possibly have chosen as a snack. More terrified than ever, Glenn swore off that CVS location, reasoning that it must be haunted. However, his expeditions to a Walgreens and a Kroger grocery only terrified him further, as he was stalked by the image of the ghost at every turn. Now, Glenn has gone almost a month without enjoying a candy bar, and he does not know when he might get to eat one again. How awful. We are so devastated to hear about what has happened to this poor man. No one wants to experience utter horror when they’re just trying to buy a snack, but apparently, that is the reality for some. Good luck, Glenn. We are rooting for you."
Burying The Hatchet: Noel And Liam Gallagher Have Set Aside Their Differences To Help Lower A Pervert Into A Pit Toilet,N/A,https://clickhole.com/burying-the-hatchet-noel-and-liam-gallagher-have-set-aside-their-differences-to-help-lower-a-pervert-into-a-pit-toilet/,"Few celebrity rivalries are as legendary as the feud between Oasis frontman Liam Gallagher and his brother, guitarist Noel Gallagher, who seemingly hurl bitter, hateful insults at each other every chance they get. But after over 10 years of not speaking, there is finally a sign their relationship may be on the mend: Noel and Liam Gallagher recently set aside their differences to help lower a pervert into a pit toilet.  Holy. Balls. Do we hear the first sounds of a new Oasis album in the works?  The momentous event between the “Wonderwall” performers happened at a campground outside of Manchester where the brothers were coincidentally both separately spending the weekend. Liam was first to spot the pervert struggling to lower himself into the campground’s pit toilet but clearly lacking the strength to safely do so without breaking a leg under the weight of the wetsuit, snorkel, camera equipment, and week’s supply of food and water the disgusting sex freak was carrying. Liam approached the man, whose penis was already erect at the prospect of spending days being used as a human toilet and protruding through the masturbation access hole he’d cut into his diving suit, and asked if he needed help. The man gave a muffled affirmative reply from under his diving mask, and Liam started to help the sex freak climb down into the filth. Liam began attempting to shove the pervert down through the toilet’s seat and lower him into the sewage below, but quickly realized there was no way he could do it alone. In a panic, he shouted outside the pit toilet for help. Suddenly, without saying a word, Noel Gallagher stepped through the half rotten pit toilet door and was shocked to see his brother for the first time in over a decade, dangling a pervert down into toilet’s foul muck. His initial reaction was to turn away and start heading back to his tent, but upon realizing there was no other way this pervert was going to get all the way inside the pit toilet without his help, he stayed to assist the brother he despised so deeply.  This is an absolutely amazing day for rock and roll! The reunion Oasis fans have been waiting for for years has finally happened! Struggling against the toilet’s fumes, swarms of black flies, and their deep-seated hatred for one another, the brothers worked hand over hand to carefully lower the already-masturbating feces lover down into the dark, stinking hole. With two men on the job, they were able to easily send the pervert off on his sick adventure into the horrifying depths of the outhouse. After the pervert fully submerged under the human waste with a “glunk,” the two brothers stood in silence together in the cramped, reeking toilet, unable to look one another in the eye for what seemed like an eternity. Finally, Liam quietly muttered, “Well then,” to which Noel awkwardly replied, “Very good.” The brothers then took turns using the pit toilet’s hand sanitizer pump before Noel left without saying another word while Liam stayed behind to use the bathroom.  If you’re not openly weeping with joy right now, then you don’t deserve to listen to music! It’s incredibly heartening to see the Gallagher brothers finally taking the first step towards healing their relationship, and of course we selfishly hope their experience helping the sex weirdo into the pit toilet has planted the seeds for some kind of Oasis reunion. Their mutual hatred for one another not only destroyed a band destined to be the next Beatles, it destroyed a brotherhood. We hope that coming together for the common cause of helping a toilet freak get off helps remind them that life is too short for frivolous squabbles and bitter rivalry, and that these two musical geniuses end up back in the studio together soon. May this wonderful moment be the first step on their long road to recovering their relationship, and possibly a followup album to 2008’s Dig Out Your Soul!"
Disappointing: This Kid Got Bit By An Older Werewolf Who Was Clearly Past His Prime And Now The Full Moon Just Turns Him Into An Extremely Sickly Dog With No Powers,N/A,https://clickhole.com/disappointing-this-kid-got-bit-by-an-older-werewolf-who-was-clearly-past-his-prime-and-now-the-full-moon-just-turns-him-into-an-extremely-sickly-dog-with-no-powers/,"Getting your hopes up can make disappointment all that much more crushing, and one poor teenager is coping with the letdown of a lifetime after an unlucky supernatural encounter: This kid got bit by an older werewolf who was clearly past his prime and now the full moon just turns him into an extremely sickly dog with no powers. Damn, that really sucks. He’s gotta be feeling pretty bummed about how this one turned out. 17-year-old Teddy Greer had been walking home from a friend’s house late one night last April when a paunchy, visibly over-the-hill werewolf waddled out of the nearby woods and bit him before arthritically limping off into the night. Greer spent the next month eagerly awaiting the next full moon to bring him his own lycanthropic powers, but unfortunately for Greer, whatever manner of curse he received from the elderly werewolf definitely seems to have been diminished by his attacker’s advanced age, because when the next full moon came around all it did was transform him into a medium-sized, exceptionally ill dog with no special abilities whatsoever. It’s such a bummer that this kid got bit by such a feeble, aging werewolf! His dreams of becoming a powerful beast of the night have been dashed. To say this has been a letdown for Greer would be a profound understatement. He’d been psyching himself up for the prospect of bounding through the cool evening air with perfect night vision and effortlessly tearing through obstacles with his supernaturally sharp claws. Instead, he now spends every full moon dragging himself around on his two good legs and trying to scratch the extremely itchy sores covering his new canine body. Of course Greer had expected some drawbacks to his transformation, like maybe ruining an outfit because his huge muscular werewolf body burst through it, but that’s way different than ruining an outfit because your diseased dog body soaks it with pus and some foul oily discharge that comes seeping out of his diseased dog anus every time he transforms. The stains don’t even come out in the wash! And Greer’s werewolf form is so phlegmy and congested that he doesn’t even get the benefit of a dog’s heightened sense of smell, which could have at least been a decent consolation prize for not getting a werewolf’s bestial strength or regenerative healing factor. Man, that older werewolf really fucked this guy over. Poor Greer hardly even leaves his bedroom around the full moon anymore, owing largely to a depressing incident where he transformed outside and had to drag himself under a pile of dead leaves until morning to hide from some bored middle schoolers cruelly pelting his feeble, ailing dog body with pine cones. He’s too weak to ever hunt down the werewolf that turned him for revenge, and his teeth are too soft and crumbly to ever pass his affliction onto any of his tormentors with a bite of his own. It’s just a huge letdown, all thanks to that washed-up werewolf. Damn, the whole thing sounds like it’s been a total flop for this kid. Here’s hoping he can find some kind of cure soon, because turning into a powerless, mostly blind dog with dozens of health problems is no way for a teenage boy to live."
Powerful Partnership: Dunkin Donuts And Victoria’s Secret Have Teamed Up To Create A G-String That Smells Like Hash Browns ,N/A,https://clickhole.com/powerful-partnership-dunkin-donuts-and-victorias-secret-have-teamed-up-to-create-a-g-string-that-smells-like-hash-browns/,"It’s always exciting to see two beloved brands come together and create something special, but this collaboration may be the most iconic brand crossover yet: Dunkin Donuts and Victoria’s Secret have teamed up to create a G-string that smells like hash browns.  This is simply brilliant. Dunkin Donuts and Victoria’s Secret have hit an absolute home run with this one! Hitting store shelves at both Victoria’s Secret and Dunkin Donuts locations across the world this week, the Lightly Seasoned Golden Brown Stretch Cotton G-String marks the first-ever collaboration between the coffee and womenswear brands. A press release announcing the partnership explained that fried potato-scented G-string was intended to “unite the smells of a classic breakfast side dish and comfortable women’s underwear into one revolutionary product that’s as sensually alluring as it is aromatically suggestive of hash browns.”  “Consumers enjoy the smell of Dunkin Donuts’ signature hash browns in the exact same way that they enjoy wearing Victoria’s Secret’s undergarments, making this a no-brainer opportunity for our brands to collaborate,” wrote Dunkin Donuts Creative Director Brian Donovan. “The Lightly Season Golden Brown Stretch Cotton G-String combines the sensations of both wearing women’s underwear and smelling hash browns when you walk into a Dunkin Donuts, to create an entirely new consumer experience: wearing women’s underwear and smelling hash browns wherever you are. Thanks to the joint work of the creative teams at Dunkin Donuts and Victoria’s Secret, you can finally look good and smell like finely chopped-and-fried potatoes on-the-go, at an affordable price.” According to the release, the G-string’s powerful fried fragrance is washer-dryer resistant, meaning you’ll never have to worry about leaving the house without your thong exuding a robust, starchy and salty smell. What’s even cooler is that the smell can be intensified to a higher pungency, if customers desire, by simply dipping the undergarment in vegetable oil and microwaving it for 3 minutes. How awesome is that? To promote the hash brown G-string, Dunkin and Victoria’s marketing teams have rolled out a joint nationwide ad campaign, including a commercial in which Victoria’s Secret models saunter down a catwalk in the underwear, surrounded by a blindfolded audience who rapidly the air as all their stomachs rumble. One audience member mutters, “smells like hash browns…” before lifting their blindfold, seeing the models, and saying, “looks like lingerie?” Then, a Dunkin Donuts employee—who’s wearing a shirt and visor but no pants, just the new G-string—leans down to the audience member’s ear and whispers, “It’s both,” which echoes repeatedly over a pulsing bass synth as the ad cuts to the G-string being tossed in seasoning along with hash browns.  Finally, over a shot of the models walking out of a Dunkin drive-thru arm-in-arm, the commercial concludes with a sultry voiceover saying, “Dunkin’s got a Secret: The Hash Brown G-String, starting at $5.99. Available at all Dunkin Donuts and Victoria’s Secret locations nationwide while supplies last.” Wow. What a huge win for consumers who enjoy both hash browns and lingerie! Bravo to Dunkin and Victoria’s for this genius collaboration. Their hash brown G-string is all the proof we need to know that amazing things can happen when two beloved brands join forces. Congratulations to them for this game-changing partnership!"
"Incredible Feat: This Facebook Meme Condenses The Entire 1,200-Page Message Of The Bible Into A Single Digital Graphic Of A Bloody Christ With The Words ‘He Is The Jesus’",N/A,https://clickhole.com/incredible-feat-this-facebook-meme-condenses-the-entire-1200-page-message-of-the-bible-into-a-single-digital-graphic-of-a-bloody-christ-with-the-words-he-is-the-jesus/,"The New Testament is a massive tome filled with numerous parables, vast spiritual knowledge, and a sprawling narrative that have served as the basis for most of Western civilization and a sacred guide for many lives for centuries. Incredibly, a major advancement has been made when it comes to teaching the word of the Bible: This meme on Facebook condenses its entire 1,200-page message down into a digital graphic of a bloodsoaked Christ with the words “He is the Jesus.” Whoa! How the hell did they pull that off?! Biblical scholars and institutions have for hundreds of years poured over the Bible’s nearly 800,000 words seeking to gather and comprehend the wisdom found therein, but now a Facebook page called “Jesus Whispers” has managed to capture the entirety of the Bible’s scriptures on hope, love, discipline, creation, life, and death in a single image. The meme, which has been badly degraded by being shared so much and bears multiple watermarks including “jesushome.io” and “Jesusly,” sums it all up by showing a tortured computer-generated Jesus and boldly declaring in 30 point Impact font that “He is the Jesus.”  The post has over 140,000 shares and 800,000 comments, most of which say “amen,” making it clear that its succinct, carefully crafted distillation of the most-read book on the planet is resonating with the public. It’s pretty clear that the heavy, bulky, wordy, hard-to-understand actual Bible is no longer anywhere nearly as important as it once was, and most Bibles will surely serve merely decorative purposes soon.  Sorry, Christian theologians, but you might want to start looking for a new line of work, because you’re no longer needed.   Whether Jesus Whispers will be able to create similar memes that express the entire belief system of other religions through a single JPEG remains to be seen. It was surely a challenge to sum up such a massive amount of spiritual wisdom in one pixelated, gory image like this one, but if they did it once, they can do it again Amen, Jesus Whispers! He is the Jesus indeed. "
Nature Is Incredible: This Tortoise Is Broadcasting A Wi-Fi Signal,N/A,https://clickhole.com/nature-is-incredible-this-tortoise-is-broadcasting-a-wi-fi-signal/,"The natural world never ceases to amaze. There’s always more mind-blowing facts about wildlife waiting to be discovered. Take this absolutely remarkable finding, for example: This tortoise is broadcasting a Wi-Fi signal.  Simply incredible. Tortoises are truly one of the most fascinating species in the world! As if the massive size and century-long lifespans of Galápagos giant tortoises weren’t amazing enough, Oxford University biologists conducting a field study in a remote region of the Galápagos recently observed a tortoise broadcasting a full-strength Wi-Fi signal from its body. What’s even more intriguing is that the tortoise’s network, named “tortoise-5G”, is password protected, but, by simply guessing the password was “tortoise” the scientists were able to access the animal’s Wi-Fi with ease. It’s a beautiful reminder that for all its seeming complexity, the natural order ultimately abides by a sacred simplicity.  With the nearest router over 4 miles away back at their base camp and no cell phone reception, the scientists were shocked to find that the high-speed internet connection emanating from the reptile measured at -50 decibel milliwatts, allowing the entire research team to game and stream movies with zero lag whatsoever. For some perspective, the natural speed of this tortoise’s free Wi-Fi is better than most premium internet plans available in the United States. If you love the internet AND tortoises, you need to be cheering with joy right now! “We connected all our phones, laptops, and tablets to the tortoise’s Wi-Fi, and the signal strength didn’t decrease whatsoever,” reported lead researcher, Evelyn Carreira, who was stunned when her phone received a notification reading, “Tortoise would like to share the password for ‘tortoise-5G’ with you,” a behavior that demonstrated the giant tortoise’s gentle, non-aggressive behavior. “I suspect the tortoise might have developed Wi-Fi for attracting mates, or perhaps, it’s a holdover from a carnivorous ancestor that used strong Wi-Fi connections to attract prey. Obviously, this species is known for being quite slow, which, in evolutionary terms, makes a lot of sense when you consider how unreliable your home Wi-Fi would be if your router could dash off like a deer. These are all just initial theories, of course. We have so much more to learn about these wonderful animals.” Wow. Nature doesn’t get cooler than this, does it?  The tortoise is currently chained down in the scientist’s base camp, where it’s being used as their primary Wi-Fi network, and allowing them to report their research back to Oxford University over Zoom calls with crystal clear audio and video connections. Well, if tortoises are your favorite animal now, we would not be surprised at all, because this is as extraordinary as animal life gets. Hats off to nature, once again!"
"Huge Relief: The Stock Market Is Doing Terribly, But You Don’t Actually Have Any Stocks Or Money So You’re Fine",N/A,https://clickhole.com/huge-relief-the-stock-market-is-doing-terribly-but-you-dont-actually-have-any-stocks-or-money-so-youre-fine/,"Amid global turmoil caused by COVID-19, the war in Ukraine, and a pending global recession, it can be hard to find anything positive to focus on. Thankfully, there’s one big silver lining for you in all of this mess: The stock market is doing terribly, but you don’t actually have any stocks or money so you’re fine.  Whew! What a massive relief.  Many stocks are seeing their 2021 gains reversed completely, but you can thank your lucky stars that that’s only bad news for people who actually have something to lose financially in the first place. Protecting you from the massive losses many investors are seeing is the fact that your life savings is the $1,409 you have in your checking account to cover next month’s rent and a small collection of old Magic the Gathering cards that you heard might be worth something. Since not a single penny of your money is invested anywhere, you’re going to be just as broke as you already are no matter what happens in the stock market, which is great.  Sure, the 5 shares of Microsoft your grandpa told you he bought for you like 14 years ago might have gone down in value a bit, but since you have no idea how to actually access those stocks and still don’t even really understand if stocks are like a piece of paper you keep in a safe or you need some kind of broker to keep them for you or how all that works, you really shouldn’t be concerned with that right now. The only time you really think about your money is when you check your account balance is to make sure you have enough in there to cover eating out for dinner, which you usually don’t, and that’s why you’ve been able to avoid any financial losses in this current market! Yep, you must be feeling a massive relief right now thanks to not having any assets at all. Could the tumbling stock market still end up causing trouble for you in the future? Considering the fact you barely have enough money to cover your rent and food and spend whatever you have left over on Uniqlo and weed, it’s doubtful. Sure, there’s always a chance you’ll one day land a job that offers a 401(k) or something, but that’s a concern for the distant future. For now, you’re well protected by being broke and having absolutely no investments tied up in the struggling stock market, and that doesn’t look likely to change anytime soon, thank God!"
"A Beautiful Cause: Thom Yorke, Ruben Studdard, And Mason Ramsey Have Recorded A New Version Of ‘We Are The World’ To Raise Money To Support Vagina Dentata Research",N/A,https://clickhole.com/a-beautiful-cause-thom-yorke-ruben-studdard-and-mason-ramsey-have-recorded-a-new-version-of-we-are-the-world-to-raise-money-to-support-vagina-dentata-research/,"If you were hoping to read some uplifting news today, you’re in luck, because three beloved musicians are joining forces for a beautiful cause: Thom Yorke, Ruben Studdard, and Mason Ramsey have recorded a new version of “We Are The World” to raise money to support vagina dentata research.  Absolutely beautiful. If anyone can change the world through music, it’s these three unbelievably generous artists! Officially released today, all proceeds from Yorke, Studdard, and Ramsey’s rendition of “We Are The World” will be donated to medical schools and health science institutes performing research on causes, treatments, and cures for vagina dentata, a condition that makes a person’s vagina have teeth in it. Taking inspiration from the pop supergroup who sang the original “We Are The World” in 1985, which raised over $60 million for humanitarian relief in Africa, American Idol runner-up Ruben Studdard spearheaded this 2022 recording of the charity single after being told about vagina dentata from a nephew, and knowing he had to do something about it.  Studdard immediately leapt into action, personally contacting the Radiohead frontman and the child who went viral yodeling in a Wal-Mart to explain what vagina dentata is and how little is known about it, or if anyone in the world even has it. According to Studdard, Yorke and Ramsey instantly agreed to record the charity song with him, with all three artists pledging to match publicly raised funds for vagina dentata up to $15,000. As for the track itself, Yorke, Studdard, and Ramsey’s “We Are The World” cover opens with sweeping synths set to steel drums and a choir of harmonizing children, as Yorke delivers a heart-wrenching monologue about the suffering caused by toothy vaginas.  “When your children ask what you did in the war against vagina dentata, what will you be able to tell them?” Yorke asks over the song’s uplifting chord progression. “You may be asking, ‘Why should I care about vagina dentata? It doesn’t affect me.’ But it does. Vagina dentata affects us all. Consider the vaginas in your life: your daughter’s. Your sister’s. Your aunt’s. This song goes out to them, and to all the people in the world whose penises have been severed by a rude chomp from a vagina with molars. No matter what race, class, or religion you are, as human beings, we can ALL agree on this: a vagina with a tooth in it is one vagina with a tooth in it too many. Vaginas should be nothing but gums. For what it’s worth, I think my grandmother had vagina dentata—sing it! We are the world! We are the children! We are the ones who make a brighter day, so let’s start giving!” Wow. Just unbelievably inspiring! “It’s tragic that in the year 2022, there still remains virtually no public data about vagina dentata and who it is affecting, if anyone, which is exactly why Thom Yorke, Ruben Studdard, and myself are bringing awareness to vaginas with teeth through the power of music,” explained Mason Ramsey in a press statement released alongside the charity single. “If I ever meet a fan who suffers from vagina dentata, I want to be able to look them in the eye and say, ‘Mason Ramsey has your back.’ With your help, we can be the generation that ends vagina dentata forever.”  To support the charity record, Yorke, Studdard, and Ramsey will perform at a telethon held at Madison Square Garden later this month, where they’ve put out a public call inviting anyone who has vagina dentata to join them on stage in solidarity. With the combined proceeds from the telethon, sales of the single, and merch from the event—such as Vagina Dentata Awareness ribbons and t-shirts featuring a gravestone engraved with “Here Lies ‘Vagina Dentata’ 300 B.C.-2022, Loved By No One”—Yorke, Studdard, and Ramsey say that they aim to raise over $1 billion for research into toothed vaginas. What a powerful example these musicians are setting. This is how you use your platform for good! This is such a heartwarming collaboration. Anyone who thought these A-list musicians weren’t humble enough to give back has just been proven wrong a hundred times over. If you don’t give Yorke, Studdard, and Ramsey’s “We Are The World” a few plays today, you simply don’t have a heart!"
Not Fooling Anyone: Dad Has Disguised His Bald Spot As A Big Bloody Wound And Is Claiming That An Eagle Swooped Down And Took A Chunk Out Of His Scalp While He Was Sleeping In A Meadow,N/A,https://clickhole.com/not-fooling-anyone-dad-has-disguised-his-bald-spot-as-a-big-bloody-wound-and-is-claiming-that-an-eagle-swooped-down-and-took-a-chunk-out-of-his-scalp-while-he-was-sleeping-in-a-meadow/,"Baldness can definitely be a sore subject for many men, but the way Dad is trying to cover up his hair loss is honestly ten times more embarrassing: Dad has disguised his bald spot as a big bloody wound and is claiming that an eagle swooped down and took a chunk out of his scalp while he was sleeping in a meadow. Come on, Dad. You’re not fooling anyone with this scalp-eating-meadow-eagle stunt. Dad has been going bald for approximately ten years at this point, but for whatever reason he chose this week to paint an elaborate wound on his head right where his bald spot sits, and has started telling anyone who will listen that he recently got pecked within an inch of his life by a bald eagle that descended upon him while he was taking a midday nap in a grassy field. There’s a lot going on with his story: First of all, Dad spends all his time either at the office or in the garage working on his car, not taking naps on the ground, let alone “among the wildflowers” the way he keeps describing. And there isn’t even a  recognizable meadow in our town—but he keeps referring to “the meadow where my head got like this” as if we all know what the fuck he’s talking about. Even worse is the fact that he insists that the eagle pulled off his skin “straight down to the bone,” despite the fact that on the day of the alleged eagle attack we all saw him come home from Home Depot looking perfectly healthy. Apparently there are no lengths dad won’t go to to disguise the fact that he’s going bald. We all knew you were bald, dad? Chill? Dad has also taken to spending an entire hour in the bathroom every morning where he previously only spent five minutes, and he’s clearly using his time in there to create the artificial wound. Mom found a huge credit card charge on the account for fake blood and professional special effects makeup, but Dad refused to fess up to it and even spent hours on the phone disputing the charge with Capital One. Rather than give it up, he keeps feigning flashbacks to the moment the eagle allegedly descended upon him as he “slumbered like a child upon the greenery,” and began ripping at his “healthy head of hair.” He insists that he could “see the eagle’s fury in its eyes” even as he’s leaning back in his armchair and we can all see the thick layer of fake gore makeup sort of lifting from his skin and squishing back onto the upholstery. So fucking ridiculous. Dad scheduled an MRI for next week to make sure the eagle didn’t “hit brain,” which is going to be a huge waste of money, not to mention a waste of time for Mom who has to take off work to drive him there. Let’s hope Dad accepts his baldness soon, because this is out of control."
"Not Knowing What Else To Do, Woman Bakes Try Guys Cake",N/A,https://clickhole.com/not-knowing-what-else-to-do-woman-bakes-try-guys-cake/,"TOPEKA, KS—Feeling helpless in the wake of the horrible Ned Fulmer cheating scandal, Christine Pearson baked a cake and decorated it like the Try Guys Monday. “I had to do something to force myself away from YouTube,” said Pearson, 54, carefully laying rows of strawberry slices to resemble the three remaining members of the Try Guys on the white-fudge-frosting-covered cake. “All of those Try Guys. Those poor Try Guys. I don’t know what else to do.” Pearson, who had never before expressed feelings of fandom in cake form, attributed the baking project to a loss of direction. Having already donated blood, mailed a check to the Red Cross, and sent a letter of thanks to the New York Fire Department, Pearson was aimlessly wandering from room to room in her apartment when the idea of creating the confectionery Try Guys came to her. “My friends Cassie and Patrick [Overstreet] invited me over to have dinner and just talk about, you know, everything,” said Pearson, a Topeka legal secretary who has never visited and knows no one in either the New York or Los Angeles Buzzfeed offices. “I thought I’d make something special or do something out of respect for all of the people hurt by Ned’s infidelity. All those innocent people. All those web culture reporters who lost their lives.” Mixing the cake and placing it in the oven shortly after 3 p.m., Pearson sat at the kitchen table and stared at the oven door until the timer rang 50 minutes later. As the cake cooled, Pearson gathered materials to decorate it. She searched the spice cupboard for a half-used tube of black food coloring, but could not find it. After frantically pulling all the cans and jars from the cupboard, she finally found the tube in the very back. Emitting a deep sigh of relief, she spread the coloring over the cake’s upper-left-hand corner to create Eugene’s voluminous black hair. “I baked a cake,” said Pearson, shrugging her shoulders and forcing a smile as she unveiled the dessert in the Overstreet household later that evening. “I made it into the Try Guys.” Pearson and the Overstreets stared at the cake in silence for nearly a minute, until Cassie hugged Pearson. “It’s beautiful,” Cassie said. “The cake is beautiful.”"
"4 Ways The U.S. Is Not Prepared For Another Pandemic, Especially If Through Some Clerical Error A 5 Year-Old Child Is Appointed Director Of The C.D.C.",N/A,https://clickhole.com/4-ways-the-u-s-is-not-prepared-for-another-pandemic-especially-if-through-some-clerical-error-a-5-year-old-child-is-appointed-director-of-the-c-d-c/,"The U.S. was woefully unprepared to respond to an infectious disease like COVID-19, and sadly, despite years of living under the pandemic and millions dead, not much has changed. Here are 4 ways our country remains unequipped to handle another pandemic—particularly if a 5 year-old child is put in charge of the C.D.C. due to some sort of legal technicality that no one can do anything about.  In 2020, hospitals and healthcare workers were pushed to their absolute breaking point. The cost of care alone was enough to deter people, particularly the uninsured, from seeking treatment. Flash forward to today, when a recent survey revealed that the overwhelming majority of U.S. children between the ages of 4 and 6 have no meaningful understanding of healthcare policy whatsoever. That’s why it’s so terrifying to imagine a scenario in which someone at the C.D.C. misfiles paperwork in such a way that results in a five-year-old child—one who has zero helpful knowledge of our healthcare system, or job experience at all, for that matter—being named Director of the C.D.C. for a full term. What’s worse, between kindergarten and after-school activities, there’s little hope a five-year-old would have the time or attention span to address a nationwide containment response for an infectious disease, thus setting up E.R. workers and the uninsured to bear the brunt of the fallout, all over again. Coronavirus only intensified the U.S. political divide. If a five-year-old were put in charge of the C.D.C., it’s all but guaranteed that Republicans and Democrats would point fingers and blame each other for all of that child’s botched work and shoddy leadership instead of working together to figure out how a clerical error got current C.D.C. Director Rochelle Walensky fired and replaced by a prepubescent child whose bedtime is around 9:00 p.m. Sure, Congress could preemptively pass a policy that would prevent anyone under the age of 6 from ever being appointed C.D.C. Director, but sensible legislation like this takes a backseat to political mudslinging and inflammatory rhetoric during the midterm elections. Partisan politics have left us just as vulnerable to another pandemic as we were in 2020, and perhaps more so if someone in the C.D.C’s H.R. department botches their job so badly that a literal child is onboarded as their boss. In 2004, the C.D.C. budget for public health emergency response programs was $515 million. In 2020, it was just $275 million. Whether that budget increased or decreased tenfold tomorrow, a kindergartener still learning the basics of counting to 10 wouldn’t even begin to understand how to effectively allocate those funds to contain the outbreak of a deadly disease. A child that age would likely be overwhelmed considering any amount of money over $20. And that’s in addition to the stress a child would feel if federal officials rolled up to their elementary school in black vans, pulled them from class, and informed them that, due to a loophole in the fine print of some internal C.D.C. document, they’re now in charge of stopping a deadly, ever-evolving virus from killing hundreds of millions of people.  According to Pew Research Center, only 24% of Americans say they trust our government, a number that would almost certainly drop to 0% if a five-year-old were leading one of the most important agencies in the Department of Health. Regardless of leadership skills or how professionally the kid conducts themself, the mere appointment of a child as Director of the C.D.C., due to someone making a clerical mistake like checking the wrong box or mixing up a Social Security number or something, would likely be interpreted as a sign of the same government incompetence that our country’s initial COVID-19 response such a mess. The vast majority of Americans have never taken life-or-death guidance from a five-year-old at any point in their lives, and there’s no reason to expect they’ll start doing so during something as scary as a pandemic.

"Our Primitive Past: 10 Years Ago, Humans Would Have Waited In Line For 13 Hours To Taste A Bacon Cupcake",N/A,https://clickhole.com/our-primitive-past-10-years-ago-humans-would-have-waited-in-line-for-13-hours-to-taste-a-bacon-cupcake/,"The human species has changed countless times since it first began to evolve, and it can be fascinating to look back at history and see just how much we’ve grown from our primitive origins. Take for instance the fact that 10 years ago, humans would have waited in line for 13 hours to taste a bacon cupcake. Wow. It’s truly thrilling to consider how earlier humans used to live! To truly understand why these primordial humans would subject themselves to the elements just for a taste of a maple flavored cupcake with a piece of bacon on top, you must remember that to humans in the dark ages of the early 2010s, bacon was everything. People would load up their home with fake bacon plushies or buy books of poetry about bacon from Urban Outfitters, and comedians could go viral by merely tweeting the word “bacon,” which, amazingly, was even considered a funny joke. And so, for these less-advanced humans of 2012, waiting in a line all day while discussing the new Gotye single to eat a normal cupcake topped with a one-inch piece of bacon was huge. Of course, to the average person in 2022, a bacon cupcake—or any of its derivatives, like the rainbow bagel, the cronut, or the bourbon milkshake—is not only not worth waiting in a long line to eat, but something not worth eating at all. Maybe, just to get a taste of the past, someone will tack on one of these now-passé desserts to their UberEats order of a plant-based protein bowl, but it’s far more likely that, much like hunting for your own food or walking on all fours, waiting 13 hours for a bacon cupcake is simply a lost custom of humanity’s distant past, a strange and alien practice whose full meanings and motivations might never be fully understood. How truly interesting. Although the sight of something like a bacon-encrusted sundae may be nauseating to us now, knowing how appetizing these things were to the millennials in ancient times is a key to understanding our roots."
Is That His Only Move? 5 Different Times Satan Tried To Tempt Me To Sin With Just An Apple,N/A,https://clickhole.com/is-that-his-only-move-5-different-times-satan-tried-to-tempt-me-to-sin-with-just-an-apple/,"When Satan tempted Eve into eating the Forbidden Fruit from the Tree of Knowledge, resulting in her and Adam’s banishment from the Garden of Eden, it was a game-changing sin. No one’s denying that. But, judging by how often he’s resorted to the Fruit Move since then, at least in my experience, it’s pretty clear the King Of Hell is a one-trick pony. Here are 5 different times Satan tried tempting me to sin with just an apple.  My last Christmas was almost ruined by Satan’s really poor attempt to get me to have an affair with my own aunt. I was using the bathroom when the Devil, in the form of a serpent, suddenly appeared on a towel rack, and began whispering about how I ought to have an affair with my 73 year-old aunt. Obviously, I said, “absolutely not.” That’s when Satan shot me a knowing grin and said, “Ah, but what if there were a reward in it for you, say…an apple?” You could tell he genuinely thought this was a sly move, as if offering an apple was a trump card. At first, I was confused. I asked him if it was some sort of ‘special’ apple, or whatever, but all he said was that it tasted “very nice.” After a long, baffled pause, I said no again. He said, “Are you sure?” I just shook my head and went back to the party. Not that anything would tempt me to ruin my life by having sex with a much older relative…you’d just really think Satan could do better than an apple. I mean, he’s the Devil. I can respect that Satan caused the Fall of Man using just an apple, like, that was huge for him, I get it, but I truly think he took the wrong lesson away from that success. A few months back, I woke up to find an apple on my nightstand. It was a normal looking apple. I figured my wife might’ve left it for me, until Satan appeared on my dresser (in the form of a snake, yet again, clearly another crutch for him) and hissed, “That apple could be yours…for a price: the blood of your beloved and your children—kill them in my name, and you may taste an apple’s sweetness!” Again, I asked the Devil if it was a special apple or something. He shook his head no, still grinning all sinister-like, clearly convinced I was about to fall into this half-assed ‘trap.’ I just threw the apple in a wastebasket and left for work. For context, I was stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic after a long, frustrating week at the office, and I’d skipped lunch that particular day. I was in a vulnerable state, which, to Satan’s credit, is a good time to trick someone into doing something, ‘cause sure enough, he popped up on my dashboard (yup, in snake form, which is not even mildly startling at this point, not even while driving). Before he could get a word in, I told him, “I want the apple, what’s your offer?” He smirked and hissed, “Take God’s name in vain” as if that was a mic drop sin or something. Without hesitation, I said, “God is crap.” Boom. Satan laughed and disappeared in a cloud of smoke, and an apple appeared in his place on my dashboard. It tasted like a normal apple. Nothing to write home about. If Satan wants to call that a successful temptation, good for him. I don’t care. I was starving, and I’m not even religious. This was far and away Satan’s worst try at tempting me to sin yet. I was doing yard work on a Sunday morning when a snake (guess who…yeah) slithered out of my hydrangea bushes and right up to me. I gave him a quick smile and tried to ignore him as he went on about this ridiculously overcomplicated sin he wanted me to commit. Something about crashing an Amazon delivery truck into a church and blaming it on my dad? I still don’t understand it. I guess his big evil plan was for me to break multiple commandments at once? Not sure. Don’t care. But yeah, as temptation, he offered up an apple, his go-to move, of course. I just ignored him until he eventually slithered into a neighbor’s yard to try it on them. (UPDATE: My neighbor actually gave into this temptation, for an apple…he’s now facing 30 years in prison. I guess I wrote off the Devil’s apple gambit too soon). It’s unreasonable to expect Satan to hit every temptation out of the park. He got incredibly lucky early on in the history of mankind, and has been trying to recapture that high for thousands of years ever since. He peaked. Tale as old as time. But the day he popped up in my cubicle, draping his snake body around a succulent, and tried to get me to envy a coworker’s apple (???) was just more proof that one of the greatest tempters to ever do it is now past his prime. “Doesn’t your coworker’s apple look nice?” the Devil hissed. “Certainly nicer than this extremely old apple…which could be yours if only you allow your heart to be corrupted by jealousy!” I honestly felt bad that this was the best he could do. I politely declined. “Sorry, not interested.” Instead of getting angry, Satan just seemed bummed out, and slowly faded out of sight. It was pretty sad to watch, I won’t lie. But, until the King of Hell develops some fresh tricks, and stops leaning on apples so much, I don’t think I’ll be tempted by him anytime soon."
Snack Lovers Rejoice! Fritos Is Holding A Contest Where They Erase One Lucky Fritos Lover’s Memory So They Can Experience Eating A Frito For The First Time Again,N/A,https://clickhole.com/snack-lovers-rejoice-fritos-is-holding-a-contest-where-they-erase-one-lucky-fritos-lovers-memory-so-they-can-experience-eating-a-frito-for-the-first-time-again/,"If you’re a snack-aholic, you’re going to want to get in on this action: Fritos just announced they’re holding a contest where the winner gets to have their memory erased so they can experience eating a Frito for the first time again.  Whoa. This is such an amazing opportunity! The rules of the contest are printed on the back of every bag of Fritos currently in stores, and they’re pretty simple. The text reads, “Wish you could experience the satisfying, salty crunch of Fritos corn snacks for the very first time again? Now you can! Fritos is erasing one lucky Fritos lover’s memory and then giving them the option to eat a bag of Fritos with absolutely no memory of how good they are so they can live the experience just like the very first time!”  If that’s not awesome enough, Fritos is also planning on live streaming the winner eating their “first” Frito to capture their speechless reaction and confused joy, so we can all vicariously experience what it would be like to try a Frito for the first time with no knowledge of what they taste like, where you are, who you are, or what anything is. Sounds like the whole world is really going to be the winner here! As every Fritos lover knows, after you eat Fritos for the 600th or so time, the blast of flavor packed in every Frito starts to become so familiar that you begin to take munching down the world’s most perfect snack for granted. We all long to return to a simpler time when we weren’t jaded, a time when every Frito still packed a taste-tastic punch, and now you finally have a chance! Wow. Fritos, you’ve really outdone yourselves with this one.  For most of us, our first Frito is just a faded memory from our childhood before our brains were even fully formed and barely capable of appreciating the signature flavor of the leading corn chip in the nation, so the opportunity to savor a Frito without any memory of what they taste like, or any other memories whatsoever, has the potential to be a highlight of one’s life. Bravo, Fritos, for giving your fans this opportunity. "
"Checkmate, Socialists: If Capitalism Is So Bad, Then How Come This Businessman Is Surrounded By Other Business People And They’re All Laughing?",N/A,https://clickhole.com/checkmate-socialists-if-capitalism-is-so-bad-then-how-come-this-businessman-is-surrounded-by-other-business-people-and-theyre-all-laughing/,"Socialists have long criticized capitalism for exploiting workers, heightening inequalities in our society, and valuing profit over human life, the environment, and social good. That sounds pretty bad, doesn’t it? But if capitalism really is as bad as they say, then how come this businessman is surrounded by other business people and they’re all laughing? Checkmate, socialists!  Don’t you DSA members and Bernie Sanders fanatics think that if capitalism really brought alienation to the working class that this businessman—a guy who’s supposed to be a mere cog in the capitalist machine—would be standing alone and frowning instead of smiling ear to ear with his best friends? Socialists may claim that capitalism causes workers to be paid less than the value of their work, but these happy businessmen are all the proof you need to know that capitalism doesn’t bring exploitation. In fact, it brings smiles.  Boom!! How ya like them apples, socialists? Karl Marx once wrote, “Accumulation of wealth at one pole is at the same time accumulation of misery, agony of toil, slavery, ignorance, brutality, mental degradation, at the opposite pole.” Well, sorry Mr. Marx, but if this is what misery, agony of toil, slavery, ignorance, brutality, and mental degradation looks like, then it looks pretty dang good! Besides, could a suit made by fairly paid American workers in a socialist factory possibly look as good as these ones made by an Italian designer with fabrics imported from Japan? Absolutely not!  Game, set, and match, socialists! Looks like it’s time to break up your little Marxist reading groups and start organizing some Milton Friedman book clubs, because, as this picture of these joyful captains of industry clearly demonstrates, capitalism rocks! Workers of the world, it’s time to unite in defense of capitalism, which clearly gives us only happy times and nice suits! We can’t wait until the free market works its magic on us and we’re all as happy as the guys in this picture. Huzzah!"

So Cool! Parker Brothers Has Announced That ‘Don’t Wake Daddy’ Is Just As Much A Portal To The Undead As Ouija Boards,N/A,https://clickhole.com/so-cool-parker-brothers-has-announced-that-dont-wake-daddy-is-just-as-much-a-portal-to-the-undead-as-ouija-boards/,"One of our favorite childhood board games just got even cooler, because its creators have revealed that it contains an amazing feature we never even knew about: Parker Brothers has announced that ‘Don’t Wake Daddy’ is just as much a portal to the undead as Ouija boards. This seriously the most amazing thing we’ve ever heard! This adds a whole new layer of depth to an already incredible game! The Ouija board has long been an iconic symbol of the occult, but according to a fascinating announcement from Parker Brothers today, the game ‘Don’t Wake Daddy’ is and has always been just as powerful a tool for conveying messages from the spirit world to our own mortal realm. The announcement explains how almost every aspect of the game, from the turn spinner right down to Daddy’s alarm clock, is attuned to allow for direct manipulation by ghosts and all manner of other non-corporeal entities hiding just beyond the veil. And while there are only enough mover pieces for 4 human participants to play, there’s apparently no limit to the number of drowned Victorian children and hanged frontier outlaws that can haunt your game from the Great Beyond. It’s wonderful to realize we’ve been communing with the dead this whole time and didn’t even realize it! “Our fans know that ‘Don’t Wake Daddy’ is a great game for kids as young as 3, but we wanted to make sure people are also aware that it’s just as capable of reaching wandering specters who died as far back as the Roman Empire,” said Parker Brothers founder George Swinnerton Parker, whose 1952 death did not stop him from making the announcement personally via a copy of ‘Don’t Wake Daddy’ as a demonstration of the game’s supernatural properties. “Of course Ouija boards are certainly a terrific means of channeling spirits in their own right, but the next time you wish to pierce the fragile membrane separating the worlds of the living and the dead, try taking ‘Don’t Wake Daddy’ for a spin and see for yourself how well it works!” Wow, this is seriously awesome news. It might not be long before you attend a séance with a game of ‘Don’t Wake Daddy’ laid out on a table lit by a single candle, waiting with heart-pounding anticipation to see whether the restless shade of a Renaissance-era alchemist will let you make it to the refrigerator unscathed or force you to make 4 agonizing presses of Daddy’s alarm clock for having noisily knocked over a bowl of fresh fruit. We can’t wait to dust off our old copy of ‘Don’t Wake Daddy’ later tonight and make contact with forces beyond mortal reckoning!"
Decimating The Arts District: What Was Once A Lively And Bustling Capital One Cafe Is Now A Charmless Chase Bank,N/A,https://clickhole.com/decimating-the-arts-district-what-was-once-a-lively-and-bustling-capital-one-cafe-is-now-a-charmless-chase-bank/,"As gentrification takes its hold on American cities, it can be hard to watch as beloved institutions that once served as home for artists and beatniks are mowed down and replaced by soulless, corporate enterprises. Take for instance this story out of Chicago’s River North neighborhood, where what was once a lively and bustling Capital One Cafe is now a charmless Chase Bank. Wow. Way to decimate the entire arts district. For the last three years, any wayward creative director or account manager in downtown Chicago was welcomed into the open arms of the Capital One Cafe, where they could share Evian bottles and prepackaged Hillshire Farms cheese and meat trays with like-minded millennials while discussing revolutionary ideas, like how to build your personal online brand. At the Capital One Cafe, there was always a friendly Bank Ambassador waiting to suggest ways to diversify your investment portfolio, but tragically, now that the cafe has shuttered, if River North residents want to hear ways to diversify their investment portfolio, they’re going to have to do it at the buttoned up, stodgy Chase Bank instead. This neighborhood is never going to be the same. If you can believe it, for nearly a quarter of a decade, nonconformists were able to pop into this local Capital One Cafe in between conference calls, sip a warm cup of Peet’s Coffee brewed with love several hours earlier, and leaf through a pamphlet about the credit cards available at Capital One while listening to the anti-establishment tunes of underground bands like The Lumineers or Vance Joy. And sure, people could still drop by the Chase Bank to pick up a pamphlet about credit card options, but where are they supposed to read it? In their high-rise condo while drinking a cup of home-brewed Peet’s Coffee while listening to the “Coffee Shop” playlist on Spotify? Please. Everyone knows that experience is just not going to be the same, especially when you’re sitting on your own velvet mid-century modern couch from Article instead of the boucle couch from Article available at the Capital One Cafe. This is seriously so depressing. Once these trends start, it’s only a matter of time until the neighborhood is just living in a shadow of itself. Every day, there are fewer and fewer places where a free-thinking Wharton grad can meet with an older Wharton grad to pick their brain over a shrink-wrapped baguette sandwich, and now it’s only a matter of time before the median rent for a one-bedroom in the neighborhood jumps from an affordable $3500 to an abysmal $3850. What a shame."
Incredible Method Acting: Chris Pratt Paid A Gigantic Turtle To Kidnap His Wife In Order To Prepare For The Role Of Mario,N/A,https://clickhole.com/incredible-method-acting-chris-pratt-paid-a-gigantic-turtle-to-kidnap-his-wife-in-order-to-prepare-for-the-role-of-mario/,"When Nintendo fans learned that Chris Pratt had been cast in the role of Mario in the upcoming Super Mario Bros. movie, it definitely caused some concern among gamers who worried that the action star wouldn’t be able to portray the character in an honest and accurate way. Fortunately, Nintendo fans everywhere can breathe a sigh of relief, because it looks like Pratt is doing everything he can to prepare for the role and truly understand what it feels like to be Mario: Chris Pratt just revealed that he paid a gigantic turtle to kidnap his wife in order to prepare for the role of Mario! So much yes! It’s awesome to know that Chris Pratt is really committed to making his performance as Mario as accurate as possible! “I know how important it is to Nintendo fans everywhere that my portrayal of Mario is completely authentic, so to fully understand Mario’s emotional life, I hired a turtle the size of a minivan to break into my house, steal my wife, and take her back to his apartment so that I could experience the pain that Mario feels every time that Bowser kidnaps Princess Peach,” Pratt wrote in a recent Instagram post. “As I watched that massive, scaly beast drag my wife into the desert, I was consumed by a despair so all-consuming that I felt like I wanted to die. I immediately understood that this existential devastation, this constant desire for death, is what Mario feels every second of every day, and I feel that my performance in this movie communicates Mario’s nihilistic thirst for oblivion in an honest and vulnerable way.” Wow! This is absolutely amazing method acting from Pratt. Daniel Day-Lewis himself couldn’t have prepared more thoroughly for the role of Mario! The gigantic turtle, whose name is Honest Jafar, is 40,000 years old and was born knowing one secret about every human being who has ever lived or will ever be born. Pratt found the 12-ton creature on Craig’s list by posting, “Need tortoise to steal wife. Tortoise can be turtle. Must have shell. Please understand that I’m Pratt.” Later that day, Honest Jafar came stampeding through the wall of Pratt’s home and abducted his wife Catherine Schwarzenegger. Pratt says that he tried to fight off the gigantic turtle “the way Mario would” by “trying to set him on fire” and “eating a mushroom that made me grow three inches taller,” but in the end, Honest Jafar overpowered him. In his Instagram post, Pratt recalls “screaming and weeping like Mario” as he watched the enormous reptile carry his wife away. This is absolutely awesome! If you’re not standing up and cheering in front of your computer right now, then you don’t deserve to call yourself a gamer. Pratt says that following the kidnapping, he tried to rescue his wife, but when he Googled “where is the lizard who took her?” to find out where Honest Jafar’s apartment was, he didn’t get any useful results. He does not expect to see his wife again, but as he tells his fans, “sometimes to become Mario, you need to lose everything.” It’s truly admirable that Pratt is willing to make these kinds of sacrifices for his art! Yep, it’s official: Chris Pratt is putting in the work to explore the depths of Mario’s psyche and fully embody this legendary character. We were a little skeptical at first of the decision to cast him as the beloved plumber, but it’s clear that Pratt fully became Mario during this movie, and truly knows the character inside and out. We can’t wait to see Pratt bring Mario to life on the big screen!"
Heartbreaking: The Only Animal That Talks To This Zookeeper Is The Fat Fucking Turkey That Wanders The Grounds,N/A,https://clickhole.com/heartbreaking-the-only-animal-that-talks-to-this-zookeeper-is-the-fat-fucking-turkey-that-wanders-the-grounds/,"Getting to know all sorts of rare, exotic animals is definitely one of the best parts about working at a zoo, but for one employee at the Philadelphia Zoo, that’s hardly the reality: The only animal that talks to this zookeeper is the fat fucking turkey that wanders the grounds. This is just heartbreaking. Surely this man deserves better than this. Despite the fact that there are animals at the zoo from other continents like Africa or Australia, who would surely be able to recount exciting adventures from their time in other countries, the only animal that talks to zookeeper Phil Macausland is the really annoying turkey that roams around the zoo and talks about absolute bullshit all the damn time. The fat horrible bird just follows Phil around all day, whining about his sciatica, re-telling the same damn story about how his brother (who is also a turkey) stole his girlfriend seven years ago, and begging Phil to give him Tostitos, which he asks for by ramming Phil’s ass with his beak and saying, “Feed me the scoops.” Jeez. This is really rough. Guess it’s better to talk to the turkey than no animals at all, but you’ve got to admit that this is pretty rough. Although Phil has tried to strike up conversations with more interesting animals, like the lions, lemurs, and kangaroos, those animals remain completely silent, leaving him with no choice but to just keep talking to this stupid fucking turkey waddling beside him who’s repeatedly doing his one fucking joke where he goes, “What did the turkey eat for Thanksgiving dinner? His cousin!” which was never even funny the first time. Desperate to save face, Phil makes a point to roll his eyes at whatever the turkey says when other animals can see them so the rest of the zoo won’t think he actually likes hanging out with the turkey. However, it’s hard to beat the reputation when the turkey greets him at the start of every shift by patting his wing against him while saying, “There’s my best friend!” before inevitably launching into a monologue about some stupid bullshit, like governmental tracking, the lab leak theory, or how when it’s hot out he should be allowed inside the polar bear exhibit, even though the turkey definitely knows that Phil would get fired if he did that. Woof. This really is so tragic. Maybe Phil should just let this turkey in the polar bear exhibit and get fired, because losing his job might not be a terrible option at this point. What a sad situation all around. Here’s hoping some other animals start talking to Phil soon, because this turkey has nothing good to say and he just keeps blabbing!"
Two Americas: A New Study Has Found That Goodwills In Richer Neighborhoods Have An Average Of Twice As Many Versions Of ‘Scene-It’,N/A,https://clickhole.com/two-americas-a-new-study-has-found-that-goodwills-in-richer-neighborhoods-have-an-average-of-twice-as-many-versions-of-scene-it/,"For such a highly developed country, the United States has an absolutely shameful level of economic inequality. One stark example of this pernicious problem can be seen all over the country in the nation’s thrift stores: A new study has found that Goodwills in richer neighborhoods have an average of twice as many versions of Scene–It. Wow. To see the insane stratification of wealth in our country presented so starkly is disturbing to say the least. Sociologists at Dartmouth College recently published a paper entitled “Whose Scene Is It, Really? Disparities In Pop Culture-Themed Multimedia Game Access In The Detroit Metropolitan Area,” which examined the concentration and quality of used Scene–It game boxes in the “Home Goods/Miscellaneous” sections of Goodwills in six different Detroit area neighborhoods. Their findings were nothing short of appalling: The wealthiest zip code they studied had an average of two times the amount of Scene-Its in its Goodwills than the poorest, not to mention the fact that these Scene-Its were more diverse in variety than those of poorer neighborhoods and more likely to include coveted Scene-It variants such as Glee Scene–It or Scene It Sports Powered By ESPN. Meanwhile, Goodwills in less affluent zip codes often featured less-than-desirable Scene-Its such as the Turner Classic Movies edition  and Scene–It Junior. What’s more, the Goodwills in the most impoverished areas had a higher incidence of Scene-Its whose cardboard boxes had gotten wet and become warped beyond recognition, as well as game sets that included someone’s discarded 2007 mix CD rather than the DVD required to play the game. How do we expect low-income neighborhoods to thrive when their lack of resources is so blatant and unfair? This is just ridiculous. According to the study, a single parent from a lower-income neighborhood who wants to buy a copy of 2003’s Disney Scene–It to help enrich their child’s understanding of clips from movies like The Incredibles and The Little Mermaid would have to drive an average of 19.6 minutes or spend 58 minutes on public transportation to find a copy of the game that contains both the six-sided and eight-sided dice needed for gameplay. It’s simply unconscionable that this is the reality many Americans have to live with when other well-to-do people are able to waltz into any Goodwill they like and be greeted with not only multiple versions of Scene–It, but likely also a discarded Lord of The Rings Monopoly and a mostly intact Eiffel Tower puzzle as well. This is disheartening, but not surprising. Something needs to be done about the increasing inequality in our nation ASAP, because everyone deserves a fair shot to identify scenes and answer trivia questions from popular 90s and 2000s movies and TV. It’s the only path forward for a truly just society."
Heartbreaking Debacle: The Balloons Carrying Queen Elizabeth’s Body Into Heaven Have Gotten Tangled In A Power Line,N/A,https://clickhole.com/heartbreaking-debacle-the-balloons-carrying-queen-elizabeths-body-into-heaven-have-gotten-tangled-in-a-power-line/,"Following the requisite period of mourning after her death earlier this month, Queen Elizabeth II finally began her ascent into Heaven. However, the late monarch’s trip to Eternal Life has hit an unfortunate snag: The balloons carrying Queen Elizabeth’s body into Heaven have gotten tangled in a power line. Oh no! This is simply heartbreaking! Earlier this morning, the Queen’s body was carried just outside of Westminster Hall and adorned with a dozen ceremonial balloons. Each balloon had written on it a different message, such as, “Next Stop: Heaven!” and “Watch Out Jesus, Here Comes Mrs. Trouble!” Tragically, just minutes after her remaining family members bowed their heads over her body, said the ceremonial prayer of “Yip, yip, yo, off to Heaven ye go!” and tossed the late Queen’s body into the sky, the wind blew the Queen directly toward a power line, where the balloon strings quickly became a tangled mess and her majestic corpse got all pretzeled up in the wires. British officials debated how to best rectify the situation, but most obvious solutions were ruled out immediately. For instance, if they were to cut the power line, all of England would permanently lose power, and if they cut the balloon strings, the Queen would fall downward into Hell. Officials decided to tie several balloons reading “Emergency” to a guard and send him up to the power line to untangle the Queen, but the wind changed course just as soon as he began to get close, and although the guard reached toward the Queen to grab hold of her, he merely pulled off one of the Queen’s shoes and floated up past the clouds instead. Good Lord! Now the guard’s going to Heaven, and the Queen’s missing her damn shoe! This is a dark day for England indeed. Insiders confirm that British officials are currently gluing together as many ladders as they can find in order to make one long enough to climb up to the Queen, at which point they will cover her with Vaseline to hopefully loosen the strings up. Wow. What a truly disastrous ordeal! This is the type of horrible situation that you hear about happening all the time, but which you never think could happen to a monarch you’ve heard of. It’s a sobering reminder that the path to Heaven is dangerous and full of traps, even for the Queen of England! Here’s hoping the Queen’s body finds a way up to Heaven soon, because dangling from a power line is no way to spend the afterlife."
Addressing The Crisis: The Department Of Education Now Recommends That Schools Suffering From A Teacher Shortage Have Their Kids Take Penn & Teller’s Masterclass Instead,N/A,https://clickhole.com/addressing-the-crisis-the-department-of-education-now-recommends-that-schools-suffering-from-a-teacher-shortage-have-their-kids-take-penn-tellers-masterclass-instead/,"Schools across the country are struggling with a crisis-level shortage of teachers, as interest in the profession rapidly declines due to low-pay and exhausting hours. Now, to ease pressure on districts that can’t find enough educators to fill their classrooms, the federal government has stepped in with a much-needed solution: The Department of Education now recommends that schools suffering from a teacher shortage have their kids take Penn & Teller’s Masterclass instead. This is absolutely amazing. While a teacher in every classroom would be ideal, we can be thankful that every school has Penn & Teller’s Masterclass as a backup plan.  In a statement released earlier today, Miguel Cardona, Secretary of the Department of Education, advised public schools facing a shortfall of teachers to enroll students in the “Penn & Teller Teach The Art Of Magic” Masterclass series. The 17-part course, covers the essentials of close-up magic, including sleight of hand card tricks, mentalism, misdirection, and will serve as many children’s entire school curriculum this year, and possibly next year, until such a time as administrators are able to hire enough teachers to fill every classroom. “With the help of Penn & Teller’s thorough explanations of card, coin, and cup-and-ball magic, no child will be deprived of their right to an education as we work to solve our country’s teacher shortage,” explained Cardona, who also recommended that schools spread out the three-hour runtime of the instructional magic series over the course of an entire school year, if possible.  “Fortunately for school districts with strained budgets, the Masterclass only costs $15, which, for a classroom of 20 or more students, is a highly affordable solution, especially when compared to a teacher’s salary and benefits,” Cardona continued. “Until more educators apply for the thousands of teaching positions left unfilled across America, the duo behind the most successful magic residency in Las Vegas will ensure that every last one of our kids graduate with the ability to pull quarters behind people’s ears and make a ball appear under a different cup from the one you thought it was under.” Touting the magic course’s effectiveness as a substitute for actual in-person educators, Cardona cited McGinn Elementary School in New Mexico, where the Penn & Teller Masterclass is currently being implemented until they’re able to hire more teachers. So far, over 80 second grade students at McGinn have reached “Chapter 11: Rope Tricks,” just by sitting together in an adult-free classroom and watching a video monitor playing the Penn & Teller course. While their rudimentary math and writing skills are unfortunately declining, McGinn administrators are reporting that nearly 90% of their second graders are demonstrating proficiency at rope-based magic, such as The Impossible Knot, The Jumping Knot, and one mind-blowing trick where they cut a piece of rope in half and then magically reverse the act, restoring the rope to its original length. We are on our feet and cheering right now! This is bound to be a relief to any school unable to staff their faculties. Let’s hope the teaching profession starts attracting more people soon, but until then, it’s a comfort to know the highest education agency in the U.S. is looking out for our students and giving them the tools they need to amaze and astound!"
True Crime Fans Rejoice: Netflix Has Just Greenlit A New Drama Series About The Families Of Jeffrey Dahmer’s Victims Getting Exploited By Netflix,N/A,https://clickhole.com/true-crime-fans-rejoice-netflix-has-just-greenlit-a-new-drama-series-about-the-families-of-jeffrey-dahmers-victims-getting-exploited-by-netflix/,"If you’re a true crime nut, you’ve undoubtedly already binged Netflix’s latest serial killer opus, Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story, and you’re ready for more. Well, there’s good news on that front, as Netflix has announced they’re working on another deliciously dark drama series that’s all about Netflix’s exploitation of the families of Dahmer’s victims. Badass! Sounds like this one is going to be twisted as hell! “The success of Monster shows that our audience responds strongly to stories based on gruesome real-life events,” said Netflix spokesperson Julia Fields while announcing the new series at a horror festival. “We figured, what could be more dark and disturbing than our own exploitation of the trauma suffered by Dahmer’s living victims and his victims’ surviving family members shown when we produced Monster? So we greenlit a new 8-episode series with the working title, Your Grief Is A Carnival To Us: Netflix’s Exploitation of the Family’s of Jeffrey Dahmer’s Victims.” Inspired by real-life events, the series offers a bleak portrayal of a massive media company showing callous disregard for the families of the victims of a notorious serial killer by depicting the deaths of their loved ones in a streaming series without consulting them, and then continuing to stream and promote the show after those family members pleaded with them to stop. Using Netflix’s experience in dramatic exposés as well as gritty true crime, it promises to deliver a one-two punch of justice served and shameless exploitation. While the series is still currently in production, the buzz around Netflix is that viewers can expect the same harrowing portrayal of unthinkable crimes shown in Monster, only this time instead of Dahmer’s disgusting sex crimes and cannibalism, the focus will be on Netflix’s craven and depraved decision to cash in on the real-life trauma of still-living human beings without consent or compensation. Just like in Monster, the attention to detail will be superb, with Netflix’s victims being portrayed by actors who have uncanny resemblances to their real life counterparts, so the experience of watching them be exploited for the sake of entertainment will be brutally realistic, both for you and them. Wow! If you’re into exploring the dark side of human experience, it sounds like this will be a must-watch! Netflix is on a roll with their ripped-from-the-headlines true crime series, so there’s no doubt this one will be as grimly fascinating as their others. Prepare to watch this one while peeking through your fingers, because watching as Netflix uses real surviving victims of actual crimes as props to make money with no regard for their emotional wellbeing will be truly disturbing and hard to watch. We can’t wait to binge this when it finally starts streaming!"
Give It Up For The King Of Fantasy: George R.R. Martin Just Announced That Instead Of Finishing The Game Of Thrones Books He’s Just Gonna Stay Rich AF And Let These Broke Boys Worry About Dragons,N/A,https://clickhole.com/give-it-up-for-the-king-of-fantasy-george-r-r-martin-just-announced-that-instead-of-finishing-the-game-of-thrones-books-hes-just-gonna-stay-rich-af-and-let-these-broke-boys-worry-about-drag/,"If you’re a Game Of Thrones fan, brace yourself, because the king of fantasy himself just made an announcement you won’t want to miss: instead of finishing the Game Of Thrones books, George R.R. Martin has said he’s just gonna stay rich AF and let these broke boys worry about dragons. Whoa. Even if you were hoping he’d see the series through, you simply have to hand it to him: George is doing him and him only, no matter what his poor haters want! In a statement released through his publisher Harper Collins, George R.R. Martin revealed that he no longer intends to finish The Winds Of Winter, or any other Game Of Thrones books at all for that matter, due to the big league nature of his bank statements. The author explained that he no longer felt the need to “write a fantasy when [I’m] straight up living one,” and that any GoT fans who feel disappointed by his decision to abandon the series should try making “Martin Money” sometime and see if they still care about dragons and swords and peasants that never even existed.  Check out excerpts of Martin’s statement below: “Yeah, so a lot of people (broke boys, almost always) have been asking me, “What’s taking so long for the next book to come out, George? We’ve been waiting forever!” Well, if you really want to know, after years of sitting at my computer, typing up yet another Game Of Thrones book, I realized that my net worth is over $120 million, and that I can do whatever I want and buy whatever I want, whether I finish the series or not. Spending your life worrying about how A Song Of Fire And Ice wraps up is legit poor person behavior. That’s something you only do if you need money. Which I don’t. So, yeah, if you wear Amazon Essentials and spend your free time sweating about dragons I made up in my head, I’ve got bad news for you, ‘cause I’m done with all that. For real. Way done. You worry about dragons, and I don’t worry, because I’m rich as fuck. It’s that simple.” Wow. Just wow. George isn’t even attempting to let his fans down easy. He really is too rich to give a crap! “Tell you what, Winds Of Winter will come out when I need more money to support my lifestyle—which, judging by how nice my bank account is looking right now, is never, ever going to happen. I’m good. I’m set for life. The passive income I make off my side investments is more than you make in a year. I guarantee it. You buy paperback books, I buy real estate. We are not on the same level. When I see your tweets yelling at me all entitled-like, begging me to keep working on the series, all I see is jealousy. You look at me and wish you were me. Just admit it. I see right through you,” continues Martin’s statement, which grows increasingly boastful as the beloved author went on laying into readers who are too poor to ever understand what it’s like to have fuck-you money and then some. “Oh, you enjoy your little book clubs, your Sunday evening get-togethers to watch major-budget shows based on my books? I throw “get-togethers” with my wealth managers and the celebrities who star in my shit (beautiful people, like, gorgeous women who are down to get buck-ass, full-frontal nude for a George R.R. Martin story, ‘cause that’s what people do to get near money like I have). I go to restaurants that charge $2,000 per head, and I don’t blink when I drop my AmEx Platinum, and that’s just lunch. So, yeah, I think I’m gonna keep living the good life and just forget about Westeros and all the idiots who live there forever. Y’all have fun reading escapist fantasy. I don’t need to escape anything. I’ve got money. Real money.” Well, damn. George has officially put the battle for the Iron Throne behind him, and he truly doesn’t care what any of his fans have to say. While it’s sad that his epic series won’t ever get finished, it is nice to see someone unabashedly enjoy the fruits of their labor. Hey, if any fantasy author has earned the right to put down their work and just enjoy success, it’s him. You do you, George!"
Devastating: The 8 Year-Old Terminally Ill Boy Who Received All The Queen’s Organ Donations Has Died,N/A,https://clickhole.com/devastating-the-8-year-old-terminally-ill-boy-who-received-all-the-queens-organ-donations-has-died/,"If you’re still mourning Queen Elizabeth II, prepare to have your heart broken all over again, because Buckingham Palace has just released this absolutely tragic news: The 8 year-old terminally ill boy who received all the Queen’s organ donations has died. It simply does not get more devastating than this. May that child rest in peace. Marcus Bullmore, the cancer-stricken 8 year-old who received organ donations from the late Queen Elizabeth—including her pancreas, eyeballs, kidney, liver, face, vocal chords, heart, intestines, hands, feet, brain, toes, skull, and lungs—was declared dead by physicians at St. John’s Hospice in Doncaster, England, at approximately 6:28am GMT today. Following a year of ineffective chemotherapy treatments and looming signs of organ failure, Marcus’ prospects were revitalized in light of the Queen’s passing on September 8th, when the entirety of her 96 year-old remains were raced to Doncaster as Marcus was green-lit for a transplant procedure that ended up lasting over 30 minutes. Surgeons initially reported the operation to be a success, explaining that they’d “used every part of the buffalo” to give Marcus a fighting chance, and praised the Queen’s selfless decision to “put her guts up for grabs.” But Marcus’ hopes were short-lived.  After briefly waking up and attempting to sing “God Save The Queen” as a gesture of gratitude for Her Majesty’s organs, Marcus fell unconscious just two lines in, and was put on life support until he finally passed this morning. “We did the best we could, but ultimately, all of Queen Elizabeth’s organs, both vital and non-vital, were rejected by Marcus’s 8 year-old body,” said pediatric surgeon Dr. Emily Nagourney, in a statement to the press. “For a moment, it really seemed like Marcus was going to make it, and that he’d be able to live out a happy, healthy childhood with the internal and external organs of a nearly 100-year old woman. However, the Lord had other plans for Marcus. Fortunately, we were able to recover all the Queen’s organs, which are now being preserved until a new recipient is identified and approved for transplant. May her legacy carry on as gracefully as she ruled.” What a gut-wrenching loss. The thought that an 8 year-old boy would be able to live due to the Queen’s anatomical generosity made her death a little easier to swallow. But today, the silver lining around that cloud has dimmed to a black body bag.  Rest in peace, Marcus. Our thoughts are with his family and friends today. We can only hope the next child to receive all her organs has better luck than he did."
Walking A Righteous Path: This Man Has Only Touched 2 Of The Bras On The Mannequins At Target,N/A,https://clickhole.com/walking-a-righteous-path-this-man-has-only-touched-2-of-the-bras-on-the-mannequins-at-target/,"Here’s an inspiring story about an absolute saint whose moral courage was strong enough to keep him on the righteous path in the face of dark temptation: This man has only touched two of the bras on the mannequins at Target. Huzzah! Well done, sir! Although the aisles of department stores like Target are strewn with a dozen or so mannequins displaying highly alluring bras right in the center of the store, today we celebrate Keith Haggerman, age 42, who made it through his recent shopping trip having touched merely two of the bras, and squeezing the breast part of just one. While many weaker men would surely succomb to the overwhelming temptation and lose hours of their day running their palms over the lacy fabric, after just three minutes with his hands on the undergarments, Keith was able to look his lust in the eye and say, “Get lost.” Truly inspiring. Let this man’s moral fortitude be an example to all! It certainly takes a man a great deal of self-reliance and bravery to exit the women’s underwear department at Target with his honor and dignity intact, but that’s exactly how Keith walked out of there, with only one pair of silk, high-waisted panties tucked into the back of his cart so he could steal a few more glances at it before he left. While not everyone has what it takes to resist the sensual temptations of brands like Maidenform and Jockey, with their intimates in loud, garish colors like white, nude, and black, it’s clear that Keith is one of the few incorruptible men who does, with only minor exceptions! Keith, you have truly raised the bar for how an upstanding gentleman should act. Conducting yourself with such honor is no easy feat when you’re surrounded by the siren song of such gorgeous bras and underwear. Bravo, Keith, bravo! Paradise surely awaits your pristine, temperate soul in the hereafter!"
Hard To Watch: Connie Britton Is Trying To Get In On The Trend Of Celebrity-Owned Liquor With A New Line Of Vodka-Soaked Tampons,N/A,https://clickhole.com/hard-to-watch-connie-britton-is-trying-to-get-in-on-the-trend-of-celebrity-owned-liquor-with-a-new-line-of-vodka-soaked-tampons/,"Whether it’s Kendall Jenner’s tequila, Ryan Reynold’s gin, or Matthew McConaughey’s whiskey, celebrity-owned liquor brands have been a major trend these last few years. The newest celeb to throw her hat in the wine and spirits ring is an international star, but her botched efforts are pretty hard to watch: Connie Britton is trying to get in on the trend of celebrity-owned liquor with a new line of vodka-soaked tampons. C’mon, Connie. You know you can do better than this. According to an announcement posted on her Instagram earlier this week, Connie Britton has launched a line of vodka-soaked tampons, and from the looks of it, she seems to be running the entire operation herself. The social media post features a photo of the White Lotus actress wearing a pair of Speedo swimming goggles while dunking cardboard tampons into a bowl of Kirkland-brand vodka and placing them into a Ziploc baggie. As the post’s caption explains, “There’s nothing like a crisp cocktail at the end of a long day, but sometimes, you don’t want to drink it. You just want to feel it. From your vagina. That’s why I’m so proud to say that Connie’s Vadka [sic] Tampons are now available exclusively on Facebook Marketplace.” Yikes. It looks like the Friday Night Lights actress has made a pretty severe error in judgment here. In a video advertisement for her new and woefully misguided product, Connie can be seen stumbling around a packed bar and colliding with multiple people before turning to the camera and saying, “Woo-wee, I’m drunk as hell! But I haven’t had a sip. How’d I do it?” She then holds up a plastic bag full of sopping wet tampons with “Connie’s Vadka [sic] Tampons” written on it in marker. “My tampons are a totally safe and fun way to get wasted, though to be clear, if they make your body go nutso, you can’t sue me,” a statement that, according to legal experts, is not going to hold up in court if she does get sued. Connie concludes the video by saying, “Not everyone has a vagina. But probably everyone has an asshole,” before winking to the camera, which, regretfully, seems to be the main catchphrase she’s going with for the product, because the phrase has been printed on billboards all across New York City. Good Lord. This is so upsetting to see. Surely Connie could have figured out a way to create her own liquor brand without stooping to such a sad level. Here’s hoping Connie rebounds with a better idea once this vodka-soaked tampon company is inevitably shut down."
Bold Move: ‘Highlights Magazine’ Is Attempting To Boost Sales By Featuring Goofus And Gallant In Skimpy Bikinis,N/A,https://clickhole.com/bold-move-highlights-magazine-is-attempting-to-boost-sales-by-featuring-goofus-and-gallant-in-skimpy-bikinis/,"As media becomes more and more tech-dominated, print publications are struggling to stay afloat, which may be why one beloved magazine is now trying to lure customers with sexy, provocative cover imagery: Highlights Magazine is attempting to boost sales by featuring Goofus and Gallant in skimpy bikinis. Wow. This is a bold marketing move! In a departure from their typical cover design, Highlights Magazine has just unveiled an image for this month’s issue that depicts Highlights characters Goofus and Gallant—twin boys whose behavior is meant to teach kids about right and wrong—wearing tiny string bikinis. The cover advertises Highlight’s “Reading Issue,” but rather than a simple cover image featuring books or fully clothed children reading in a library, the artwork shows Goofus and Gallant in a larger version of their typical two-panel cartoon. On the left side, Goofus leans against a library wall in a revealing polka dot swimsuit, placing a piece of chewing gum inside a library book above a caption that reads “Goofus damages his library books.” A caption reading “Gallant treats his library books with respect” describes the righthand image, which depicts Gallant handing a pristine book to the librarian, smiling in a strapless bandeau top and high-cut bikini bottoms. The people at Highlights clearly aren’t afraid to take some big risks, because it sounds incredibly risqué! We have to imagine it is going to catch some eyes in the checkout line at the grocery store. Readers lured in by this month’s flashy cover will be treated to more bikini-clad Goofus and Gallant images in the issue’s regular Goofus and Gallant strip, which teaches kids about proper beach behavior. The comic has Goofus lazing on a towel and sipping a soda while sporting a revealing cheeky two piece, captioned “Goofus spends his summer lying around.” In contrast, Gallant is shown running down the beach and towards a drowning child in a barely there lifeguard suit, above the caption “Gallant uses his time off from school to help others.” You’ve got to hand it to Highlights—this is a seriously big swing, and it very well may pay off. We’re excited to see how sales go for the magazine this month now that Goofus and Gallant are showing some serious skin in their skimpy two-pieces. It’s the kind of bold, boundary pushing marketing that really makes waves in the competitive world of publishing, and we have no choice but to applaud the bravery and innovation!"
LIVE UPDATES: The Dalai Lama Is At Spencer’s Looking At All The Lava Lamps,N/A,https://clickhole.com/live-updates-the-dalai-lama-is-at-spencers-looking-at-all-the-lava-lamps/,"Folks, it’s happening: the Dalai Lama has just been spotted perusing all the lava lamps on display at a Spencer’s Gifts in Zanesville, Ohio, a momentous occasion marking the very first incarnation of the Dalai Lama to visit a Spencer’s. From the initial sighting to up-to-the-minute reporting, ClickHole is on location bringing you moment-by-moment coverage of the Tibetan spiritual leader’s shopping experience at Spencer’s. REPORTING LIVE: 4:52am EST The Dalai Lama has arrived at the Colony Square shopping center via an Uber XL, pre-dawn, with his entourage of translators, personal assistants, and security guards in company. He’s smiling and waving to an unoccupied minivan as he slowly crosses the otherwise empty parking lot towards Spencer’s Gifts. UPDATE: 4:55am EST The Dalai Lama’s knocking on the glass door at Spencer’s. It is closed. His entourage waits behind him, hands clasped, heads bowed. UPDATE: 7:42am EST The sun has risen. The Dalai Lama’s still knocking on the entrance door for Spencer’s, his patience unwavered in the slightest.  UPDATE: 10:27am EST The manager of this Spencer’s Gifts location has approached the storefront. As the Dalai Lama’s entourage parts to allow her forward, the Spencer’s Gifts manager, Tina-Lynn, 32, has greeted the Dalai Lama with a bow, avoiding eye contact out of respect as she presents him with two items for him to bless: Spencer’s-brand anal beads and a novelty t-shirt featuring a nun in sunglasses with her middle fingers raised. Addressing him as “Your Holiness”, she’s just informed the Dalai Lama that the store will not be open for another half-hour. The Dalai Lama is nodding as Tina-Lynn enters the store, locking the door behind her. The Dalai Lama now continues waiting and knocking. UPDATE: 11:00am EST Spencer’s Gifts opens. The Dalai Lama and his entourage have entered the store, and are heading directly to the lava lamp section, where seven marginally different varieties of lava lamp are lit up on display.  UPDATE: 11:02am EST The Dalai Lama is now contemplatively watching the floating orbs of melted wax inside the lamps as they stretch, melt apart, and recombine. He appears quite calmed by the lamps. UPDATE: 11:08am EST The Dalai Lama just burned a finger on one of the lava lamps.  UPDATE: 11:10am EST The Dalai Lama has briefly stepped away from the lava lamps to bless a 13 year-old Spencer’s customer in the gag gift aisle. “Money, success, fame…these things will not bring you the complete happiness that a testicle keychain or a prank pregnancy test will,” the Dalai Lama had his translator tell the young teenager.  UPDATE: 11:15am EST While examining a lava lamp featuring a tie-dye pattern on its metal base, the Dalai Lama whistled and raised his eyebrows at the $39.99 price tag.  UPDATE: 11:19am EST The Dalai Lama just burned the same finger on the same lava lamp again.  UPDATE: 11:23am EST The Dalai Lama is having a personal assistant tweet from his official Twitter account, “To discover peace of mind, we must cultivate compassion for other human beings—to charge your fellow man $39.99 for a beautiful lava lamp is an example of a lack of compassion, and it goes against everything I stand for.”   UPDATE: 11:27am EST One of the Dalai Lama’s monk attendants, who had been perusing a rack of edible undies in an adjacent aisle, has discovered a life-size Chucky doll and brought it to the attention of His Holiness. The Dalai Lama is now cradling the Chucky doll as his translator informs a Spencer’s cashier that “[the Dalai Lama] would like to rescue this malnourished orphan,” and take it to “a Tibetan monastery to be raised under Buddhist teachings.”  UPDATE: 11:28am EST
The Dalai Lama has returned to the lava lamp section, while a personal assistant has begun to shave the Chucky doll’s head and dress it in a red and gold monastic robe.  UPDATE: 11:29am EST The Dalai Lama has removed his glasses and is staring into a lava lamp from mere centimeters away. UPDATE: 11:30am EST The Dalai Lama just singed his forehead on a lava lamp. UPDATE: 11:35am EST The Dalai Lama has reached a decision: he’s selected a blue lava lamp with a pattern of purple skulls decorating its base. It’s priced at $34.99. His attendants have taken the lava lamp to the cash register. UPDATE: 11:36am EST The Dalai Lama has had an assistant post another tweet from his Twitter account: “I have purchased a lava lamp for $34.99, a very reasonable price for a lava lamp. It is wonderful to look at. Thank you @Spencers, for promoting happiness in others, the ultimate human purpose.” UPDATE: 12:15pm EST After waiting over 30 minutes outside Spencer’s Gifts for another Uber XL to arrive, the Dalai Lama and his entourage have departed back to the airport, where they will return to Tibet following a 9 hour lay-over at LaGuardia Airport in Queens, New York. Wow. What a historic moment to witness unfolding in real time!  Whether this incarnation of the Dalai Lama will ever return to a Spencer’s Gifts remains to be seen. All we know for sure is that he really seems to have been moved by his experience at Spencer’s, and we’d bet that Spencer’s employees feel the same. Awesome!"
A Piece Of History: The 3D-Printed Gun That JFK Accidentally Shot Himself With While Making A 3D Printing YouTube Explainer For ‘Vice’ Is Coming To The Smithsonian,N/A,https://clickhole.com/a-piece-of-history-the-3d-printed-gun-that-jfk-accidentally-shot-himself-with-while-making-a-3d-printing-youtube-explainer-for-vice-is-coming-to-the-smithsonian/,"John F. Kennedy was not just a U.S. president, but also a cultural icon, and his untimely death has been the subject of horror and fascination for many generations of Americans. Now, a new Washington D.C. exhibit will offer a whole new glimpse into the President’s fateful demise that will likely leave museumgoers shocked and transfixed: The 3D-printed gun that JFK accidentally shot himself with while making a 3D printing YouTube explainer for Vice is coming to the Smithsonian. Wow. We absolutely can’t wait to see this incredible piece of history. According to curators at the Smithsonian, a brand-new exhibit on JFK’s death will feature the original handgun that he designed, printed, and accidentally used to shoot himself while co-hosting a video on 3D printing technology with a lanky, bespectacled 26-year-old named Graham during his first month as a Vice correspondent. Visitors will have the chance to watch the video itself before viewing the firearm. In the 19-minute YouTube upload, JFK and Graham can be seen discussing thermoplastics and the Second Amendment with an intimidating 3D printing expert and gun rights activist over jaunty electronic music. This conversation is intercut with time-lapse footage of a 3D printer spitting out the bright white plastic gun destined to end the President’s life mere minutes later. The climactic moment of the video, which Vice editors chose to include for the sake of verisimilitude, comes after Graham and JFK hop in the printing expert’s Camry and drive out to a rural gun range. There, the amused laughs of the range’s regulars turn to screams of horror as JFK aims the 3D-printed gun at a target and says, “How the hell do I operate this thing?” The president then points his homemade firearm directly at his face and pulls the trigger. Many older visitors to the exhibit will recognize the handgun itself from the time they first saw it in the video, which was posted to YouTube the day after the President Kennedy’s death, and inspired millions of devastated comments from grieving Americans. A nearby plaque explains how the site crashed for several minutes that day due to the volume of viewers rushing to write “RIP the prez” and express condolences to Jackie Kennedy Onassis, who had originally encouraged JFK to look for a job at Vice due to his “passion for social issues.” Though the handgun appears relatively normal aside from its bright color and plasticky sheen, there remains a great deal of blood spatter that ricocheted back onto the weapon as Kennedy blasted his head off before a shocked group of civilians. Many of the witnesses at the gun range that day were interviewed for the Vice video, and express the sentiment that though JFK seemed excited about learning about the world of guns and 3D printing, he also appeared to believe that the gun itself was “just a toy” because, in the president’s words, it “looked like fun” and “came out of the computer all freaky like in a movie.” This is so exciting! We can’t wait for Americans to delve into this incredibly immersive exhibit about one of the most pivotal moments in our country’s history. Get your tickets while they’re still available, because an opportunity to see such an significant artifact in person only comes around once in a lifetime!"
He Must Really Suck: This Kid Just Got Cut From The JV Basketball Team To Make A Spot For Skyler Gisondo,N/A,https://clickhole.com/he-must-really-suck-this-kid-just-got-cut-from-the-jv-basketball-team-to-make-a-spot-for-skyler-gisondo/,"Getting cut from a sports team in middle school always stings, but there are some circumstances that might make it hurt even more. Case in point: This kid just got cut from the JV basketball team to make a spot for Skyler Gisondo.  Yikes. That kid’s got to be pretty bad if they replaced him with a niche actor who doesn’t even go to the school. Last week, 12-year-old Freddie McDermott excitedly came home from school reporting that he’d made the Altoona Middle School junior varsity basketball team, but unfortunately, at yesterday’s practice, Freddie was informed by his coach that he’d been cut to make room for Booksmart actor Skyler Gisondo, who, as far as we know, isn’t especially good at basketball.  Despite the fact that Skyler Gisondo can only attend two of Altoona’s JV games this year because he’s currently shooting the next season of Righteous Gemstones in South Carolina, the coach still felt that he’d be a better addition to the team than Freddie, an actual student at the school who would be able to attend all the practices and games. In middle school sports, and especially on the JV squad, there’s usually like half a dozen kids per team who just sit on the bench and never play, so the fact that this coach would rather have an actor who’ll almost always be absent on the roster is a pretty devastating indictment of Freddie’s basketball abilities.  Damn. You know how bad you’ve got to be that the coach wouldn’t even offer to let you be the manager, and instead just boot you from the team completely in favor of the guy who played “Young Moe” in the Three Stooges movie? This is just heartbreaking. And it’s not like there’s a clear height difference here either! Skyler Gisondo is 5’7”, whereas Freddie’s only 5’6”, but the truth of the matter is that that extra inch isn’t going to matter much during these middle school games when pretty much everyone is that height anyway. And while the coach defended his decision by saying that Skyler Gisondo leaves it all on the paint, when Freddie asked when Skyler Gisondo even tried out for the team, it became clear that the coach had never seen Skyler Gisondo play basketball, but rather decided he’d be good at it while watching Skyler Gisondo’s performance in Licorice Pizza. This information tragically proved what Freddie most feared to be true: that the coach’s decision wasn’t about what a good basketball player Skyler Gisondo is, but just about how much Freddie sucks. Woof. Here’s hoping Freddie finds some other after school activity to take part in, because it’s clearly not going to be basketball. If the coach is choosing Skyler Gisondo over him, then Freddie’s future in this sport looks pretty bleak indeed."
"Not A Sad Time, But A Joyful One: The Horse We’ve Been Training To Skydive Has Returned To The Arms Of The Lord",N/A,https://clickhole.com/not-a-sad-time-but-a-joyful-one-the-horse-weve-been-training-to-skydive-has-returned-to-the-arms-of-the-lord/,"Do not weep when we tell you of this sudden passing, but rather rejoice and give thanks, because a cherished friend has departed from this world for a most joyful reunion with our Creator: The horse we’ve been training to skydive has returned to the arms of the Lord. Hallelujah, hallelujah, our horse has come to his eternal reward in the glorious Kingdom of Heaven! Yesterday, we unexpectedly said goodbye to born entertainer and all-around good horse Rutherford B. Hooves, the Inimitable Stallion of the Skies, who with just a little more time and training might have one day been known across the world as the only horse who could skydive. Yet far from feeling sorrow, we’re feeling content and even a bit celebratory today, because Rutherford’s eternal spirit now resides in the loving embrace of our Almighty Lord where he shall receive God’s divine grace forever and ever. How blessed is he to ascend higher than any skydive could ever take him, and how blessed are we to know our equine pupil now kneels before the throne of Christ Jesus at the right hand of God the Father in his everlasting Kingdom! Looking back, we think Rutherford must have known the hour of his reunion with the Lord was nigh upon him. While in the past he had been anxious and fidgety whenever we took him up in the Cessna to get him acclimated to high altitudes, he’d seemed calm and strangely at peace on our last couple practice flights. At the time we chalked this up to his growing familiar with the cramped plane interior and loud rumble of the engine, but now we’re certain he felt the holy presence of the Lord he was soon to meet. He’d also seemed unusually preoccupied during the skydiving instructional videos we’d play for him at half speed so his horse brain could have extra time to process them, even though we would always hang a carrot between him and the screen to keep him looking in the right direction. But again, what horse could concern himself with such mundane affairs knowing that God’s glory was soon to be his in paradise? God is truly great, and He has called back His faithful servant. Praise be to Him on this triumphant day! We’ll always cherish the time we spent training Rutherford to skydive: The sugar cubes we’d give him for successfully pulling a ripcord with his teeth, the way he’d stare blankly at us while we explained how to execute a hook turn with his canopy, the quiet evenings brushing him after a long day practicing free fall stability in a vertical wind tunnel. And someday soon, once we’ve cleaned off and done some troubleshooting on the prototype horse parachute God Himself revealed to us in a vision, we know Rutherford will watch over the next horse we find to continue his life’s work of becoming the first horse on earth who can skydive. In Jesus’s name, we bid you be jubilant! Though we wish we could have seen Rutherford perform one successful skydive before he left us, his entrance to heaven is the greatest victory that we as his trainers could ever win. Thanks be to God, Amen!"
Yikes: Ruth’s Chris Steakhouse Is Going Apeshit On Twitter Threatening To Make Their Name Even More Confusing If People Don’t Shut The Fuck Up About It,N/A,https://clickhole.com/yikes-ruths-chris-steakhouse-is-going-apeshit-on-twitter-threatening-to-make-their-name-even-more-confusing-if-people-dont-shut-the-fuck-up-about-it/,"A major restaurant company is have a full-blown public meltdown right now, and it’s honestly pretty hard to watch: Ruth’s Chris Steakhouse is going apeshit on Twitter threatening to make their name even more confusing if people don’t shut the fuck up about it. Jeez. It seems like people finally pushed the people at Ruth’s Chris over the edge. The chain of over 100 steakhouses took to Twitter this morning to berate its fans and customers for making jokes about the name “Ruth’s Chris Steakhouse,” which many claim is a confusing construction that’s nearly impossible to understand. Ruth’s Chris was clearly not having it, and their social media tantrum reached pretty epic proportions.  Check out the tweets below.  Wow. That was truly a Twitter meltdown for the ages. What do you think: Are you still annoyed that Ruth’s Chris is a weird name for a steakhouse, or did they successfully put you in your place?"
Out Of Touch: Gwyneth Paltrow Is Flaunting Her Purse Full Of Beans While Millions Of Americans Remain Beanless,N/A,https://clickhole.com/out-of-touch-gwyneth-paltrow-is-flaunting-her-purse-full-of-beans-while-millions-of-americans-remain-beanless/,"It’s no secret that the rich inhabit a very different world than the rest of us, and one particularly tone-deaf celeb has been unwittingly demonstrating just how disconnected from other people success can make you: Gwyneth Paltrow is flaunting her purse full of beans while millions of Americans remain beanless. Yes, your purse has a lot of beans in it, but read the room, Gwyneth! At a time when record numbers of Americans don’t have a single bean to their name, ostentatious displays of one’s own beans come across as pretty tasteless, but that hasn’t stopped actress-cum-entrepreneur Gwyneth Paltrow from embarking on a personal mission to make sure everyone on earth knows just how many beans she has in her purse. Whether it’s posting Instagram photos with the hashtag ‘#PurseLadenWithManyBeansMondays’ or going on podcasts to demonstrate the swishing sound the beans make in her purse while she walks, Paltrow seems physically incapable of just quietly enjoying the beans she’s amassed in her purse without rubbing everyone’s faces in it. It’s genuinely galling how much narcissism Paltrow displays toward bean issues in the United States. A normal person might look at a purse stuffed with beans and ask, “How can I help get these beans to people who don’t have any?” but Paltrow sees the exact same purse and tweets about how she’s going to replace the original strap with a padded guitar strap so her shoulder can better accommodate the weight of even more beans. Yikes. Imagine being the kind of person who hoards beans like that and thinks it’s something to be proud of. It’s truly mind-boggling that someone can be this obtuse. Here’s hoping Paltrow gets a clue and actually does something meaningful to address beanlessness in our country instead of continuing to just blithely parade her purse full of beans around like an asshole!"
So Cool: Amazon’s ‘Lord Of The Rings’ Show Features A Cameo By Jeff Bezos Playing A Hobbit That Gets Wrapped In Foil By A Troll And Cooked In A Campfire Like A Potato,N/A,https://clickhole.com/so-cool-amazons-lord-of-the-rings-show-features-a-cameo-by-jeff-bezos-playing-a-hobbit-that-gets-wrapped-in-foil-by-a-troll-and-cooked-in-a-campfire-like-a-potato/,"If you’ve been watching Amazon Prime’s new Lord Of The Rings show, you’ll want to know about this amazing, blink-and-you’ll-miss-it appearance by Amazon’s very own CEO: The Rings Of Power features a cameo by Jeff Bezos as a Hobbit who a troll wraps in foil and cooks in a campfire like a potato.  This is so awesome! As if this show wasn’t epic enough! The amazing Easter egg occurs about halfway into the latest Rings Of Power episode, when Galadriel’s nighttime journey through a forest is interrupted when she encounters the camp of a gigantic, hideous troll, where a hobbit, played by none other than Amazon founder, Jeff Bezos, is being buttered up, wrapped in aluminum foil, and baked alive in hot coals like a campfire potato. Peering out from behind a tree, Galadriel briefly makes eye contact with the Bezos Hobbit, who simply smiles and waves to her as the grunting troll unspools a Hobbit-length piece of Reynolds Wrap-brand aluminum foil and wraps it around Bezos. With the troll sufficiently distracted for Galadriel to pass by undetected—and the Bezos Hobbit not protesting or making any indications whatsoever that he’d like to be rescued, just bobbing his head and lightly humming to himself—the Elven warrior mutters, “Interesting. Looks like a troll’s going to cook that Hobbit like a potato. I don’t have time to care about that.” Galadriel then flees the troll’s camp to continue her journey.  Moments later, the troll finishes wrapping the Bezos Hobbit, pokes a few ventilation holes into the foil, and unceremoniously dumps the foil-covered Hobbit into a crackling campfire. Immediately, the Jeff Bezos Hobbit starts to emit terrible, high-pitched shrieks of agony, which seem to echo throughout all Middle-earth as the camera follows campfire sparks floating into the night sky, drifting high above the forest canopy. The scene then cuts to an elf village hundreds of miles in the distance, where several elves eating dinner together suddenly hear Bezos’ blood-curdling screeches. “Sounds like a troll cooking a Hobbit like a potato,” remarks an elder elf through a full mouth, without much concern or interest. Wow! If you’re a Lord Of The Rings fan, it really doesn’t get cooler than this! Leave it to a visionary like Jeff Bezos to add “cameo as a Hobbit that gets roasted alive, like a potato” to his incredible resume! He’s living every Lord Of The Ring fanatic’s dream, and as the person whose money brought this beautiful show to life, he deserves a moment in the spotlight like this. If you’re not watching Rings Of Power, this moment alone should convince you to binge it ASAP!"
"Getting Aggressive: Duolingo Is Sending You Notifications Saying That If You Keep Skipping Your Welsh Lessons, You’ll Have No Career Options Besides Shit Shoveler When The Welsh Take Over",N/A,https://clickhole.com/getting-aggressive-duolingo-is-sending-you-notifications-saying-that-if-you-keep-skipping-your-welsh-lessons-youll-have-no-career-options-besides-shit-shoveler-when-the-welsh-take-over/,"It’s not unheard of for people learning a new skill to occasionally fall behind in their lessons, but one popular language learning company is taking an unusually aggressive approach to bringing their lapsed users back: Duolingo is sending you notifications saying that if you keep skipping your Welsh lessons, you’ll have no career options besides shit shoveler when the Welsh take over. Jeez, Duolingo’s really going for the jugular here! We’re used to Duolingo encouraging or even mildly guilting us to get back in the habit of taking their lessons whenever we temporarily miss a few, but we’ve been a little taken aback by the new notifications we’ve been receiving that imply that our failure to regularly take Welsh lessons will forever relegate you to a thankless existence mucking out shit in a Welsh-dominated future. According to Duolingo, any career aspirations your English-speaking ass may have had will go right out the window once the current world powers are laid low by an ascendant Wales and Welsh becomes the main tongue of the land. Duolingo users have been receiving multiple emails a day from the app warning them that unless they get back in the saddle with their Welsh language program soon, the unstoppable Welsh tide will leave them in the ash heap of history and afford them no opportunities for employment beyond laboriously moving wet mounds of dung until the day you finally keel over into the shit mire and die. These reminder messages used to at worst suggest that you were making a cartoon owl kind of sad, so it’s a pretty major escalation for them to now say things like, “Staying out of the shit bog requires practicing Welsh every day,” or “When the Red Dragon spreads its wings above North America, you will rue the day you abandoned your Unit 3 Welsh Prepositional Phrases lesson!” We understand the importance of regular reinforcement when learning a new language, of course, but it seems unnecessarily harsh for them to tell you that from your future vantage point at the bottom of a cesspit in the Welsh American Territories, you will look at your friends who died in the bloody Campaign of Welsh Dominion and see them as the lucky ones. Man, Duolingo’s not playing around anymore. We’d never even considered learning Welsh before this, but after seeing Duolingo’s warnings of what a Welsh-ruled future will be like for non-Welsh speakers, we’re starting to think we can’t afford not to. We’re definitely going to be diligent about completing our Welsh lessons from here on out!"
Honoring A Legend: This Week’s ‘She-Hulk’ Episode Features A Stan Lee Cameo Where His Corpse Comes Flying Out Of The Open Sunroof Of A Minivan That She-Hulk Throws At A Nun,N/A,https://clickhole.com/honoring-a-legend-this-weeks-she-hulk-episode-features-a-stan-lee-cameo-where-his-corpse-comes-flying-out-of-the-open-sunroof-of-a-minivan-that-she-hulk-throws-at-a-nun/,"If you’re a Marvel fan, you’re definitely going to want to head over to Disney+ ASAP, because one show just paid an incredible tribute to one of the greatest creators in comics history: This week’s episode of She-Hulk: Attorney At Law features a Stan Lee cameo where his corpse comes flying out of the open sunroof of a minivan that She-Hulk throws at a nun. This is seriously amazing! What an incredible way to honor Stan Lee and his contributions to the Marvel universe! About halfway through this week’s new episode of She-Hulk, the series protagonist Jennifer Walters, aka She-Hulk, is walking into the prestigious law firm where she works when she sees a nun walking by on the other side of the street. Jennifer mumbles, “There’s the hag.” She then transforms into She-Hulk and uses her super strength to grab a minivan parked nearby, lift it over her head, and hurl it at the nun, who screams, “You’ll never kill me, Muscle Witch! I’m protected by Christ!” The minivan then lands on top of the nun (killing her instantly) and upon impact the corpse of Stan Lee himself comes rocketing out of the minivan’s sunroof and flies through the air like a rag doll for about 20 feet before crashing to the ground, where he lies spread eagle and motionless on the sidewalk. It’s such a badass, emotional moment to see the father of Marvel Comics make another incredible cameo appearance in the MCU! The folks at Marvel are truly coming through with some god-tier fan service with this one. After Stan Lee’s corpse has been lying on the ground for a few seconds, a police officer approaches the lifeless Marvel legend, points at him, and says, “This is that evil zookeeper we’ve been trying to arrest for months. The one who lied to all the animals.” The police officer then puts Stan Lee’s corpse in handcuffs, throws him in the trunk of his patrol car, and drives away while Marvel fans all over the world stand up and cheer for one of the greatest comics creators of all time! Other franchises take note: this is how you acknowledge a legend in your field! If you’re not crying with happiness right now then you’re not a real Marvel fan! We can’t wait to see what other awesome Marvel easter eggs She-Hulk has in store for us in upcoming episodes. Keep on watching television, and as Stan Lee would say, “Excelsior!”"
"Walk On Eggshells Today: Your Boss Just Came To Work With A Way Smaller Head, Like It Definitely Shrunk Over The Weekend, And He Clearly Doesn’t Want To Talk About It",N/A,https://clickhole.com/walk-on-eggshells-today-your-boss-just-came-to-work-with-a-way-smaller-head-like-it-definitely-shrunk-over-the-weekend-and-he-clearly-doesnt-want-to-walk-about-it/,"Hopefully you had a relaxing weekend away from work, because today’s set to be a tense, tense day at the office: your boss just came to work with a way smaller head—like, it definitely shrunk over the weekend—and it’s abundantly clear that he does not want to talk about it. Yikes…his head’s noticeably way smaller than it was on Friday, and he does NOT look happy about it. Tread lightly today. And don’t stare if you can help it. The work day had started like any other, until the moment your boss came trudging out of the elevator with a brooding scowl, and the sight of his 40-50% smaller head sucked the air out of the entire building. Silently marching past your coworkers’ cubicles and avoiding eye contact with everyone doing a double-take at his now grapefruit-sized head, your boss quickly shut the door to his corner office and drew the blinds right before his secretary responded to your concerned glare with a wide-eyed head shake that communicated, “I don’t know, and I’m not asking.” A frenzy of hushed whispering and private Slack-messaging about your boss’s tinier head soon began, increasing tenfold after everyone heard him scream “GOD DAMN IT!” and a loud slam from inside his office, like he’d punched a wall or kicked his desk or something. Your boss is doing a terrible job hiding how insecure he feels about the reduced size of his head. And unfortunately, he should feel insecure…it’s like every part of his skull shrunk except his hair, like his eyebrows and hair are the same length as they were on Friday, but on a far smaller face and scalp. Like an infant wearing a Party City Elvis wig. It just looks awful. It really does, and considering that he’s got a meeting with one of his biggest clients today, it’s making his rotten mood exponentially worse. No one’s resigning a contract with a guy who looks like that, and he knows it. Yeah, if you needed anything from your boss today, take a raincheck. This is not the day to put more work on his plate or ask for favors.  As if the office’s atmosphere wasn’t agitated enough, it’s somehow deteriorated much, much further over the past 20 minutes. He went to the break room for coffee while wearing a normal-sized baseball cap, clearly intended to distract from his dwindled noggin, and ended up putting everyone nearby on edge as he violently cursed under his breath and clenched his teeth every time the hat slid so far down it covered his whole face, which it did constantly, because it was simply way too large for his baby head. But then, when the office manager made a stilted attempt to break the ice and make small talk with your boss, he cut her off and basically exploded on her. “How was my weekend? Oh, my weekend was fucking fine. Probably not as good as yours, I’d bet! Any particular reason you’re asking? Hmm?” your boss barked at the office manager, before quickly apologizing and blushing so hard his tiny head looked like an overplump pomegranate. How in the world is this man going to lead a client meeting today when his head’s so weirdly small and he’s this deeply upset about it? The meeting’s literally in 30 minutes…we’re already crawling out of our skin imagining how unpleasant sitting through that’s going to be. Oh god…according to a Slack message your gossipy coworker sent you, your boss apparently has to have an HR meeting for snapping at the office manager. Literally the last thing he, or anyone who has to work with your boss—like YOU—needed right now. All you can do is walk on eggshells around him and brace yourself for a legendarily awful day at work. Fingers crossed your boss’s head returns to normal soon, because this is unbearable."
"Disappointing: This ‘Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles’ Superfan Left 4 Turtles In The Sewer, And While They Did Mutate, Learn Martial Arts, And Befriend A Large Rat, They Are Ambivalent Towards Pizza And Speak Like Southern Dandies",N/A,https://clickhole.com/disappointing-this-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-superfan-left-4-turtles-in-the-sewer-and-while-they-did-mutate-learn-martial-arts-and-befriend-a-large-rat-they-are-ambivalent-towards-pizza-an/,"If you grew up loving Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, be thankful you aren’t this New York City resident, who just had the biggest letdown a TMNT fan could possibly experience: This TMNT superfan left four turtles in the sewer, and while they did mutate, learn martial arts, and befriend a large rat, they are ambivalent towards pizza and speak like southern dandies.  God, that’s disappointing. If crime-fighting turtles speak like refined southern gentlemen and have mixed feelings about pizza, it just isn’t the same as the real thing, is it?  Mark Harris, 31, an avid collector of all things TMNT since childhood, had taken his Ninja Turtles fandom to the next level: he attempted to create real-life versions of Leonardo, Michaelangelo, Raphael, and Donatello by dropping four turtles into an open manhole in downtown Manhattan. The next day, to his utter joy, four humanoid turtles emerged from a sewer grate brandishing Japanese weaponry, followed by a gigantic, 6’0 tall rat who Mark assumed was none other than their sensei Splinter. However, Mark’s excitement was cut short when the turtles began speaking in fanciful southern drawls as they equivocated over the pizzas he’d brought them, instead of shouting “Cowabunga!” and scarfing down entire slices whole like he thought they would.  “I do declare, I feel deeply conflicted in regards to the tomato and cheese delicacies that you have so considerately offered for our consumption, for as good as they may taste and as hungry as I am, they can indeed burn the tongue if consumed at too a high a temperature, a suffering I have no desire to experience—though, perhaps our rodential guest would care for some savory pie?” said Leonardo, using one of his katanas to gesture to the massive rat that had followed them out of the sewer, while fanning himself with the other katana. “Heavens, pizza in this Northern heat? Why, a mint julep would make this Ninja Turtle as happy as a hog in a wallow, far more than pizza would. I must be the most parched crime-fighting turtle this side of the Mason-Dixon, if I do say so myself!” Mark was barely able to hide his disappointment when all the other turtles expressed similarly conflicted feelings about the four extra large pizzas he was holding, especially when he realized there wasn’t a single surfer-dude accent among them. To make matters worse, the rat who’d followed them out of the sewer didn’t speak any English at all, appearing to be a regular city rat with abnormally large proportions, and not at all a wise father figure who mentored the turtles in Ninjutsu.  “Now, now, now, your hospitality is unmatched, Mr. Mark, but we’d be remiss not to inform you that a pizza is as useful to us as tits on a bull, for on the subject of that confection, we are decidedly in a quandary as to whether it would delight us to eat it!” said Donatello, just before rapping his bo staff against a garbage can that Splinter was ravenously eating out of. “Oh, my dear rat gentleman, do recover your manners: introduce yourself instead of hen-pecking on refuse! Mr. Mark, you’ll have to excuse our friend’s Yankee manners. All our sewer-dwelling has us positively green around the gills, as we’ve been ridden hard and put wet practicing our martial artistries underground, is all, I assure you.” At this moment, Mark began to chalk up his attempt to make real Ninja Turtles as a failure. However, his hopes were briefly raised when a mugging occurred down the street and a masked burglar sprinted directly past the Ninja Turtles with an old woman’s purse. However, these hopes were swiftly dashed once more when Mark suggested the turtles use their martial arts skills to stop the robber. “Bless your idealist heart, Mr. Mark, but I must proclaim that this old turtle is worn slap out from today’s nunchuck-ery, and in no disposition to participate in more crime-fighting hullabaloo—that is, unless the reward is a dance with the Governor’s daughter, that Georgia peach. Oh, but just one waltz with her at the debutante ball would make me the most contented ninja turtle in all of Dixie!” Michaelangelo said to Mark as the mugger disappeared down the street. An increasingly bummed-out Mark began to walk away, kicking himself for daring to think that his favorite fictional characters could ever become a reality. “Mr. Mark, before you fetch your buggy back home, could you kindly direct us to the nearest riverboat casino? Us ninja turtles and our rat companion are fixin’ to play Bourrè!” We can’t blame Mark if he loses some of his enthusiasm for TMNT after a letdown like this.  Ninja Turtle fans everywhere can understand how disappointing this must be for a fanatic like Mark. It’s every TMNT’s dream to hang out with crime-fighting ninja turtles in real life, so to finally get the chance, only to hear them speak like Old South dandies and display complete impartiality towards pizza has got to be a real kick in the gut for him. Poor guy! Here’s hoping the next time he tries to create ninja turtles, they’re a little more similar to the iconic characters we know and love!"

Well, fuck. Just a moment ago, the conversation you’ve been having about current events with some buddies at a bar took an unexpected turn when one of your friends recited something you heard on a podcast earlier this week almost verbatim. There’s no chance of parallel thinking here either, because it was way too nuanced and specific of a take for your friend to have thought of it on his own. Still, this wouldn’t be such a big deal if it didn’t mean he definitely caught your ass when you also stole an idea almost verbatim from the exact same podcast a little earlier in the conversation.  Same fucking episode, too. There’s no way he doesn’t know. You and this man have now entered into a delicate, confusing dance. Who has the upper hand here? Is there even a move to be made? Your friend definitely knows you were lying when you said you’d heard about the current conditions in Ukraine “from a friend in Kyiv,” but you also know that your friend was lying when he said he’d “been reading a lot of historical texts on the Russian Empire.” You’ve both revealed yourselves as frauds, and it’s unclear how to proceed from here. Are you both just going to go on with life, knowing what you’ve done? But how? What kind of sick, twisted person would quote the same damn podcast episode you just quoted? It’s deranged and reckless! It’s established a fraught detente based on mutually assured destruction. If you called him out, he would do the same to you. If you mentioned the episode he stole from by name, then maybe your friends would listen to it, and although they’d know your friend was stealing from it, they’d know you were, too. There is no way to reveal this man’s deception without showing yourself to be just as much of a fraud as he is. Honestly, just change the subject entirely, because a situation this confounding is best left alone. It can only end in disaster. Godspeed as you continue to navigate this fucked up situation!"

But what happens the day that Ronald passes away? The repercussions would be on a scale that’s difficult to fathom, which is exactly why McDonald’s has already taken great lengths to prepare for it: According to a leaked internal memo circulated throughout McDonald’s employee network, the company has a meticulously detailed action plan for Ronald’s death, with pre-arranged responses and protocols accounting for every step of the process. Here’s a look at the intensive plans McDonald’s has put in place for the days after Ronald McDonald dies.    Wow. As tragic as Ronald’s death will be, it looks like McDonald’s is more than prepared for this sad eventuality. The day that Ronald passes away will mark the end of an era, so it’s no wonder they plan to pull out all the stops to honor his legacy. Ronald absolutely deserves a send-off on a scale like this, and without a doubt, he won’t soon be forgotten when he does die."

So much yes! This is such awesome news for anyone who owns some random piece of vaguely mid-century particle board furniture! As announced on their website earlier today, the furniture company will be mailing prior customers a dented piece of wood, a hex key, or some loose nuts and bolts as a token of their gratitude for helping them become one of the most popular places to order furniture online despite the fact that all of their items arrive with some massive, glaring flaw. As the company notes, even though Wayfair furniture will look at best decent because the gash in the wood was fortunately on the backside of the item, or at worst downright terrible because it was missing so many parts you couldn’t even assemble it, every item still has like a 4.4 star rating, and for that, the company wants to extend their warmest thanks. “It means the world to us that you’ve chosen Wayfair as your number one choice for barstools that you have to stick a piece of cardboard underneath to keep from wobbling and chipped end tables that won’t look right in any room you stick them in, and that’s why we’ll be sending you some random items lying around our warehouse as a way to show how honored we are,” explained the company on their website. “And if those parts we send as a thank you gift just so happen to be the parts you needed to finish assembling a piece of furniture you ordered from us that you’d otherwise given up on because our customer service ignored your many calls and emails, know that it wasn’t our intention, but we hope it proves just how wonderful it is to be part of the Wayfair family anyway.” This is so cool! What a great way to show your customers how much you care! If there was ever a reason to order an item from Wayfair rather than ordering the exact same item from Amazon, Home Depot, Lowe’s, Overstock, or Walmart instead, it’s definitely this. Way to go, Wayfair!"
Off To A Rocky Start: King Charles’s First Speech To The UK Was Mostly About How Much Better Tuna Tasted When They Still Let Some Dolphin Meat Get Into The Cans By Accident,N/A,https://clickhole.com/off-to-a-rocky-start-king-charless-first-speech-to-the-uk-was-mostly-about-how-much-better-tuna-tasted-when-they-still-let-some-dolphin-meat-get-into-the-cans-by-accident/,"Following the death of Queen Elizabeth II yesterday, all eyes have now turned to her son, who has succeeded his mother and taken the throne as King Charles III. Unfortunately, the new king’s reign seems to be off to a rocky start. King Charles’s first speech to his subjects in the United Kingdom was mostly about how much better tuna tasted when they still let some dolphin meat get into the cans by accident. Yikes. This is not an auspicious beginning to the new king’s reign. Speaking from the steps of London’s Buckingham Palace before a crowd of thousands, with millions more watching on television, King Charles stepped up to the podium and immediately said, “Now that my mother is in Heaven with Isaac Newton and the man she hit with her car, I think we can all openly acknowledge that the golden age of canned tuna is behind us. This is because the old warlocks who control the tuna canneries no longer let any dolphin meat slip into their cans every now and then.” For the remainder of the three-hour speech, Charles spoke to his new subjects about how canned tuna started tasting “sandy” in 1993, and that this decline in quality could be directly traced to the introduction of “dolphin-safe” tuna-canning practices introduced around that time. Charles went on to say that he would trade “every memory I have of my mother” for “one good can of tuna with a bit of dolphin in it.” Those in attendance began to look visibly uncomfortable as their new king spent the next hour speaking at length about how much better tuna used to taste when there weren’t “wraiths, ghouls, and Soviets” overseeing the tuna canning process to ensure that no dolphin meat accidentally contaminated the fish. During the speech, the new king made a number of claims that fact-checkers have struggled to verify, such as that everyone in England used to have much silkier, longer hair because of the natural oils they were consuming in the dolphin meat contained in their tuna cans, and that “the Tower Of London has shrunk four inches” ever since dolphin-safe tuna canning became a widespread practice. Charles also made the claim, which many English citizens found dubious and troubling, that Queen Elizabeth had died due to the “a lack of dolphin meat in her diet,” and that had she been “allowed to eat a pound or two of dolphin flesh here and there,” she would likely have lived another half-century at minimum. At one point during the king’s address, a reporter from the BBC interrupted to point out that it was actually an urban legend that dolphin meat was ever present in cans of tuna at all, to which King Charles replied, “No, I could definitely taste the dolphin” before immediately launching into a diatribe about how he would dedicate his reign as king to “returning English tunafish to its former glory” by requiring all tuna cans to contain 50% dolphin meat by volume, a proclamation that raised audible gasps and some boos from the king’s subjects who were in attendance."

Wow. Looks like Dr. Oz just bungled his campaign once again. Yesterday, Dr. Mehmet Oz, the Republican candidate for Senate in Pennsylvania, reportedly spent the afternoon campaigning in Philadelphia, after which he posted the following tweet:  Almost immediately, Dr. Oz received hundreds of replies from Twitter users pointing out that he is obviously not posing with the mascot of the Philadelphia Phillies, but rather an enormous man-bird hybrid covered in green fur who appears to have no affiliation with Major League Baseball in any way. Twitter users quickly piled on Dr. Oz with replies like, “Say you’re not from PA without saying you’re not from PA,” “Just bc someone has a beak and is covered in fur doesn’t mean they’re an MLB mascot,” “That’s literally just my cousin Brian lmao,”  and “You’re at a Citizens Bank.. not Citizens Bank Park.” The day quickly got even worse for the Dr. Oz campaign when his Democratic opponent, John Fetterman, quickly responded with a meme making fun of the candidate’s obvious confusion:   Woof. This is definitely not winning Dr. Oz any Philadelphia supporters. It’s hard to convince voters that you care about the state of Pennsylvania when you go around assuming every green humanoid bird monster you see is the Phillie Phanatic. Dr. Oz clearly tried to rectify the situation by replying to Fetterman that this was indeed the Phillie Phanatic, and he would know, because they spent the afternoon listening to reggaeton and throwing around a football together. However, this tweet only led to Dr. Oz getting dunked on by even more Twitter users who jumped at the chance to tell him he doesn’t even know what sport the Phillie Phanatic is a mascot for. Yikes. It’s safe to say that political blunders like this are not doing any favors for Dr. Oz’s campaign. If he wants to prove to Pennsylvanians that he’ll actually be able to represent them in Congress, he’ll need to start proving he knows a thing or two about Pennsylvania ASAP, and that he can tell the difference between a random green bird man he passes on the street and the real Phillie Phanatic. If he doesn’t get his act together soon, “Senator Mehmet Oz” isn’t looking too likely. "
Heartbreaking: This Man Just Discovered That The Dog-Face Instagram Filter Works On His Penis But He Doesn’t Have Anyone In His Life Who He Can Show It To,N/A,https://clickhole.com/heartbreaking-this-man-just-discovered-that-the-dog-face-instagram-filter-works-on-his-penis-but-he-doesnt-have-anyone-in-his-life-who-he-can-show-it-to/,"If you were hoping to read some uplifting news today, please, look elsewhere, because what one resident of Houston, Texas is going through right now is as depressing as it gets: This man just discovered that the dog-face Instagram filter works on his penis, but he doesn’t have anyone in his life who he can show it to. Just absolutely devastating. Our heart goes out to this poor, lonely guy. Earlier today, Leonard Fuller, 34, had been nude and fooling around with Instagram filters, when he made an utterly joyful discovery: the filter that puts a dog’s ears, nose, and tongue on your face somehow worked on his penis. Tragically, Leonard’s delight was cut short as he realized that there was no person he felt close enough with to send his dog-faced cock to. As the digital dog tongue playfully unspooled from the head of his penis, Leonard went through a mental rolodex of everyone in his life and could not think of a single person who it’d be appropriate to show this gleeful finding. No significant other. No friend with a raunchy sense of humor. No pets. Not one acquaintance he could send this hilarious photo of his penis to without it being considered sexual harassment and disturbingly out of character for him. At the moment, Leonard had never felt more alone in his life.  Leonard hesitated to delete the looping video he’d recorded, watching the perky dog face move wherever his penis moved as he desperately pondered a scenario in which it would make sense to share this with another person. He considered booking a physical with this doctor, who’d be seeing his penis during the appointment anyway, and seemed to be a generally upbeat person who might get a kick out of seeing a patient’s penis run through an augmented reality filter. He also wondered if the IT guy at his office would be interested in seeing it, purely from a tech perspective, given that someone who works with computers could certainly appreciate the technical intricacies involved in Instagram mistaking a flaccid penis for a human face.  But after running through for each scenario in his head, Leonard sadly recognized that sharing his digital dog penis with any person who didn’t regularly see his penis anyway would be a weird thing to do, and that, tragically, there was nobody in his life who saw his penis regularly. Were any of Leonard’s family, friends, or coworkers to see this photo, their first thought would be “Jesus Christ…that’s Leonard’s dick…,” instead of, “Wonderful! How delightful it is to see that Instagram filter work on Leonard’s penis, my life is a little better thanks to this small joy that Leonard was kind enough to share with me. What a great guy.” Leonard ultimately deleted the video, wistfully accepting that the sight of his penis with a dog face would be something he’d have to enjoy in solitude, as a memory known only to him. Ugh. We want to give this man a hug right now. It can’t be easy being in your mid-30s, single, and not close enough with anyone who’d appreciate a nude photo of your penis with an animal’s face digitally affixed to it. Hopefully Leonard eventually meets someone he can share a humorous photo of his penis with, and recapture the magic that filled him with such glee today. What else is life for? Hang in there, buddy!"
Most Feminist Movie Ever? Olivia Wilde Just Boasted That 14 Crew Members On The Set Of ‘Don’t Worry Darling’ Drowned In Female Ejaculate,N/A,https://clickhole.com/most-feminist-movie-ever-olivia-wilde-just-boasted-that-14-crew-members-on-the-set-of-dont-worry-darling-drowned-in-female-ejaculate/,"Since making her directorial debut with 2019’s critically acclaimed, female-centric film Booksmart, Olivia Wilde has quickly established herself as one of Hollywood’s leading feminist voices. Now, with a new film set for release this month, this incredible filmmaker is proving her commitment to empowering women is stronger than ever: Olivia Wilde just boasted that 14 crew members on the set of Don’t Worry Darling drowned in female ejaculate. Um, yes, yes, yes. Forget the Bechdel Test, THIS is how you create feminist cinema! Yesterday afternoon, at a Venice Film Festival press junket for Don’t Worry Darling, Wilde proudly revealed that 14 people on the set of her latest film died by suffocating in massive volumes of women’s ejaculation fluids. Wilde explained that no other filmmakers at Venice could say a single crew member—let alone over a dozen, ranging from craft service workers to gaffers to PAs to extras—drowned in copious amounts of girl cum during the production of their movies, and raised a triumphant fist in the air as she confirmed that everyone who drowned was male, declaring every crew member’s corpse that was found floating facedown in vaginal discharge as “groundbreaking moments for women in cinema.” “If you told me when I was a little girl that I’d one day direct a movie that’d cause 14 people to drown in female ejaculate, that little girl would’ve been so, so proud,” Wilde bragged, before touting that she was being sued for hundreds of millions of dollars by the families of those who died. “My attorney informed me that I was being held responsible for the wrongful deaths of over a dozen crew members due to the irresponsibly large amounts of women’s cum on set, and all I could think was, ‘hmm, yup, my movie is pissing off the right people.’ The chauvinistic legal response to these drownings has made it clear that we’ve made something really special, and men can’t handle it. There was not a single ounce of boy cum found in the lungs of anyone who drowned while making my movie. It was all girl cum. If you support female voices, go see Don’t Worry Darling in theaters on opening weekend!” The Queen Girlboss has spoken, people!!! Seriously, this may just be the most woman-positive movie ever made. We simply have to applaud Olivia Wilde for drowning all the right people in all the right fluids and owning it like that absolute badass female artist that she is. Every other filmmaker in Hollywood had better take note, because THIS is how you do feminism! Ugh, Don’t Worry Darling can’t come out soon enough!"
"Whoa, Slow Down There, Partner: This Cloud Is Really Hauling Ass For Some Reason",N/A,https://clickhole.com/whoa-slow-down-there-partner-this-cloud-is-really-hauling-ass-for-some-reason/,"Some folks simply don’t know how to take a load off and relax, and one hasty little fella we just met could really stand to learn how to live life in a lower gear: This cloud is really hauling ass for some reason. Chill out, buddy—no cloud needs to be moving that fast! It’s a beautiful day outside and we’re enjoying an idle afternoon of sitting around watching the world go by, but the same can’t be said for the big fluffy cloud that’s fucking booking it across the sky like it’s got a pack of wild dogs hot on its heels. Nice days like today are made for dawdling, and for this cloud to zip along so quick you could almost give yourself whiplash trying to follow it with your eyes, well, there’s really just no good reason for it. We believe that everyone should be free to go about their business at their own pace, of course, but when a cloud’s hotfooting it at such a wild clip that we get secondhand exhaustion merely from watching, someone really needs to take the cloud aside and say, “Slow your roll, amigo. You’ll hurry yourself into an early grave!” Why this poor floating bastard feels compelled to hurtle through the atmosphere at such breakneck speeds is anyone’s guess. It’s not like it’s blocking the sun. It’s not in anyone’s way at all! We could maybe understand the urgency if it was in a rush to deliver replenishing rainfall to one of the many drought-stricken regions around the country, but this definitely isn’t a rain cloud. It’s just a normal cloud zipping across the sky like a lunatic. Maybe it’s scared of something? That’s all we can think of. But again, clouds don’t really have predators, or enemies of any kind, so we’ve still got no clue what lit a fire under this cloud’s ass to make it move like there’s some sort of emergency somewhere. Far be it from us to understand why a cloud would choose to fucking leg it instead of calmly floating around like clouds normally do. It’s just weird, is all. It’s honestly kind of a shame this cloud can’t bring itself to slow down and smell the roses a bit. It must have a great view of the trees and the river and the town from up there, not to mention how clean the air must be, but even the most splendid wonders of nature aren’t enough to put our Type A little buddy here off its mad dash to wherever. We guess there’s no convincing it otherwise at this point, so we’ll just have to appreciate the lovely day on its behalf. Sorry it had to be like this, pal. Well, looks like the little guy’s almost out of sight. Here’s hoping it gets wherever it needs to be soon so it can finally ease up and dial things back a notch!"
New Guidance: The CDC Is Recommending Those Who Test Positive For COVID-19 Just Post A Picture Of Their Positive Test On Social Media And Follow Whatever Advice They Get In The Comments,N/A,https://clickhole.com/new-guidance-the-cdc-is-recommending-those-who-test-positive-for-covid-19-just-post-a-picture-of-their-positive-test-on-social-media-and-follow-whatever-advice-they-get-in-the-comments/,"Everyone get ready to make some major changes to your COVID-19 precautions, because a major new update in health and safety guidelines just dropped: The CDC is now recommending those who test positive for COVID-19 just post a picture of their positive test on social media and do whatever people suggest they do in the comments.  Better take note! Looks like there’s a new standard procedure for how to handle a positive COVID test. The CDC posted the updated COVID protocols on their website this morning, removing all references to isolation periods, masking, and treatments following an infection, and replaced them all with a new section which states, “Those who test positive for COVID-19 should immediately post a photo of their positive test to their Instagram story, Twitter, or Facebook feed and follow whatever advice people give them in the comments. It doesn’t matter how well you know the person or if they’ve ever actually had COVID-19, you should follow their advice as if it’s coming directly from a government health agency or your doctor.” The CDC’s guidance continues, “Even if the comment is from the least healthy person you know or someone who just thinks they had COVID because they ‘were really stuffed up for like 2 months,’ you should follow their advice to a T, no matter how many typos there are or how many times they contradict themselves within their own post. Whatever they say you should do, that’s what we say you should do.”  Alright! This is good to know. It’s awesome that the CDC is keeping us so up-to-date about the most modern methods for how to deal with the coronavirus! According to the CDC’s website, after posting that you have COVID on the social media platform(s) of your choice, possible examples of comments you should follow include:  “Orange juice, lots of rest, and binging Better Call Saul got me through it!” “Kept working and going to the gym and symptoms cleared up in 4 days, honestly I’ve felt worse from allergies” “echinacea tea!!!!!!!!!!1” “I was really sick for 15 days but my hubsand never got it even though we slept in the same bed” “Zinc. It works!”  and  “Ugh. So sorry to hear this! Kiddos brought it home from summer school last month. Peter was fine, just had your basic cold/flu symptoms, a little cough and congestion, but Alyssa got really sick. She never got her booster because we couldn’t find a pharmacy who was doing kids under 12 (in California no less! WTH!) She developed pneumonia and we had to take her to urgent care. I masked up the whole time, opened all the windows, sanitized every day, and I still got it! I felt OK but I think it was because I was in total mom mode taking care of the kids. Still have a little cough but I don’t know if that’s from the COVID or I’m just overthinking it. Matt never got it but we think he had Omicron before it was known as Omicron when he was down in Phoenix in November. My doc (great guy) who had BA.5 himself said that the best thing you can do is continue to rest for a week or so after even if you feel fine. He said there’s been some studies that show rest reduces the chance of a rebound infection and long covid (scary stuff, but good you’re vaxxed–it helps!). Message me if you need anything, you WILL get through this, but I know the timing isn’t great with the kids going back to school. Tylenol is your friend!” This is definitely something to keep in mind as we navigate the pandemic going forward! Whether the CDC’s new protocols stems from realizing no one really listens to them anymore anyway, wanting to put the onus on your friends and family instead of themselves to figure out what the hell to do about COVID at this point, or because they’re just fresh out of ideas is unclear, but whatever their reasoning, these new guidelines are an absolute game-changer. It’s going to be much more convenient to just check the comments under the picture of your positive COVID test than it was to have to stay updated on the CDC’s ever-changing quarantine and treatment guidelines. Kudos to the CDC for doing everything they can to keep the public in the loop about best practices for dealing with the pandemic going forward."
"Not Quite What It Was: A Newly Single Leonardo DiCaprio Is Trying To Build Momentum For The Pussy Posse, But Its Only Remaining Members Are Richard Kind And Jesse Tyler Ferguson",N/A,https://clickhole.com/not-quite-what-it-was-a-newly-single-leonardo-dicaprio-is-trying-to-build-momentum-for-the-pussy-posse-but-its-only-remaining-members-are-richard-kind-and-jesse-tyler-ferguson/,"You couldn’t read a tabloid in the late ‘90s without hearing about Leonardo DiCaprio and his “Pussy Posse,” a group of young Hollywood stars with a reputation for partying hard, pulling pranks, and chasing girls. Although a newly single Leo has been reportedly trying to reassemble the legendary squad of womanizers, the task is proving to be easier said than done, because the Pussy Posse’s only remaining members are Richard Kind and Jesse Tyler Ferguson. Woof. A night out with those two is definitely going to leave something to be desired. Following his recent split with his girlfriend of four years, the Titanic star has reportedly been hitting the party circuit as he re-embraces single life. Unfortunately, Leo’s return to bachelorhood isn’t quite up to par with what it once was, because the only two members of the Pussy Posse he’s been able to get to go out partying with him are character actor Richard Kind and Modern Family’s Jesse Tyler Ferguson. Paparazzi photos confirm that the trio hit a major Hollywood club last night, but those in attendance say that it didn’t look like they had much fun, as Richard Kind apparently repelled any woman who approached the group by asking her about her personal experience with the effects of the collective trauma suffered as a result of the pandemic, and Jesse Tyler Ferguson spent the whole time seated at a table scrolling through pictures of him and his husband on Google Images. Yikes. It’s great you love your husband, Jesse, but that’s not going to help Leo get back out there after his breakup. Later in the night, sources say that Leo and Richard Kind hit the dance floor, which seemed like it was going alright until Richard Kind kept cutting in on any girl who started to dance with Leo so that he and Leo could do something he made up called “The Brothers Dance,” because they’re “Brothers in Acting,” which was pretty much just a move-for-move rip-off of the Macarena. But as Richard Kind kept dancing, insiders say a frustrated Leo took a seat and sent a group text to several other members of the so-called “Pussy Posse”: Tobey Maguire, David Blaine, and Reba McEntire. As screenshots confirm, Leo texted the group, “Pussy Posse reunion??? Please come out. Partying is not the same w/o you.” Tobey Maguire declined, writing, “Sry dude, I’ve got the delta variant.” David Blaine declined, writing, “I need to stay home and practice my magic tricks.” Lastly, Reba McEntire declined, writing, “Nah man, I put that life behind me,” before adding, “SIKE! Just get on Raya, brother! So much easier to meet DTF chicks on an app than spend hours at the club!!” Oof. This is just depressing to watch. Although Leo reportedly made one last-ditch effort to save the evening by purchasing a round of shots for Richard Kind and Jesse Tyler Ferguson, after just one sip of tequila, Richard Kind started sobbing over what he’d only explain as “nostalgia,” and Jesse Tyler Ferguson started writing an online review of the liquor where he described it as “nothing special.” At that point, Leo reportedly decided to call it a night and order an Uber home. Damn. It looks like Leo is really struggling to relive his former club-kid glory days. While this definitely wasn’t the worst night out ever, it’s safe to say that Leo’s current version of the “Pussy Posse” is a far cry from what it used to be in its prime. Here’s hoping he finds some other pals to hit the town with soon, because these guys just don’t have an especially electric dynamic."
Major ‘Star Wars’ Revelation: George Lucas Has Revealed That The Character Of Darth Vader Was Based On Yoda,N/A,https://clickhole.com/major-star-wars-revelation-george-lucas-has-revealed-that-the-character-of-darth-vader-was-based-on-yoda/,"If you’re a Star Wars fan, then you’re in for the greatest thrill of your long, healthy life, because the creator of the series himself just dropped some incredible trivia about how he came up with one of the greatest villains in movie history. George Lucas has revealed that the character of Darth Vader was based on Yoda. Amazing! It’s so cool to get this kind of behind-the-scenes insight into how Star Wars was made. “The idea for Darth Vader basically came from looking at Yoda and the way Yoda behaves,” Lucas divulged in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter published earlier this week. “We were filming The Empire Strikes Back for 15 hours a day, and Yoda was constantly near me, and I thought to myself, ‘Yoda is such an interesting guy. I’d love to get him into Star Wars somehow. So I came up with this character that’s basically Yoda, and I called him Darth Vader, and the rest is history.’” This is so cool! We always knew Darth Vader seemed familiar, and now we know why: He’s based on Yoda! “Obviously, the character of Darth Vader is much taller and fatter than the real Yoda,” Lucas continues in the interview, “but everything else about Darth Vader and Yoda is basically the same. They both use the force. They both feel most at home in the swamp. They both cut off their son’s hand. They both like to kill people and complain. They both bite people who get all up in their space. And, just like Yoda, Darth Vader used to be Anakin Skywalker before he was seduced by the power of the Dark Side. Darth Vader was just my way of bringing Yoda to the silver screen.” Later in this amazing interview, Lucas drops the awe-inspiring trivia tidbit that Chewbacca was a composite character based on a combination of Han Solo and Harrison Ford. The Star Wars creator also tells the interviewer the fascinating story of how he first met Han Solo when Han Solo was auditioning for the role of C-3PO in Return Of The Jedi (sadly, Han Solo didn’t get the part, and the role of C-3PO eventually went to C-3PO. Han Solo was later cast in the role of Yoda). If you aren’t standing up and cheering right now, then you don’t deserve to call yourself a Star Wars fan! We are absolutely giddy with excitement over this awesome new look at the history of our favorite film franchise. It’s so cool to know that, through the character of Darth Vader, George Lucas was able to tell the story of Yoda and his incredible life. It’s an amazing testament to what a charismatic and interesting person Yoda is that he could inspire such a legendary movie icon. We can’t wait to rewatch all the movies with this brand new perspective!"
Must Be Rich: This Little League Player Has Gatorade Instead Of Water,N/A,https://clickhole.com/must-be-rich-this-little-league-player-has-gatorade-instead-of-water/,"Well, well, well! It looks like the Mud Hens of Fanwood, Iowa’s youth baseball league have themselves a bonafide Mr. Moneybags on their roster: This little league player has Gatorade instead of water.  Check out Richie Rich, with his 28 oz. Riptide Rush Gatorade. That thing probably cost his parents, what, $4, maybe even $5 after tax these days? Must be nice! Though every other pee wee player on his team either has their own refillable water bottle or is drinking out of the cooler jug their coach brought, shortstop Bennett Dougherty, 8, apparently comes from a family of means, judging by that big Gatorade he’s got with him in the dugout. Next to his teammates’ water, that neon blue Gatorade might as well be a gold placard reading “Class Signifier.” It’s also the larger kind of Gatorade bottle too, a whole size-up from the normal 16 oz. ones, like, the kid’s literally using both hands to get it to his mouth. Hey, no judgment here—if the Doughertys have the type of money that lets their kid experience the finer things in life, like going up to bat with a belly full of Gatorade instead of tap water and ice from the team cooler jug, good for them! Who wouldn’t want that luxury for their kid? This isn’t some Kirkland, wholesale Gatorade-rip-off sports drink either. This kid’s got name-brand Gatorade. No expenses spared for Bennett, huh? The Gatorade’s not the only indicator that Bennett was raised to have expensive taste: he’s also got ranch-flavored sunflower seeds, which, sure, are the same price as the regular kind that the other players have, but in tandem with the Gatorade, it’s just further proof that Bennett’s palette won’t be satisfied by the humble, plain old salted sunflower seeds that his other teammates are making do with.  Kid’s parents are probably going to buy him a hot pretzel from the concession stand after the game, too. Just watch. What a sight the Mud Hens’ dugout is right now, with Prince Bennett savoring a delicious Cool Blue Gatorade among water-sipping paupers. Hey, in the end, if Gatorade helps Bennett “One Percenter” Dougherty make some plays today, then it’s a win for the whole team. Let’s see if all those premium-brand electrolytes and sugar pays off on the field, because his folks certainly shelled out for ‘em! "
Clearly A Rush Job: Today’s Google Doodle Is A Super Rough Drawing Of Pirates And When You Hover Over It The Text Just Says ‘Celebrating When We Defeated Pirates’,N/A,https://clickhole.com/clearly-a-rush-job-todays-google-doodle-is-a-super-rough-drawing-of-pirates-and-when-you-hover-over-it-the-text-just-says-celebrating-when-we-defeated-pirates/,"The Google Doodle is usually a fun and informative little feature that adds a welcome bit of extra color to our use of the search engine, but unfortunately the site’s latest entry seems to have fallen short of their typical high standards: Today’s Google Doodle is a super rough drawing of pirates and when you hover over it the text just says ‘Celebrating when we defeated pirates.’ Yikes. Listen Google, we know they can’t all be winners, but we still expected better than this. Whether it’s a charming portrait of an under-appreciated historical figure or a full-blown interactive browser game, Google Doodles almost always display a professional level of polish, but today’s extremely slapdash sketch of a few barely recognizable pirate guys suggests that the team was forced to cut more than a few corners to meet their deadline. The entire premise of the Doodle seems pretty half-assed as well, because there’s nothing we can find online that suggests today has any particular historical relevance to pirates, let alone some decisive event in which they were “defeated.” We’d hoped clicking on the Doodle might pull up some websites that would clarify what specifically they meant by that vague mouseover text, but doing so just takes you to the search results for the word ‘history,’ a detail that removes any lingering doubt we had that this pirate drawing is a result of Google scrambling to get something, anything out the door. It’s fair to say this is definitely not one of the better showings from the Google Doodle team. Here’s hoping they can take a little more time with their next one and get back to their usual quality!"
"Okay, Debbie Downer: All Of This Woman’s Songs Are Sad Even Though She Is Dating The Hot Guy From ‘Normal People’",N/A,https://clickhole.com/okay-debbie-downer-all-of-this-womans-songs-are-sad-even-though-she-is-dating-the-hot-guy-from-normal-people/,"No matter how good some people have it in life, they insist on seeing the glass half-empty instead of half-full. Case in point: All of this woman’s songs are sad even though she is dating the hot guy from Normal People. Alright, Debbie Downer. If that’s how you want to be, so be it. For whatever reason, it seems that going home to the really hot Irish guy from Normal People every night is just not enough for this woman, whose attitude is so negative she can’t manage to write even one song where she seems remotely happy. Despite the fact that she gets to ask her boyfriend about what it was like bringing one of Sally Rooney’s amazing novels to life any time she wants and gets to hear awesome stories from her boyfriend about all the ins and outs of working for Hulu, Little Miss Glum over here insists on sporting a 24/7 sourpuss and bringing anyone who listens to her music down with her. Her boyfriend probably even got to meet Sally Rooney! He probably got a free Hulu sweatshirt that she can borrow whenever she wants! What the heck is she always complaining for?  While you’d think that dating someone who’s so hot that he’s known as “the hot guy from Normal People” would inspire songs titled “My Boyfriend (He’s Very Hot)” or “Having A Sexy Boyfriend From The Sally Rooney Show Is Awesome,” instead, this woman’s songs are mainly about crying, failing to live in the moment, wanting to kill someone in Kyoto, reflections on lost love, someone getting killed at a baseball stadium, or once again failing to live in the moment. Hopefully her boyfriend doesn’t catch wind of these oppressively bleak songs, because if he hears them, he might end up thinking she’s sad because of him! SMDH. She even got so sad that she smashed her guitar while performing on Saturday Night Live! Watch it, Negative Nancy, you probably bummed out Kenan! Plus, this woman is such a downer that she insists on performing in this scary, upsetting costume: Even though someone with such a fine piece of arm candy who probably smells like Hulu headquarters should be performing in an awesome, happy costume like this:  C’mon lady! Why don’t you take a hint from Snoopy and turn that frown upside down!  As if this whole mess wasn’t confusing enough, this woman even teamed up to make sadder songs with a guy who has been making depressing songs for like 20 years, even though that guy’s music has been featured on Chuck, Bones, Gossip Girl, Crashing, and The O.C.! A really good episode of The O.C. too—well no, not the one where Marissa shoots Trey, but the Christmukkah episode, which is still really cool! If our music had been featured in that episode, we’d only ever write songs about smiling and feeling incredible for the rest of our lives. What the heck is wrong with these pessimists?! Everyone has their bad days, but let’s not forget to look for the silver linings, people! Look, lady. It’s time to knock that chip off your shoulder and start realizing how good you’ve got it! After all, no one likes a cynic. Here’s hoping this woman realizes how lucky she is to have a boyfriend who can tell her what it was like pretending to be a working class Irishman named Connell and starts cheering up soon!"
Reducing Restrictions: The CDC Has Announced It’s Okay To Die Of The Coronavirus Now,N/A,https://clickhole.com/reducing-restrictions-the-cdc-has-announced-its-okay-to-die-of-the-coronavirus-now/,"If you’re one of the final holdouts who has remained strict about COVID precautions even as most of the country has done away with masks and social distancing, prepare to breathe a sigh of relief: After almost 3 years of COVID-19 upending our lives, the CDC has announced it is now okay to die of the coronavirus.  Finally, one less restriction to worry about! CDC director Rochelle Walensky gave a press conference this morning to announce the major change in CDC recommendations, explaining, “Early on in the pandemic, every death from the coronavirus was a tragedy. Thankfully, due to remarkable advancements in being desensitized to widespread sickness and death over the past several years, we have reached the point where dying of the coronavirus has become fine. Similar to dying of the flu or in a car crash—other causes of mostly preventable deaths that we could do more to curb, but don’t because it’s sort of hard and boring—dying of COVID-19 is now completely okay we recommend that Americans begin incorporating passing away from this disease into their daily routines.” According to CDC’s updated “How to Protect Yourself and Others” page, the CDC still recommends hand washing, getting vaccinated, and increasing ventilation as ways of mitigating COVID risk, but under the subheading “Dying of COVID-19” it now states “COVID-19 is a deadly disease, but dying from it is now fine. Currently, close to 500 people a day are still dying from it, but that’s OK, because it’s not quite as bad as 3,000+ a day, and as long as you don’t do the math of how many that adds up to in a week or a month it doesn’t seem terrible, really.”  This new guidance couldn’t have come at a better time for the thousands of patients currently hospitalized with COVID-19 who are hanging on for dear life, as now they now know that if they do end up succumbing to the disease, it’s perfectly okay. Additionally, the CDC has announced that anyone who has been taking life-altering precautions to avoid COVID-19, including the millions of Americans of an advanced age and those who have preexisting conditions that make them more vulnerable to the disease, now has the official go-ahead to not only contract COVID-19, but to succumb to it. Yep, it was definitely time for the CDC to take this important step towards returning to normal! This announcement couldn’t have come soon enough! Of course, some will say the CDC waited far too long to make dying of COVID okay, and others will argue they should have waited until daily deaths were down to like, 150 a day before giving the all-clear to dying of COVID, but after almost 3 years of trying not to die, this is going to be welcome news for the majority of Americans. While the CDC is unlikely to announce that it’s okay to die of monkeypox or polio anytime soon, hopefully we can eventually get there as a nation as well. If you’ve been avoiding dying of COVID, trust in the CDC’s updated guidance and give yourself a break from all that stress and anxiety, get out there, and die from it. "
Pathetic: This Wedding Table Of Late 30-Something Singles Thinks They’re The Fun Table,N/A,https://clickhole.com/pathetic-this-wedding-table-of-late-30-something-singles-thinks-theyre-the-fun-table/,"Get ready to feel some second-hand cringe, because the scene going down at a wedding in Montclair, NJ is truly pathetic: This wedding table of late 30-something singles thinks they’re the fun table. Yikes. This is hard to watch. Tragically, this group of eight 30-something singles has officially declared that the reason they were assigned to the same table is because they’re the “fun people,” even though their common denominator is quite obviously that they’re just stragglers who haven’t hit any of the milestones that most people their age have. Although their table is literally in the back of the ballroom and couldn’t be further from the bride and groom, these delusional near-40-year-olds, have convinced themselves that it’s not their lack of plus-ones that led to them being placed randomly with a bunch of people they’ve never met at a table next to the caterer’s station, but rather that they were the “troublemakers” who were definitely going to “get way too rowdy to be near the front!” How truly disturbed. These people are fully delusional. It’s bad enough that these middle-aged failures think they’re the life of the party, but it’s even worse that their definition of a wild time seems to be drinking a tequila soda past 9 P.M. and eating two slices of cake. Despite the fact that nobody paid this group any attention when they “hilariously” did the Macarena dance to “Blurred Lines,” they spent the rest of the night laughing about how “insane” and “lit” they were acting, as well as making completely unsupported claims that the bride’s parents were going to “kick them out” if they did something like that again. Good Lord. Before the end of the night, this group made sure to pile into the photo booth to memorialize the “fun table,” and, horribly, they decided it was “so crazy” and “classic them” that they were all wearing random pirate hats and sunglasses in the photo, even though literally everyone also wore that stuff in their photo booth pictures, because they were literally supplied by the company that makes the photo booth for the purpose of being worn in the photos. This is just so, so sad. If you’re in the process of planning a wedding, consider leaving any 30-something singles off the guest list entirely so as not to risk something this pathetic happening at your own ceremony. It’s one of the most humiliating and painful things to watch. Here’s hoping a similar group of oblivious losers never gets invited to a wedding again!"
"Every Parent’s Worst Nightmare: This Child Is Dumb, Mean, And Smells Bad",N/A,https://clickhole.com/every-parents-worst-nightmare-this-child-is-dumb-mean-and-smells-bad/,"When two people have a child, they are filled with hopes and dreams for its future, looking forward to the happy years they’ll spend guiding their little one’s development. But unfortunately, there are times when those hopes are suddenly dashed, like in the case of this poor couple that has endured a shocking tragedy: Sadly, it turns out that their child is dumb, mean, and smells bad. This is truly every parent’s worst nightmare. Ben and Michelle Dawson were overjoyed when they first brought their son Mason home from the hospital as an infant, and his toddlerhood went by uneventfully, but unfortunately, the family’s happiness wouldn’t last forever: Around their son’s fifth birthday, Mason’s parents’ lives changed forever as they began to notice that their child was a stinky moron with a terrible personality. “I had imagined Mason could be a teacher, an astronaut, a father, anything he wanted. Nothing could have prepared me for the fact that he walks around all day with a scowl on his dumb face, poking people in the eyes and stinking like old garbage,” said Michelle. “He doesn’t say any words other than ‘Huh?’ and ‘Shut up.” I bathe him every night, but nothing gets rid of the manure smell. They say parenthood is always hard, but I wouldn’t wish this pain on anyone.” Wow. If your child isn’t dumb, mean, or smelly, it’s probably time you count your blessings. The pain has only increased for the Dawson family as they have watched Mason’s peers grow into curious, kind, successful, sweet-scented elementary schoolers, while he remains a nasty, foul-odored halfwit. “There is truly nothing more painful for a parent than to see your idiotic son slam headfirst into the door of his kindergarten classroom, proceed to flip off his his teacher and then bite her on the ankle, and then quickly get kicked out of class due to how badly his natural smell is distracting the other students,” said Ben. “In moments like that, you truly wish you could switch places with your son so you could be the one to endure life as a rude moron who reeks. But instead, you have to watch helplessly while he tears around in circles like a dumbass, growling viciously and repelling everyone around him with his awful odor.” “I’ve smelled the other kids in Mason’s class—they smell incredible,” Michelle added. ‘”My son smells like the dump. Do you know how hard it is to live with that, day in and day out?” This is so difficult. Ben and Michelle are going through something we all hope we never have to endure if we have kids. Being a parent is one of the hardest jobs there is, and we have to hand it to this couple for carrying on every day in the face of a horrible predicament. Good luck, Ben and Michelle. Let’s hope you are someday able to find a way to make your son less stupid, evil, and smelly."

However, not everyone is impressed with his meteoric rise to success: Ringling Bros. is currently tweeting that Dwayne Johnson might be having a moment now, but 80 years ago, he’d be BEGGING to lift spherical dumbbells in their circus.  Shots fired, folks! Whether it’s true or just bitter jealousy, the Ringling Bros. are absolutely going off on Dwayne right now! Earlier today, the Ringling Bros. official Twitter account suddenly began taking Dwayne Johnson to down a peg, alleging that if Dwayne was trying to start a career back between the 1920s and 1940s, he’d be knocking on Ringling’s doors, pleading for a chance to join their sideshow exhibition and heave heavy circular barbells, pull old tractors with a rope tied to his waist, and lift 6 pinup models at once with his outstretched arms.  Check out Ringling’s tirade against The Rock below. Wow! This circus has zero qualms throwing shade against one of the most famous celebrities in the world!  Only time will tell if Dwayne claps back at Ringling Bros. or not, but what’s certain is that the circus has just made their opinion on The Rock’s success crystal clear. What do you think? Would The Rock have gotten on his hands and knees to beg the circus for a job if he was living in the early 20th century? Let us know in the comments!"

Panicking only makes matters worse. Unfortunately, we’re currently witnessing a perfect example of how NOT to act in a life-threatening scenario: This carbon monoxide detector is emitting a shrill series of chirps instead of suggesting realistic, practical paths forward.   Shrieking like a banshee is absolutely not helping at all right now. Jesus. For 30 minutes now, this carbon monoxide detector has been histrionically bleeping about the carbon monoxide leaking throughout the house, offering absolutely zero constructive input about what steps we should take to address the problem. Understandably, a CO leak is not something to take lightly, but hysterically screeching about it for half an hour like this carbon monoxide detector’s doing is just a frustratingly counterproductive reaction. Right now it’s important to stay calm, carefully assess the situation, and remove ourselves from danger with rational thinking and teamwork. It is not a time to beep. All this carbon monoxide detector has done is lose its cool and add far more stress to an already stressful situation. Honestly, by freaking out and diverting everyone’s attention away from solving the problem, this carbon monoxide detector is making the situation about itself. Yes. There’s a carbon monoxide leak. We get it. We haven’t forgotten. Now get a hold of yourself and tell us what to do about it. Like, should we open a window or something? Why the hell are we coming up with all the solutions when it’s literally the carbon monoxide detector’s area of expertise?  For Christ’s sake. We’re all going to die because this helpless piece of shit is shrieking and having a meltdown instead of offering useful suggestions. If we survive this, the first thing we’re doing is throwing the carbon monoxide detector in the trash. All it does is flip its wig and make things more stressful. "
Interesting But Not Damning: The FBI Has Revealed That All They Found In Trump’s Mar-a-Lago Safe Were The Love Letters He’d Never Felt Courageous Enough To Send To Lois Griffin,N/A,https://clickhole.com/interesting-but-not-damning-the-fbi-has-revealed-that-all-they-found-in-trumps-mar-a-lago-safe-were-the-love-letters-hed-never-felt-courageous-enough-to-send-to-lois-griffin/,"If you’ve been following the news about the FBI’s raid on Mar-a-Lago, you’ll be relieved to know that the top secret documents former president Donald Trump stored on the premises weren’t the security threat we’d feared they were. As it turns out, the evidence federal authorities collected is undoubtedly interesting, but in no way damning: The FBI has revealed that all they found in Trump’s Mar-a-Lago safe were the love letters he’d never felt courageous enough to send to Lois Griffin. Wow. While we’re fascinated by Trump’s private infatuation with Family Guy’s matriarch, it’s a big relief it is to know nuclear documents haven’t fallen into the wrong hands! At a press conference early this morning, FBI Director Christopher Wray announced the 532 pages of Trump’s handwritten, Quahog-addressed letters professing his secret love and devotion to Lois Griffin that were discovered in a Mar-a-Lago safe were indeed sensitive information, but were completely legal and contained no information that could compromise national security. Wray then confirmed the end of all federal investigations into the former president’s handling of high-level national security documents, and issued a formal apology to Trump for invading matters of his own personal privacy, explaining that they never intended to bring any of the unsent acrostic poems or pleas for Lois Griffin to leave her “slob” of a husband to the public’s attention. “As the head of the FBI, I take full responsibility and sincerely apologize for any distress that the public disclosure of these love letters has caused for Donald Trump, Lois Griffin, and both the Trump and Griffin families,” explained Wray. “If any Saudi Arabian officials did manage to access Trump’s safe at Mar-a-Lago, all they would have found is a trove of romantic writing by a tender soul too afraid to express his true feelings to the woman who he believed was the love of his life, their unrealized affair clearly eating away at Mr. Trump’s heart over the 20-plus years he’d written these increasingly intense, lovelorn appeals to ‘[his] Quahog minx.’ These letters—postmarked, addressed, but never mailed—were never meant for the eyes of anyone other than Donald Trump and Lois Griffin. We ask the media and public to respect their privacy.” Excerpts from the letters show just how head-over-heels Donald Trump was for Lois Griffin, and how willing he was to throw away his marriage, and even his presidency itself, to be with her. Take a look at a small selection of the leaked love letters below! “Rhode Island is no place for a woman like you, Lois. Come to New York. Be with me. My wife Melania will look after your little one, Stewie. She’ll understand. Hell, I’ll come to you. I’ll buy a gorgeous, massive penthouse apartment in downtown Quahog, and we can go there together. I don’t care what happens. What matters is you and me and nothing else.” [Donald Trump to Lois Griffin, dated January 31, 1999] “L is for Lovely woman!
O is for Of course Trump loves Lois!
I is for Incredible woman!
S is for Sexy woman!” [Donald Trump to Lois Griffin, dated September 12, 2001] “If you come live with me in New York, don’t bring that dog. That’s my only condition for our love.” [Donald Trump to Lois Griffin, dated February 14, 2005] “I get nervous before taking the stage at my rallies. The only thing that helps is imagining that every supporter in the crowd is you, with your big triangle nose and nasally laugh and enormous breasts. It gives me all the bravery in the world.” [Donald Trump to Lois Griffin, dated October 31, 2015] “My son Barron would like to be with your Meg. We can go on double-dates together. Wouldn’t that be nice?” [Donald Trump to Lois Griffin, dated November 8, 2019] “I was totally unable to pay attention to the morning briefing today. I was daydreaming about burying my face in your beautiful red hair, until a Secret Service agent burst into the room, running his mouth about someone storming the Capitol. For a moment, I thought, ‘Could it be Lois? Has she finally given up her boring life in Quahog with that disgusting failure Peter, and realized that she is much, much better off with me?’ God, I don’t care about anything but you anymore. To hell with this job. I’d give these people the Capitol and more if it meant we could be together.” [Donald Trump to Lois Griffin, dated January 6, 2021] “Everytime I see you with that fat pig Peter, I want to die. My heart can’t take it. The sight of such an undeserving man putting his lips on you makes me want to hang myself with my own necktie. I enjoy your large son Chris, though. He’s very funny!” [Donald Trump to Lois Griffin, dated January 6, 2021] “When I think of the best version of myself, the Donald Trump I’d be the most proud to be? It’s the version of me that’s brave enough to send these letters to you, Lois. It’s the version of me that’s taking your last name and growing old with you. Will I ever be brave enough to be that man, Lois? You give me the strength that makes me believe I might be, one day. Wait for me, Lois!” [Donald Trump to Lois Griffin, dated January 6, 2021] Phew. Thank god our national security hasn’t been compromised! These letters are definitely fascinating, but they’re unlikely to threaten the United States in any way. No matter what you think of President Trump, you have to admit he did nothing wrong except refuse to follow his heart and profess his love to Lois Griffin directly. Every American should be glad to hear that there was nothing to worry about inside Trump’s Mar-a-Lago safe!"
Major Rebrand: Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. Restaurants Are Changing Their Theme To The Part In ‘Forrest Gump’ Where Sally Field Has Loud Sex With Forrest’s Principal,N/A,https://clickhole.com/major-rebrand-bubba-gump-shrimp-co-restaurants-are-changing-their-theme-to-the-part-in-forrest-gump-where-sally-field-has-loud-sex-with-forrests-principal/,"For fans of the 1994 movie Forrest Gump, there’s no more exciting place to eat than Bubba Gump Shrimp Company, the real-life version of the seafood restaurant Forrest founded in the film in honor of his late friend Bubba. However, it looks like the seafood chain is shaking things up a bit, because the restaurants have unveiled plans to change their theme to the part in Forrest Gump where Sally Field has loud sex with Forrest’s principal! So amazing! Forrest Gump fans are not going to want to miss out on this awesome rebrand! According to an announcement from the company’s management, Bubba Gump restaurants will continue to be a bucket list destination for Forrest Gump lovers, but their food and decor will now evoke the part of the movie where Forrest’s mom and principal have sex that’s so loud that a young Forrest can hear it even though he’s outside on a swing like 50 feet away. In the redesign, the restaurants will now have darkened lights and turf flooring to ensure that patrons feel like they, too, are sitting outside on an Alabama night while their mom gets railed by their school’s head administrator—which will feel especially realistic because the actual audio of Sally Field having sex with the principal will be broadcast over the speakers every ten minutes from a replica version of Forrest’s Victorian boyhood home in the corner of the restaurant. But Bubba Gump patrons won’t just get to look at Forrest’s house—they’ll also get to venture inside, because it doubles as a gift shop where they can find exciting new merchandise, such as a sweat-stained handkerchief exactly like the one the principal uses to cool himself off right after sleeping with Forrest’s mom, or a mug that says, “I SLEPT WITH THE PRINCIPAL TO ENSURE FORREST GUMP COULD GO TO SCHOOL EVEN THOUGH HIS IQ WAS TECHNICALLY 5 POINTS TOO LOW!” Plus, people who loved Bubba Gump’s original seafood menu can rest assured that their favorite dishes won’t disappear with the rebrand—they’ll just be under new names. “Mama Gump’s Garlic Bread Basket” will now be “Mama Gump’s Loud Fuckin’ Bread,” and ‘Jenny’s Surf And Turf” will be “The Principal Who Barked Like A Dog During Sex With Mrs. Gump’s Surf And Turf.” And if you’re a fan whose favorite moment of this scene is when the principal walks out of the house and says to Forrest, “You don’t say much, do you?” to which young Forrest replies with a biting impression of his ape-like sex noises—you’re in for a treat! Every night at 8 PM, diners will be invited to show off their own impression of the principal’s hooting sex sounds, and whoever makes the most accurate sex hoots will receive a t-shirt printed with a close-up of young Forrest’s troubled face as he listens to the disturbing, deafening sounds of his principal fucking his mom! Just amazing! If you thought you already had the full Forrest Gump experience at Bubba Gump’s, think again, because this redesign definitely seems worth checking out. This is the best news Forrest Gump fans are going to hear all day, and we can’t stop cheering!"
Embarrassing For Him: Historians Now Believe Christopher Columbus Probably Could’ve Found Spices At The Store,N/A,https://clickhole.com/embarrassing-for-him-historians-now-believe-christopher-columbus-probably-couldve-found-spices-at-the-store/,"We have long known that Christopher Columbus arrived in the Americas partly by accident, meaning instead to explore India and China in search of valuable spices, but recent research has revealed that the famed explorer may have made an additional, even more embarrassing blunder than simply landing on the wrong continent: Historians now believe that Columbus probably could’ve found spices at the store. Oof. Kind of makes him look like an idiot, doesn’t it? “After examining several hundreds of pages of archival documents, I am confident that if Christopher Columbus needed cloves, cumin, anise, or any other number of spices, his best bet would have been to check the store rather than immediately resorting to a months-long sea voyage involving three ships and a crew of more than 80 people,” says Yale historian Miles Ossorno. “Journals from regular Spaniards living in Columbus’s time prove in no uncertain terms that the store was one of the main places to get salts, peppercorns, and all manner of seasonings—they typically sell them in individual bottles near the flours and oils. Frankly, I think most of Columbus’s contemporaries assumed that that’s where he was going when he said he was ‘setting out in search of spices.’” Wow. It’s a good thing Christopher Columbus isn’t alive now, because he would be devastated learn that his entire journey was a complete waste of time. Ossorno added that the near-mutiny on Columbus’s 1492 voyage was most likely precipitated by Columbus’s ignorance regarding spice procurement. “Newfound log entries show crew members becoming increasingly frustrated with their captain, saying things like, ‘If he wanted spices so bad I could have picked some up for him no problem,’ and ‘It’s too bad we can’t just stop at the store and get all this over with,” Ossorno said. “Though it is impossible for me to confirm, it almost seems as if Christopher Columbus had never even been to the store, or at least had failed to look carefully through each of the major aisles there.” Well, this is a pretty humiliating look into the career of one of the most famous explorers of all time. Columbus certainly could have saved himself a lot of time and effort if only he had thought to look for spices at the store instead of sailing all the way across the Atlantic Ocean. Hindsight is 20/20, but we have to imagine that he is rolling in his grave right now. Sorry about that, Columbus!"
Fascinating Insight: Sears Has Revealed That Everyone Who Works At A Sears Was Born In The Sears And Lives In The Sears ,N/A,https://clickhole.com/fascinating-insight-sears-has-revealed-that-everyone-who-works-at-a-sears-was-born-in-the-sears-and-lives-in-the-sears/,"An iconic American brand just revealed a fascinating detail about their business model that is pretty surprising, but also makes a lot of sense: Sears has revealed that everyone who works at Sears was born in the Sears and lives in the Sears.  How cool! It’s alway fun when a business reveals these quirky little details about their operations.  Sears shared their fascinating policy on their website over the weekend when it added a new page titled “Life inside a Sears.” The page explains, “Ever wonder why every Sears feels like home? It’s because it is home to everyone who works here, from our cashiers to our managers to our cleaners…even the CEO! Everyone who works in a Sears was born in it and lives in it, so our employees have the loyalty and product knowledge that only comes with being fully immersed in a Sears from birth. Being born in a Sears and living inside a Sears has been a requirement to work at Sears since our founding in 1893, and this proud tradition continues to this day.” The company’s webpage also includes photos depicting an entire Sears staff tucked in for bed in the mattress section, a mother in a Sears uniform giving birth in the washing machine section, a funeral for a Sears worker taking place in the wheelbarrow section, and a peek at the garden in the back room where Sears employees grow all of their food and medicine. While it doesn’t specify if the Sears employees who are all born in the Sears and live in the Sears are allowed to leave the Sears they work in, the photos clearly illustrate that the staff seem truly happy to live inside a Sears, so either way it seems like a great life.  “Since every Sears is filled with quality home goods, it’s the perfect space for our employees to live out their days from birth until death,” the website continues. “We treat our customers like family because you’re literally in our home.” Pretty awesome! We knew Sears was a wonderful corporation, but knowing this behind-the-scenes factoid makes the brand all the more charming! It’s always felt a bit like Sears employees were possibly born and living inside the Sears they’re working at, and now we know why. Guess this could be a letdown for anyone who’s always wanted to work at Sears but wasn’t born in one, but hey, you can’t get every job you want. Sears really deserves their own documentary or something, because they’ve gotta be the only retailer in the nation where every one of their employees was born in the store and lives in it, and that’s just plain cool."
You Call This A Bounty? This Cornucopia Is 100 Percent Cucumbers,N/A,https://clickhole.com/you-call-this-a-bounty-this-cornucopia-is-100-percent-cucumbers/,"We’ve seen some real dogshit symbols of abundance in our day, but whatever asshole slapped this one together may have just set an all-time low: This cornucopia is 100 percent cucumbers. God, this shit sucks so fucking bad. Any idiot knows that when you want to represent a rich and bountiful harvest, your go-to symbol should be a big horn-shaped basket overflowing with a colorful assortment of fruits and vegetables, but unfortunately the dumbass who shat out this cornucopia didn’t get the memo because they bafflingly decided to fill it with nothing but cucumbers. Now don’t get us wrong, cucumbers definitely have their place in a proper cornucopia if you’ve also got squashes and tomatoes and grapes and the like, but it’s insane to think that they can carry the whole thing on their own. If someone lays this cornucopia out on your table, you’re not praising the gods for the fruitful yield of your fertile lands—you’re butchering the mule and still starving to death before there’s even snow on the ground. It’s genuinely wild that someone was able to look at all these cucumbers and think, “Yeah, that sure looks like a bounty alright.” Maybe this feels plentiful if the most produce you’ve ever seen at once is two or three cucumbers, but to anyone with normal expectations of harvest iconography this just feels dire and pathetic. An overflowing basket of potatoes, now that we could almost understand. They’re filling, and relatively nutritionally complete. But just cucumbers? Sorry, but not in a million years could we ever consider this charade a legitimate Horn of Plenty. Hell, we’ve seen greater bounties of produce next to the register at Starbucks. We honestly feel like we’ve been more cursed by the harvest gods than blessed by them after having seen this pitiful little display. Plenteousness and agricultural prosperity feel very far away when you’re looking at an array of wall-to-wall cucumbers like this. If this is sincerely the best celebration of the land and its gifts you can possibly throw together, please believe us when we tell you it’d be better just to not do anything at all. Boy, this thing has really ruined our day. Here’s wishing good luck to whatever moron put this mess together, because if all your harvest could shit out was a few dozen cucumbers that won’t even last you through the first month of winter, you’re sure as hell gonna need it!"
Who Gives A F*ck About An Oxford Comma? They Do. Meet The Four Columbia Prepsters Who Prove That Caring About Grammar Might Just Rock.,N/A,https://clickhole.com/who-gives-a-fck-about-an-oxford-comma-they-do-meet-the-four-columbia-prepsters-who-prove-that-caring-about-grammar-might-just-rock/,"Sweaty nightclubs. Too much booze. Leather jackets. Those are just a few of the things that come to mind when you think of “rock ‘n’ roll.” But for a new indie rock group heralding from upper Manhattan, the drugged-up motorcycle scene of rock music past couldn’t be less appealing.  Their name is “Vampire Weekend,” and they’re the young rockers who are saying, “Yeah, we do care about grammar. But maybe, just maybe, grammar might just rock.” Decked out in boat shoes, cable knit sweaters, and—if you can believe it—pants, the musicians behind Vampire Weekend look more like they’re about to discuss Nietzsche over Negronis than shred up the stage. It turns out, though, that this is all part of the band’s message that anyone—whether you wear pleated khakis or ripped jeans—can play guitar, bass guitar, other guitar, keyboard, and drums. If that’s a bit too heady for you to parse, that might have something to do with the band’s Ivy League pedigree. Turns out, the future rockers met each other during their freshman year at Columbia University by chance after they were the only four people to enroll in the course Math 101. To this day, the band’s Columbia ties remain strong, as each of the four members are still living in the dorms, working as resident advisors. Yep, you read that right: looks like they haven’t been able to quit their day jobs just yet! And while most rock ‘n’ rollers are writing songs about drugs, women, sex, and girls, Vampire Weekend is penning hits about Oxford commas (a British comma), Mansard roofs (a French type of roof), and A-Punks (the Italian word for punks).  That’s not to say these songs don’t carry a rock ‘n’ roll attitude. Take for instance the first lyric from their song, Oxford Comma: Who gives a f*ck about an Oxford comma? Kicking off a song with the F-bomb? Kurt Cobain is undoubtedly nodding his head in approval from Heaven! But do the studious young men of Vampire Weekend have a full-time career in music ahead of them? Well, that’s still up for debate, but if their singles have been any indication of what’s to come, we’d say that Vampire Weekend is well on their way to becoming the first band ever to make the Dean’s List and the Billboard Charts! Vampire Weekend can be seen opening for Ratatat this Friday at New York City’s Mercury Lounge."
"ClickHole Summer Music Series: If Any Guys From Bands Like The Stooges Or T. Rex Or Stuff Like That Are Still Alive, You’re Welcome To Perform A Stupid Little Concert In Our Office Any Time You Please",N/A,https://clickhole.com/clickhole-summer-music-series-if-any-guys-from-bands-like-the-stooges-or-t-rex-or-stuff-like-that-are-still-alive-youre-welcome-to-perform-a-stupid-little-concert-in-our-office-any-time-yo/,"Summer’s in full swing, and there’s nothing that says summer quite like live music. That’s why we’re proud to introduce ClickHole’s Summer Music Series, wherein we’re issuing a standing invitation to any guys from bands like The Stooges or T. Rex or stuff like that who are still alive to come perform a stupid little concert in our office any time they please! Yes, you read that right! If you’re Iggy Pop or Ace Frehley or Lou Reed and you’re not dead, we want you to play a set right in the middle of our office! Anybody who can say stuff like, “I was in the Buzzcocks” or, “I’m one of the Ramones” is officially welcome to come on down to our office anytime to play one of the shortest, dumbest sets of their life. We’ve already let our building manager know that he can open the door for any gray-haired man with a guitar saying he’s a guy from Genesis or the Allman Brothers or The Jesus Lizard or whatever, and once you’re in, head right on up to the fifth floor where we’ll start pushing desks around until there’s enough room for however many people make up the remaining members of your strange old band to play their stupid little songs in the dumbest possible way.  You definitely don’t have to play for a long time, either, just two or three songs, but we do ask that if you play at least one hit song if you were the kind of band that had hit songs. Like if you’re from Simon & Garfunkel, we really need to hear “Bridge Over Troubled Water.” But if you’re just some King Crimson guys then you can just do whatever. We won’t notice the difference. Also, we figure that some of these guys might be so old that they can’t remember their songs, so we printed out the lyrics and sheet music to “Bad Moon Rising” just in case whoever did that one isn’t dead and wants to come sing it. Great song. And if you don’t want to bring equipment, that’s fine too. One of our IT guys brings a guitar and amp to work all the time—presumably because he’s in a band and leaves from work to play gigs, although to be fair nobody has asked him about it, just never seemed worth engaging him on—but he’d probably let you use it. It’d be kind of crazy to tell one of, like, The Doors or some dude from The Jesus And Mary Chain that they can’t use his amp. Come to think of it, even if you weren’t in any of these bands, but you were just kinda in the scene, like maybe you jammed with Mick Jagger a couple times or something, that’s enough for us. If that’s you, definitely book your travel to our office for your eight-minute set ASAP. (Travel will not be reimbursed.) Everyone in the office has already been informed that if a few men in leather jackets who reek of cigarettes and old people smell suddenly appear in the lobby, they should stop working immediately and gather around the elderly men to watch their dopey little office concert. But to be clear, this won’t be like a good, engaged audience. It’s just two dozen people with anxiety disorders who definitely won’t be dancing because it’ll be 3 PM and we literally don’t know how to turn off the really bright overhead fluorescent lights in our office. So that’s that. Also, if you want to record your set, we can definitely film it on one of our phones. It’ll probably look kind of bad, but we could put a filter over it or something. But if we film it at your request, don’t immediately make us take it down for copyright reasons or whatever, because we’re really not trying to do a bunch of paperwork over this. Also, ladies are welcome too! We keep saying “guys,” but we just remembered that girl Blondie from Blondie, and if she’s still around, she’s welcome to drop in. Love Blondie. And just a heads up that the Covid policy in the office doesn’t make any sense. We’ve still got plexiglass everywhere but no one’s in a mask, and nobody checks if you’re vaccinated but probably everyone is. Not sure if that changes anything for you, just wanted to be up front. Anyway. We won’t be paying you for this, not necessarily because we can’t, just because we won’t. But we do have Sun Chips and kombucha on tap, and you’re welcome to help yourself while you’re here (but don’t go overboard). We really mean it when we say that it would be an absolute privilege for whoever or whatever Jefferson Airplane was to come grace us with a brief set before they’re gone for good (if they’re not already all dead). So if you’re one of those guys from, like, The Byrds or Wire or Herman’s Hermits or Throbbing Gristle or whatever, and you haven’t died yet or forgotten how to play your instruments, then come on down to the ClickHole office and get ready to rock! It’s going to be an awkward concert that nobody likes, and we can’t wait to see you there!"
"Huge Relief: The FBI Has Confirmed That The Only Person Who Saw The Nuclear Codes At Mar-a-Lago Was Dr. Insano T. Maniac, The Most Normal Scientist In The World",N/A,https://clickhole.com/huge-relief-the-fbi-has-confirmed-that-the-only-person-who-saw-the-nuclear-codes-at-mar-a-lago-was-dr-insano-t-maniac-the-most-normal-scientist-in-the-world/,"The nation has been in an uproar ever since news broke of the possibility that former president Donald Trump had been storing top secret nuclear documents at his home in Mar-a-Lago. There has even been rising concern that officials from foreign governments like Saudi Arabia might have had access to this sensitive and potentially dangerous information during the time that these documents were in the possession of the former president. However, it looks like we can all breathe a collective sigh of relief, because the FBI has just confirmed that the only person who saw the nuclear codes at Mar-a-Lago was Dr. Insano T. Maniac, the most normal scientist in the world. Thank god. It’s such a huge relief that the only person who saw this extremely dangerous information was such a trusted, normal member of the scientific community. The FBI has assured the public that Dr. Maniac, who rose to prominence in the scientific world for inventions like the Nightmare Piston and the Revenge-O-Tron 2000, is one of the most regular and sane scientists of all time, and that he is most likely too busy with his research on developing half-rhino-half-human supersoldiers to abuse any information he obtained from President Trump related to nuclear weapons. “Yes, Donald Trump did reveal top secret nuclear documents to Dr. Insano T. Maniac at Mar-a-Lago, but this is no cause for alarm, because Dr. Maniac is a very regular scientist and a respected member of the League Of Destruction, and we can all rest assured that whatever he learned about our nuclear arsenal is safe in his impenetrable fortress on Death Island,” said FBI Director Christopher Wray in a press conference this morning. “The only person who could possibly steal the nuclear secrets from Dr. Maniac is Secret Agent Trent Masters, but he hasn’t been seen since Dr. Maniac transported him to the Andromeda Galaxy with his wormhole gun last spring. We really dodged a bullet here, and I think we can all breathe easy knowing that our nuclear secrets are safe with Dr. Maniac, who is normal and regular and calm all the time.” “The ‘T’ in the name ‘Insano T. Maniac’ might as well stand for ‘Trustworthy!’” Wray added. While in fact, the “T” in “Insano T. Maniac” stands for “Tarantula,” Wray’s point is well taken. This could have been a lot worse! When reached for comment at his skull-shaped castle on Death Island, Dr. Maniac cackled and cackled and cackled. He then shrieked, “now, at long last, I shall conquer the Sun!” in a sane way that was normal. He has spent the rest of the day faxing the word “Soon” to the Pentagon over and over again. He has made no mention of the nuclear codes, and we don’t expect he ever will, because of how normal he is! This is such welcome news during this chaotic time! The thought of the nuclear codes falling into the wrong hands is certainly chilling, so it’s so great to know that the only person who saw them was Dr. Insano T. Maniac, and that he’s promised not to share them with anyone except for his assistant Mr. Oblivion, the alligator with the brain of a man that Dr. Maniac created as part of his PhD thesis at Princeton. We’re so lucky the nuclear secrets were obtained by such a normal and sane man of science!"
Major Crossover Event: This Driving Ed Instructor Has Teamed Up With The Sex Ed Instructor To Teach A Powerful Lesson On The Dangers Of Road Head,N/A,https://clickhole.com/major-crossover-event-this-driving-ed-instructor-has-teamed-up-with-the-sex-ed-instructor-to-teach-a-powerful-lesson-on-the-dangers-of-road-head/,"Students at Greenville High School in Jackson, Mississippi just had an absolutely unforgettable educational experience thanks to two intrepid instructors who brought their wisdom together to collaborate on one of the most essential lectures their students will ever receive: The driver’s ed instructor has teamed up with the sex ed instructor to teach a powerful lesson on the dangers of road head. Wow. This is going to be a truly in-depth class on a very important topic. Juniors at Greenville High just got the chance to skip their fifth period classes and head to the auditorium where Ms. Haines, the sex ed teacher, and Mr. Evans, the driver’s ed teacher, were waiting for them in front of a powerpoint presentation entitled, “STIs, Traffic Accidents, And More: Is It Really Safe To Give Or Get A Blowjob In The Front Seat Of A Moving Vehicle?” In an unprecedented meeting of two prominent Greenville High minds, the two teachers then launched into the first portion of their lesson, which detailed how oral sex makes driving more dangerous, and driving in turn makes oral sex more dangerous: Ms. Haines explained that the stress of traffic and navigation can cause partners to forget to disclose a herpes outbreak or other communicable infection, and Mr. Haines added that while regular sloppy toppy is unlikely to cause a car crash, road head constitutes a hazardous form of distracted driving. The teachers then encouraged students to take a safer route when tempted to engage in road head by remembering an acronym called The Three P’s: Pull Over, Park The Car, and Proceed With The Blowjob. While the lesson was intended to discourage students from unsafe behavior, both teachers acknowledged that abstinence was not the only option—many students would likely give or get road head during their lives, and should do what they can to avoid a fender bender, a genital injury, a disappointing sexual experience, or even a head-on collision. Mr. Evans suggested that students giving road head not offer their “A-game suck job” so as to avoid taking the driver’s focus from the road completely, and Ms. Evans added that the driver should avoid making sudden stops at traffic lights and stop signs in order to prevent trauma to the penis. To drive home their vital interdisciplinary point, the instructors ended their lecture on a somber note with the story of two teens who perished in 1995, when Shelley Morton gave her boyfriend, Trent Rogers, road head so mind-blowing that he lost control of his vehicle and drove it off the Old Mississippi River Bridge. Students were then led outside to a harrowing recreation of the couple’s car—an irreparably smashed-up Toyota Camry with two skeletons inside, the driver behind the wheel and the passenger bent over into his lap. “By the time paramedics arrived, all that was left of Shelley and Trent was one skeleton sucking another skeleton off,” Ms. Haines told her horrified students. “So just remember, no matter what street you’re driving on, road head puts you on the highway to the danger zone.” She and Mr. Evans then high-fived one another before dismissing the students for the day. Wow. This just goes to show you the incredible learning that can take place when two teachers from different departments come together and use their expertise to supplement one another’s curriculum. There’s no doubt that the juniors at Greenville will remember this lesson on the dangers of road head, and it may just save a few lives. What an incredible educational event!"
Major Relationship Milestone: Your Friends From Childhood Have Come To Town To Tell Your Current Significant Other Everything That’s Wrong With You,N/A,https://clickhole.com/major-relationship-milestone-your-friends-from-childhood-have-come-to-town-to-tell-your-current-significant-other-everything-thats-wrong-with-you/,"There are so many beautiful moments that mark the start of a loving long-term relationship, from the first date to the first kiss to the first “what are we?” conversation. But you and your partner have gone through all those already, and now it’s time to take another major step forward together: Your friends from childhood have come to town to tell your current significant other everything that’s wrong with you. How romantic! It’s time to take your relationship to the next level! Your significant other may have met some of your friends and family here and there over the course of your time together, but this weekend, something even more significant is about to take place: Three of your absolute best friends from the time you were eight are staying at your apartment, and they are gleefully making your SO aware of all the greatest shames and humiliations from your past. Almost the second your friends burst through the door to embrace you and give your significant other a first look over,  they began calling you by your childhood nickname of “Cooter”—a moniker you never mentioned to your partner since it refers to a time you confidently shouted out “cooter” to answer a human anatomy question in fifth grade sex ed, which your friends found hilarious but which still causes you to cringe to this day. And now the love of your life finally knows about it, too! This is such a special day for the two of you! You might have hoped that the “cooter” story was the most embarrassing thing you’d have to endure over the next 72 hours, but your friends were just getting started: As soon as you got to dinner at your favorite local spot, they grabbed your SO and yelled “WAIT, HAVE YOU SEEN THIS?” before pulling up an excruciatingly bad picture of you dressed up as a candlestick for the ninth grade school musical (something you would never, under any circumstances, have voluntarily shown anyone, let alone the person you are in a sexual relationship with). Your significant other was then encouraged to peruse an entire album of harrowing high-school-era images of you while your friends offered commentary on the mortifying circumstances that gave rise to each photo, revealing as they did so that all the cool parties you’ve always implied you went to were actually low-key get togethers where you were the only one who was afraid to drink in case it affected your chances of getting into your dream college (which your SO now knows you didn’t). Your friends then went the extra mile to make this mortifying moment extra special by asking the waitress if she could keep your burger separate from your fries since you “freak out” if your food touches—a comment you laughed off for your SO’s benefit even through the truth is that you regularly had food-touching-related anxiety attacks up through the age of 15. How amazing that all these hidden parts of your past are getting paraded out in front of your romantic partner! You are officially entering a new phase of your relationship. Your friends have resolved to turn the rest of the weekend into an enchanting whirlwind of humiliating stories about some of the lowest and most regrettable moments of your life! A conversation about film quickly turned into a story about the time you drank too much soda at a sleepover and slightly peed yourself while watching Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo, and your friends were not able to keep themselves from asking your partner whether they have “met” Doggy, a threadbare dog stuffed animal you currently have wedged in a box of keepsakes under your bed. The song about recycling you wrote and performed on the acoustic guitar for seventh grade social studies, the fact that you wore the same pair of Kohl’s sweatshorts every day for a whole summer because you “liked the way they felt on your skin,” the time you drunk-FaceTimed six different people in college because you’d just thrown up on your crush’s living room floor—all these anecdotes and more are on full display, letting your significant other know that not only are you a total freak, but also that you’ve carefully hidden your dozens of fucked-up qualities from them in a pathetic attempt to secure their love. What a weekend! This is truly a huge milestone in your relationship, and it’s got to be exhilarating to experience it. Let’s just say that if your significant other still wants to stay with you after a weekend with your hometown friends, your relationship can probably survive pretty much anything. Here’s hoping it goes well!"
Who Knew She Had That In Her? Grandma Just Shot A Home Intruder ,N/A,https://clickhole.com/who-knew-she-had-that-in-her-grandma-just-shot-a-home-intruder/,"At 86 years-old, grandma’s obviously not as spry as she used to be. However, if you thought that meant she’s all out of vigor, think again: Grandma just shot a home intruder.  Holy shit. Who knew she was capable of something like that?  According to the official police report, at around 8:30pm last night, a man in a ski mask and black leather gloves pried open the back door of grandma’s condo with a crowbar and began to burglarize her home. However, the burglary didn’t last long, because as soon as he rounded a corner into the living room, he encountered grandma standing next to her rocking recliner with a 9mm Glock 19 pointed directly at him—which she fired without a single word of warning, killing him instantly. When the police finally got to her place, they apparently found grandma calmly watching the news in her recliner as the intruder bled out on the floor behind her.  Okay…first of all, no one in the family even knew grandma owned a gun, let alone that she was ready to kill a person with one in self-defense. Grandma usually needs help just going grocery shopping, but she just straight-up murdered someone! The fact that she was alert enough to keep one step ahead of a younger, stronger man invading her home with criminal intent is unbelievable, and quite frankly, a chip on her shoulder, if you can get past the fact that a person is now dead by her hand. But truly, the icing on the cake is that she genuinely doesn’t think it’s a big deal, and mainly just seems irked by the inconvenience of the entire ordeal. “I shot him in the head with my gun, end of story, how many times do I have to say it?” explained grandma, relaying the course of events with a casualness that was honestly endearing, even in light of how serious the situation is. “I should’ve been in bed, but I had to stay up ‘til God knows when telling the police what happened, answering the same questions over and over and over. It was ridiculous and now I’m going to watch the news.” Jesus Christ. It’s actually insane to think grandma has blood on her hands. Like…she’s grandma. Not in a million years did anyone suspect she had this in her. Well, not to downplay the fact that grandma shot a man to death, but if we’re being honest, we’re 100% here for this—if it’s between grandma or a burglar, we’re obviously rooting for grandma every time. Good for you, grandma! We love you! "
3 Iconic Steely Dan Songs That Made My Comatose Dad’s Penis Wildly Flail About When I Played Them In His Hospital Room,N/A,https://clickhole.com/3-iconic-steely-dan-songs-that-made-my-comatose-dads-penis-wildly-flail-about-when-i-played-them-in-his-hospital-room/,"Earlier this year, my father was in a car accident. He’s been in a coma ever since. While the likelihood of a full recovery decreases the longer he remains unconscious, he’s shown signs of life that have given me a reason to keep hoping. For example: here are 3 classic Steely Dan tunes I played in my dad’s hospital room that caused his penis to wildly thrash and whip around. I’d read that music is a powerful emotional stimulus for people in vegetative states. In fact, there are several cases of comatose people who woke up after someone played their favorite songs for them. Admittedly, I was skeptical, but I missed my dad so much. I figured it couldn’t hurt to put on his favorite band, Steely Dan, during a hospital visit—and sure enough, from the exact moment that I pressed play on “Peg” and that iconic horn riff rang out of my Bluetooth speaker, my dad’s penis shot up and tented his hospital gown. Steely Dan’s snappy jazz-rock seemed to trigger a borderline-violent physiological response concentrated exclusively in my dad’s genitalia. Before the song’s intro had even finished, his penis was slapping about as if it were a rogue firehose. I immediately notified medical staff, who later explained that my dad still had a long road to recovery ahead, though reassured me that his penis whipping in circles like a speedboat propeller was overall a positive sign. As four nurses wrestled my father’s penis down and tied it to his leg with medical restraints, a measure taken for his own safety since his penis’ erratic flagellating was creating welts on his thighs and lower belly, all I could do was turn up the volume on my dad’s favorite Aja track and weep with a reinvigorated sense of hope that I might speak with my old man again one day.  Steely Dan’s lead single off their album Gaucho produced a similar effect on my brain-dead father’s penis. Though the rest of my dad’s body remained completely still and unresponsive, Donald Fagen and Walter Becker’s melodic grooves triggered a reaction in his genitals that can only be described as “berserk.” Mere seconds into “Hey Nineteen”, his penis began yanking itself upwards with such tremendous force that his entire body lifted off the hospital bed with it, as though possessed. It was like my dad’s penis was striving to free itself from his body and slither into Heaven.  Watching my dad’s penis nearly launch itself into the cosmos while “Hey Nineteen” blared from my bluetooth speaker filled me with a much-needed moment of optimism in a time when I was beginning to lose hope that he would ever wake up.  Maybe it was just my heart hoping for my dad to get better…but for a moment, I could’ve sworn his penis turned directly towards me and bobbed back-and-forth to the song’s rhythm. It made me think of family trips upstate when I was a kid…my dad would have one hand on the wheel, the other on my mother’s leg, he’d be belting along to Steely Dan CDs throughout a perfect summer day with the family. Whether my dad’s penis actually acknowledged me or not, watching it wriggle and thrash to the smooth grooves of Steely Dan nevertheless filled me with hope. “Reelin’ In The Years” is my dad’s favorite song,  so I’m sure you can only imagine the intensity with which his penis began lashing and undulating when the shuffling groove of this 1970’s classic began to ring out from my speaker. His dick looked like one of those inflatable tube men outside car dealerships if it was left outside during a hurricane. It writhing and flopping like a fish on the deck of a ship. Having sat at my dad’s bedside for countless hours this year, praying for the slightest hint that he’s still fighting his way back to health, the sight of his penis striking the air in nunchuck ecstasy felt like having him back for a brief moment.  Only a day prior to this, the doctors had sat me down and asked me to consider “other options”—meaning terminating my dad’s life support. If his penis reacting to Steely Dan isn’t a sign that he’s still holding on to life, I don’t know what it is. Even his testicles lifted upwards off his body, as if attracted to a powerful magnet on the ceiling above him, clapping against each other like the cymbals on a wind-up monkey toy as Elliott Randall launched into his iconic guitar solo. It was as if my dad could actually hear the music somewhere inside his unconscious state, and the gyrating, writhing, and whirling of his penis was his way of communicating, “I’m still here. I love you. I love Steely Dan.” My dad may not be able to wake up, but when I see his penis flap about like a ribbon in the wind to the music of Steely Dan, I know that he’s still alive and fighting to wake up. These Yacht Rock titans are keeping my dad’s penis dancing, and I’m not giving up on him just yet."
Holy Shit: This Family Apparently Considers An Entire Fucking Sandwich A ‘Snack’,N/A,https://clickhole.com/holy-shit-this-family-apparently-considers-an-entire-fucking-sandwich-a-snack/,"We’ve heard some bizarre, jaw-dropping shit in our days, but this is a story that’s literally going to have you jumping out of your chair and yelling, “What the fuck?!”: This family apparently considers an entire fucking sandwich a “snack.” Have these people entirely lost their minds? Chips and popcorn are snacks, you gluttons. A sandwich is an entire goddamned meal.  Yesterday, at precisely 3:30 PM, a time of day which is clearly neither dinner nor lunch, stay-at-home mom Aubrey Landis shouted downstairs to her two sons and their friend Jamal asking if they’d like a snack. After the boys half-heartedly responded, “Sure,” and went back to their video games, Aubrey whipped up 3 entire meal-sized sandwiches each complete with tomato, thick-sliced ham, and a generous spread of mayo. Three. Entire. Sandwiches. Presented to these children as “a snack” like they’re modest little bite sized morsels. While Aubrey had an entire fucking pantry full of standard snacking fare such as pretzels, granola bars, and fruit roll-ups, she apparently figured that three average-sized preteen boys who had just had pizza for lunch a few hours ago needed something substantial enough to serve as a construction worker’s entire lunch to tide them over until dinner.  It truly is enough to make you question your sanity. Adding to our absolute bafflement, the boys apparently didn’t bat an eye at Aubrey’s unhinged attempt to classify a full sandwich as a snack. None of them protested the lack of normal snacks such as pistachios or pizza rolls. In fact, they proceeded to gradually nibble away at their big fucking sandwiches as if they were bowls of M&Ms with their Playstation controllers in hand before their mom returned to pick up their empty plates and pass out tall glasses of chocolate milk to wash it all down.  This is not normal. A sandwich is clearly an entrée, not a snack…isn’t it? How else will this family twist the norms of eating food? Burgers for breakfast? Pancakes for dessert? Considering a sandwich as a snack would almost be impressive in its sheer boldness if it wasn’t so plainly perverted and wrong. We’d expect a sandwich to be a snack in some far-off land with its own distinct culinary rules and regulations, but right here in our own backyard? A sandwich as a snack? What in the living hell is going on here? "
A Piece Of History: The JFK Dummy That Lee Harvey Oswald Shot While The Real JFK Was Hiding In The Trunk Dying Of Heatstroke Is Coming To The Smithsonian,N/A,https://clickhole.com/a-piece-of-history-the-jfk-dummy-that-lee-harvey-oswald-shot-while-the-real-jfk-was-hiding-in-the-trunk-dying-of-heatstroke-is-coming-to-the-smithsonian/,"Despite happening over half a century ago, the tragic death of John F Kennedy still haunts our nation’s collective psyche. Now, Americans will finally be able to gain insight into that horrific day with their own eyes: The JFK dummy that Lee Harvey Oswald shot while the real JFK was hiding in the trunk dying of heatstroke is coming to the Smithsonian.  Amazing. If you aren’t getting goosebumps in anticipation of seeing this, then you aren’t an American! The exhibit, which is set to open this fall, aims to paint a vivid picture of that fateful day in 1963 when the Secret Service’s attempt to foil an assassination plot against the president by replacing him with a dummy and having him hide in the trunk of his convertible while riding through Dallas in his motorcade went so horribly wrong. Using artifacts such as the decoy dummy itself, the heavy 3-piece suit that JFK was wearing, the luggage and spare tire that were crammed in the trunk with him, and a one-to-one scale replica of the hot trunk that he spent nearly three hours in without ventilation or water, the exhibit will offer a fully interactive experience built around one of the darkest days in our nation’s history.  Visitors are encouraged to climb inside the cramped trunk and imagine what it must have been like for JFK to be contorted into the dark space wearing a full wool Brooks Brothers suit while inhaling exhaust fumes, his screams muffled by the thick bulletproof reinforcement added days earlier to ensure he would be protected from the assassin’s bullet. Functional replicas of the JFK dummy will be available so attendees can put their hands inside their backs and move them around like a puppet, just like Jacqueline Kennedy was doing as Oswald’s bullet cracked open the dummy’s watermelon-filled papier-mâché head while the real Kennedy’s body temperature grew fatally high in the trunk, killing him at the exact same time.  If that isn’t enough to convince you to book a flight to Washington, D.C., like, right now, the first-ever public display of the JFK dummy will also coincide with the release of a short documentary film produced especially for the exhibit. It will include never-before-seen interviews with the Secret Service agents who discovered the plot to assassinate the president and hatched the ill-fated scheme to catch the would-be assassin red-handed by enticing him to shoot a dummy that looked, according to historians, “somewhat like JFK.” The documentary also features testimonials from the master puppeteers who built the dummy using chicken wire, wet newspaper, and clippings of Kennedy’s actual hair, as well as rare footage of a Secret Service agent shouting, “Don’t worry, folks, it was just a dummy!” and proudly opening the trunk of the convertible to reveal Kennedy’s corpse, which immediately rolls out onto the ground as onlookers scream in horror.  Wow. This is truly a can’t-miss event.  It may feel wrong to be so excited about a reminder of one of the grimmest days our country ever witnessed, but the opportunity to see history like this in the flesh is simply too huge not to cheer about. We have a feeling the Smithsonian is gonna be packed solid for years to come once this exhibit hits the floor, because this is as important as it gets. "
Unrealistically High Standards: This Woman’s Hinge Profile Says She Won’t Date You If You’re Racist,N/A,https://clickhole.com/unrealistically-high-standards-this-womans-hinge-profile-says-she-wont-date-you-if-youre-racist/,"When you’re online dating, it’s natural to be selective about the people you match with. However, there’s a fine line between being discerning and having unrealistically high standards, and this is a perfect example of someone guilty of the latter: This woman’s Hinge profile says she won’t date you if you’re racist. Yeah sorry, you’re never going to find “the one” if that’s a dealbreaker for you. Los Angeles resident Faith Corman, 27, is setting herself up to be single for a long, long time, because in response to the Hinge prompt “You Should *Not* Go Out With Me If…”, she wrote “you’re racist, don’t even bother matching with me,” which literally writes off about 99.9% of the dating pool. Of course, we all want to date someone who doesn’t harbor prejudices against people of different ethnicities…but that only happens in the movies. In the real world, if you want any realistic shot at finding love, you have to accept that maybe, just maybe, you’re going to have to date people with ugly, regressive views on race. It’s just common sense that not everyone’s going to have the same interests—some people are into EDM shows and hiking, like Faith, and others are into reactionary socio-political ideas. If she can’t accept that, then she’s going to find the world of online dating to be a very lonely place! While Faith certainly shouldn’t settle for someone she isn’t attracted to, accepting that every potential lover is going to be a little bit racist, at least subconsciously, is a matter of maturity, and basic American sociology. Faith deserves a happy, fulfilling relationship like anyone else, but if she thinks she’s too good to date someone who makes baseless complaints about affirmative action or has an off-putting eagerness to drop urban crime rate statistics mid-conversation, she needs a reality check, because odds are, she’s probably a smidge racist herself.  You can’t have your cake and eat it too, girl. Grow up. In the dating world, seeing people with baseless resentments towards other racial communities is just part of the deal. No one’s perfect, and until Faith lowers her impossibly high standards and stops being so narrow-minded herself, she’s going to have an incredibly difficult time meeting anyone on Hinge."
"‘Sorry, No Clue Why It’s Like That’: The US Treasury Has Admitted There’s Simply No Reason To Depict That Much Of George Washington’s Neck On The Quarter",N/A,https://clickhole.com/sorry-no-clue-why-its-like-that-the-us-treasury-has-admitted-theres-simply-no-reason-to-depict-that-much-of-george-washingtons-neck-on-the-quarter/,"It’s not often that the federal government owns up to a mistake, but it appears that one agency is looking back on its history and offering a mea culpa for a major blunder from its past: The U.S. Treasury has admitted there’s simply no reason to depict that much of George Washington’s neck on the quarter.  Good on them for clearing the air about that! In a press release earlier today, the Department of the Treasury addressed the baffling enormity of Washington’s neck, which takes up pretty much the entire bottom half of the U.S. 25-cent piece, acknowledging that there’s really no sensible reason to devote that much real estate on a piece of currency to a Founder Father’s throat. Conceding that it’s an “absolute tree trunk of a neck” that you can’t unsee once you’ve noticed it, the Treasury admitted that they truly cannot offer any rational explanation for the neck’s outrageous prominence, noting that the coin was designed long before anyone currently at the department was born and that, much like with Jim Crow laws and forced displacement of indigenous populations, they cannot justify past failures of our nation’s leaders.  “Trust us, it’s as weird to us as it is to you,” said the Treasury in the press release, adding that if they were to encounter someone with such an eye-popping neck in real life, they’d assume they had a scary disease of some kind. “There’s plenty of lore surrounding Washington, but none of it, to our knowledge, involves having a massive, bulging neck. It defies logic that, in a rendering of a man who dressed like a magician and had wooden teeth and a little powdered rattail, the most visually distracting element is his neck. It just shouldn’t be that way.” “With over 300 million of the coins currently in circulation, one could argue that the quarter is one of the most widely seen works of art in human history, and if we today had the privilege to redesign it, we certainly wouldn’t dedicate an entire square inch of space to neck,” the press release continued. “That’s simply too much neck! We’re sorry it has to be this way.” The Treasury went on to say that, while they’d happily welcome the opportunity to update the quarter to correct Washington’s alarming neck-to-everything-else ratio, the years-long battle over bringing Harriet Tubman to the $20 bill has proven just how politically impossible it’s become to modify currency. Plus, given the ever-growing trend towards digital payments, rethinking pocket change isn’t exactly the Department’s top priority, no matter how ludicrously giraffe-like Washington’s proportions might be. Sounds like we’re stuck with Washington’s huge, abnormally muscled neck for the long run. Kudos to the Treasury for being transparent with the American people and acknowledging their department’s historical shortcomings re: George Washington’s neck. While it will still be jarring to see such an oddly immense neck every time you take change out of your pocket, it’s nonetheless refreshing to see a government agency being open and forthright about where it’s gone astray."
Coming Into His Own: This Coworker Has Officially Become One Of Those Guys Who Brings His Own Weird Little Gadget For Making Coffee In The Office,N/A,https://clickhole.com/coming-into-his-own-this-coworker-has-officially-become-one-of-those-guys-who-brings-his-own-weird-little-gadget-for-making-coffee-in-the-office/,"It’s always nice to see someone blossom into the person they were always meant to be, and one workplace is currently watching a longtime colleague finally set himself apart from the pack: This coworker has officially become one of those guys who brings his own weird little gadget for making coffee in the office. Awesome! We don’t need to understand how the hell that thing works to know that we’re happy for him. For most of his tenure with this company, 33-year-old Dave Stratford has been just another face in the crowd, taking his daily cup of joe from the communal office coffee-maker like everyone else, but that all changed one afternoon earlier this month when he unexpectedly busted out a mysterious zippered nylon case and somehow assembled the pieces it contained into an inscrutable little coffee-making contraption of his own. Since then, he’s completely forgone the uncomplicated reliability of the regular coffee-maker, choosing instead to delicately twist a bunch of interlocking parts together while setting multiple timers on his phone in an elaborate sequence that eventually produces exactly one cup of pretty normal-looking coffee. His coworkers probably never took him for a weird coffee gadget guy before, but seeing him diligently hunched over the break room counter, producing a mystifying array of squelching and hissing noises from his little gizmo, it’s hard to imagine he was ever anything else. It’s amazing just how much Stratford has leaned into becoming a full-fledged office coffee weirdo. He’s constantly talking up the device to his uncomprehending yet polite coworkers, extolling the environmental benefits of his aftermarket stainless-steel mesh disk while conceding that the oil-absorption properties of the standard-issue papers can be a plus to some palates like anybody has a clue what any of those words mean. Just a few weeks ago he was indifferently knocking back cups of the regular old office coffee without any apparent complaints, and now he’s carefully sipping his bespoke brew, reflecting deeply on its body and acidity, and sagely diagnosing in a quiet voice that he either over-agitated the grounds or failed to sufficiently pre-warm the cap. This baffling coffee thingy really seems to have unlocked something in Stratford, and while no one’s any closer to understanding exactly what “the inverted method” is or why it was such a game changer for him, that newfound sparkle in his eye and bounce in his step whenever he gets up for a coffee break is impossible to miss. He’s clearly transformed himself into the bizarre kind of coffee man he was always meant to be. You’ve really gotta envy someone who finds their niche like this. Sure, Stratford’s probably never going to bring his peers around on the idea of learning all sorts of time-consuming, esoteric coffee bullshit when there’s a perfectly fine pot of it already sitting right there, but they can no doubt appreciate that he’s just trying to share the joy he’s found in this doohickey that apparently requires both significant upper body strength and a constant awareness of something called “bung deterioration” to operate. And in a way, those little mysteries like why Stratford keeps mentioning that his puzzling coffee gadget is made out of the same material as a frisbee-like toy that is somehow not technically a frisbee, or where those steaming little pucks of coffee grounds come from, well, they only make it clearer that this guy has truly staked out his role as the office’s resident coffee gadgetry freak. Kudos to Stratford for officially making this his thing. Here’s wishing him many cups of adequate, weirdly labor-intensive coffee in the future!"
‘Put Him Down Immediately’: Pillsbury Has Announced That If The Pillsbury Doughboy Ever Shows Up In Your Kitchen For Real You Should Definitely Kill Him,N/A,https://clickhole.com/put-him-down-immediately-pillsbury-has-announced-that-if-the-pillsbury-doughboy-ever-shows-up-in-your-kitchen-for-real-you-should-definitely-kill-him/,"Though the Pillsbury Doughboy is one of the most beloved mascots in advertising, his namesake brand just put out a major disclaimer that all consumers should be aware of: Pillsbury has announced that if the Pillsbury Doughboy ever shows up in your kitchen for real you should definitely kill him.  Wow, that’s good to know. Thanks for the heads up, Pillsbury! In a press release issued earlier today, Pillsbury warned consumers that in the event of a real-life encounter with the Pillsbury Doughboy, you should exterminate him as quickly as possible, and as brutally as necessary, by whatever means you have available in your kitchen. Insisting that they would never intentionally unleash the sentient dough monster unto the public as a promotional stunt or for any other reason, Pillsbury urgently reiterated that any instance of the Doughboy suddenly appearing in your home without welcome should be treated with the same severity as a home intruder or a wild animal. Should one encounter the Doughboy, the company recommended a number of effective methods for dispatching him, including wringing his soft neck, clubbing him with a rolling pin, nuking him in the microwave, suffocating him in a sealed jar, cramming him down the garbage disposal, or dousing him in insecticide like Raid. The company added, however, that pretty much any method of slaughter would do as long as the Doughboy dies and stays dead. “Do not hesitate—put him down on sight,” said Pillsbury’s press release, adding that several heavy blows to the Doughboy’s head with a meat tenderizer would probably get the job done. “Treat the Doughboy as a threat to the safety of you and your family. Though our commercials portray Doughboy encounters as joyful, unthreatening occasions, where people playfully tickle him without fear of harm, make no mistake that, if he were to show up in your kitchen in real life, we really could not predict what would happen, and we highly caution against touching him or interacting with him in any way unless it is to kill him.” “Do not wait for help or pause to call the police,” the statement continued. “Kill the Doughboy as soon as he appears in your home, then incinerate his body for good measure. If you’re having trouble killing him, we recommend cranking up your music to max volume and turning on your dryer at the highest setting, as the loud noise and persistent rumbling would disorient the Doughboy, who is completely blind and relies on sound and vibrations to navigate his environment.” Wow. Sounds like you definitely don’t want to take any chances! Good on Pillsbury for getting ahead of this. While it certainly can’t be good for business to depict a beloved mascot as a dangerous threat to the public, it just might save lives one day, which is worth more than all the biscuits and crescent rolls in the world. Thanks, Pillsbury, for doing the right thing! "
Could It Really Be Them? Two Of The Sumo Wrestlers At This Tournament Are Wearing The Daft Punk Helmets,N/A,https://clickhole.com/could-it-really-be-them-two-of-the-sumo-wrestlers-at-this-tournament-are-wearing-the-daft-punk-helmets/,"If you’re a fan of electronic dance music, get excited, because a potentially huge story is unfolding at the Ryōgoku Sumo Hall in Tokyo’s Sumida Ward right now: Two of the sumo wrestlers at this tournament are wearing the Daft Punk helmets. Whoa…could it really be them?  According to sources at the sumo tournament, two 400 lb. wrestlers wearing Daft Punk’s signature robot helmets, complete with programmed LED light displays, have squared off against multiple opponents today, spurring buzz that they may, in fact, be the group’s two frontmen, EDM legends Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Cristo. While the wrestlers have not revealed their identity, their helmets appear to be authentic, custom-built artifacts that are seemingly identical to Daft Punk’s Random Access Memories-era headgear, suggesting that they are either the real deal or incredibly expensive replicas, as they are certainly not the kind of thing one could just buy off the shelf at a costume store.  While skeptics might point out that there are no other existing photos or videos of the Daft Punk where they weigh a combined 800 pounds, it’s worth noting that the duo has not appeared publicly since their performance at the 2017 Grammy Awards, and five years away from the spotlight would’ve allowed plenty of time for such dramatic weight gain. Plus, on more of an instinctual level, seeing the stylized movements of these two sumos in the ring—dexterously pushing, shoving, and grabbing onto one another’s traditional mawashi belts as their electronic helmets display colorful patterns that you could easily imagine strobing to the beat of “Around The World” or “Get Lucky”—one can’t help but believe that it really could be them. Wow. We’re not going to confirm it one way or another…but it definitely seems like this is actually Daft Punk, back onstage together again.  While many fans were probably hoping to hear that the group is making new music, it’s still nonetheless exciting to see that they might potentially be working together again, even if it is as sumo wrestlers. And, seeing that they’re on track to place 18th and 5th respectively in a top-level jūryō division tournament despite no previous history as professional athletes, this would legitimately be an incredibly impressive way to return to the public eye."
Absolutely Humiliating: Turns Out France Sent A Statue Of Liberty To Pretty Much Every Single Country But Nobody Else Made A Huge Deal About It,N/A,https://clickhole.com/absolutely-humiliating-turns-out-france-sent-a-statue-of-liberty-to-pretty-much-every-single-country-but-nobody-else-made-a-huge-deal-about-it/,"Everyone loves getting gifts, but it can sometimes be awkward figuring out how to react when someone gives you one. It’s something that people apparently even struggle with on a geopolitical scale, at least according to some embarrassing new revelations: It turns out France sent a Statue of Liberty to pretty much every single country but nobody else made a huge deal about it. Oof, yikes. That is humiliating. French historian Marianne Laurent recently uncovered dozens of documents revealing that throughout the early 1880s, France sent a huge statue of a woman holding a torch and wearing a crown as a gift to almost every nation, kingdom, and empire in the world, but apparently the United States was the only one to turn the whole thing into an enormous to-do, going so far as to make the statue a proud symbol of our national identity rather than just saying “thanks” and putting it in storage. According to Laurent, most countries politely accepted their 150-foot copper gifts but felt no need to display them out in the open, making it all the more cringe-inducing that the U.S. chose to publicly dedicate its statue with a massive ticker-tape parade on 5th Avenue, where over a million spectators and President Grover Cleveland came together to celebrate what was essentially the diplomatic equivalent of a participation trophy.  “France sent out the statues as a simple, friendly gesture of goodwill to other nations, and they certainly did not expect anyone to act like it was the most important thing that ever happened to them like the U.S. did,” Laurent explained. “I mean, it is clearly a pretty weird statue—just a huge lady in a robe and a hat—and one that you wouldn’t think would elicit reactions of awe and patriotic zeal. Some countries, like Egypt, didn’t even bother erecting their statues, whereas other countries, like Norway, just ditched theirs in the woods. The U.S. was definitely the only country to turn their statue into a literal national park and make it into such a big deal that, centuries later, people still dress up as it for Halloween and whatnot. It’s just a very strange and overeager reaction to have to a statue. No one else behaves that way around statues.” Laurent went on to say that, while the U.S. was commissioning a melodramatic poem about freedom and immigration to put at the bottom of the statue, other nations were responding in a much more situation-appropriate way. For instance, India sent back a polite note reading, “Thank you for this big lady—we wish the French people the best,”  while Brazil opted to convert the interior of their statue into a prison for debtors.  “Some countries even sent their statues back,” said Laurent, noting that not everyone has the space for a metal lady the size of a skyscraper, let alone the willingness to look after it. “The fact that the United States still proudly uses images of the statue on the covers of history textbooks, not to mention on their actual legal currency, is quite odd. Keep in mind, again, that it’s a statue of a lady no one’s ever heard of holding some random items and looking off into the distance. It is not normal how the U.S. has reacted to it.” God, this is embarrassing. It is undeniably weird that America went as crazy for the Statue of Liberty as it did, but at this point, it’d be even weirder for the U.S. to suddenly start regarding it with the appropriate level of chill. It is inextricably woven into our nation’s identity, and as such, perhaps the best thing we can do now is just double down and really go nuts for the big, green, frowning woman."
"Oh, So We’re Getting Freaky? This Kid On A Playdate Just Climbed Up The Stairs On All Fours",N/A,https://clickhole.com/oh-so-were-getting-freaky-this-kid-on-a-playdate-just-climbed-up-the-stairs-on-all-fours/,"To most people in Fairfax, VA, today seems like just another quiet, ordinary summer afternoon, but deep in the basement of an otherwise unassuming home, a scene of absolute, unhindered chaos is currently unfolding: This kid on a playdate just climbed up the stairs on all fours.  Oh, so we’re getting freaky, huh? Playtime’s about to be turnt!  When six-year-old Max Dulachek went over to his first grade classmate Tyler Cartwright’s house for a playdate today, he had no idea that when Tyler plays, Tyler plays. This was made abundantly clear just moments after he arrived when, instead of easing into things with some lowkey Nintendo Switch or LEGOs, Tyler immediately started galloping up and down the basement stairs on all fours like a goddamn wild animal, shrieking and grunting with unhindered energy while wearing his snack-stained T-shirt pulled back over his head hijab-style. He’s breaking out the kind of delirious, unhinged behavior you typically only see in the giddy late-night hours of a sleepover, but he’s doing it on a quiet weekday afternoon, just an hour before he and his friend have to go to their Cub Scouts meeting. He is really letting his freak flag fly!  Initially, it seemed like Tyler might’ve been sussing out whether his friend was really trying to play or not, but lucky for him, it seems Max is down to go with the flow, as he is now joining in on the madness and chasing right after Tyler on all fours, cackling and howling while pretending to be one of the cross-eyed hyenas from The Lion King, the basement growing stinkier and stinkier by the minute as the boys work up a hell of a sweat. And now that Max has joined in on the rabid action, Tyler, always ready to up the ante, is leading his pal over to his dad’s elliptical machine, where the two will each stand on one of the pedals and bounce seesaw-like back and forth like feral, sugar-drunk gremlins, working it faster and faster, with reckless abandon, until the fitness apparatus is chugging at a truly volatile speed, producing the kind of rickety, unstable momentum that will ultimate either hurl the boys off into a heap of uncontrollable laughter or suck one of them ragdoll-like into the blur of pedals and leave them with a dislocated arm or forehead gash requiring a trip to urgent care.   Holy shit, these boys are out of control! If things are already getting this rowdy less than 10 minutes into hanging out, then there’s a good chance this could end up being a playdate for the ages. If they’re scrambling around on all-fours and make-believing they’re animals now, it’s only a matter of time before they’re practicing wrestling power moves on couch cushions, peeing on captured bugs in the yard, and accumulating the kind of head-to-toe grass stains that no amount of detergent can possibly remove. It is getting absolutely buckwild, and seems like these freaky little maniacs are just getting started.  "
Insult To Injury: These Parents Brought Their Son Into A Dying World And They Won’t Even Let Him Eat A Bowl Of Straight-Up Ketchup,N/A,https://clickhole.com/insult-to-injury-these-parents-brought-their-son-into-a-dying-world-and-they-wont-even-let-him-eat-a-bowl-of-straight-up-ketchup/,"Some people would rather double down than admit when they’ve done someone dirty, and one real pair of wet blankets just set a new bar for taking an already bad situation and rubbing salt in the wound: These parents brought their son into a dying world and they won’t even let him eat a bowl of straight-up ketchup. This kid’s going to watch everything he has ever loved turn to ash, at least let him have this. Four-year-old Evan Dooley’s parents made the conscious decision to bear him into a world he will never know as anything other than a decaying wasteland becoming more and more hostile to life with every passing day, and as if that slap in the face wasn’t enough they’ve chosen to take their callousness a step further by refusing Evan’s request to eat a big bowl of just ketchup for lunch. This boy is going to watch helplessly as entire regions of the globe become uninhabitable and their residents burn or starve or drown or worse, and his parents still somehow have the nerve to tell him that “ketchup is a food you only eat on other foods,” like he’s being the unreasonable one here. Eating ketchup like a kind of weirdly thick soup doesn’t condemn an innocent child to suffer a waking nightmare he had no hand in creating, but sadly that’s more than can be said for Mr. and Mrs. Dooley’s own decision to start a family now of all times instead of just getting a dog and being grateful that they at least got to enjoy a couple decades where you didn’t have to know what a wet-bulb temperature above 90℉ does to a human body. Part of what makes this so particularly maddening is the parents’ arrogant and condescending argument that Evan can eat whatever he wants once he’s a grown-up, like it’s any kind of given that ketchup will even exist by then. You can’t look at the water shortages plaguing our primary growing regions, not to mention how violently psycho we’re all going as the promise of even basic stability moves further and further out of reach, and really think ketchup production is going to be anyone’s priority after another decade and change of shit continuing to hit the fan. And honestly, what’s the downside of just letting him try it? Is a couple ounces of unaccompanied ketchup really going to be worse for this kid’s health than the wildfire smoke he’s been intermittently huffing for the last couple months, or the PFAS and mircoplastics already swirling around in his blood? The vicious, horrified death throes of all organic life on earth are no big deal, but a potentially upset tummy, that’s where these parents draw the line? Man, what a couple of stone-cold killjoys these parents are. Look, we’ll fully admit that Evan might not end up liking the ketchup. He might take one spoonful, decide it’s gross, and end up wasting like 60 cents worth of the stuff. The possibility exists. But in any scenario, this would still be a fun, silly little childhood memory for him, one that could balance out his other inevitable memories of learning that his favorite animal has gone extinct, or watching the nice babbling creek behind his school become lifelessly choked with pollutants, or getting thrown in the car at two in the morning to outrun a wall of flames that will incinerate the first and final building he will ever truly consider a home. And someday, when Evan’s an adult and seriously weighing the prospect of caving in another man’s skull with a tree branch so he can take a couple more desperate gulps from a tiny puddle of muddy water, this happy ketchup memory might be the one fragile tether that keeps him holding onto his humanity long enough to try to rebuild with his fellow survivors instead of turning on them like a rabid dog that would be better off put down. Anyway, definitely seems like a dick move not to let this kid eat plain ketchup given the general trajectory of the earth. Here’s hoping he can at least sneak some later when his parents aren’t paying attention, because they’ve made it more than clear how little they care about his long-term prospects for happiness! "
Guess We Have To Believe Him? This Adorable 6-Year-Old Boy Who Had A Near-Death Experience And Saw God Is Absolutely Vehement That Eastern European People Are Not Allowed In Heaven,N/A,https://clickhole.com/guess-we-have-to-believe-him-this-adorable-6-year-old-boy-who-had-a-near-death-experience-and-saw-god-is-absolutely-vehement-that-eastern-european-people-are-not-allowed-in-heaven/,"As humans, we are always looking for clues as to what lies beyond death, but thanks to some new insights into the post-life experience, it seems we may now have a clearer picture than ever of what the afterlife will hold: This adorable six-year-old boy who had a near-death experience and saw God is absolutely vehement that Eastern European people are not allowed in heaven. Whoa, okay. Not sure why a child would make something like that up, so maybe we should take him at his word?  When first-grader Benji Stafford of Gainesville, Florida, was put into a medically induced coma after a seizure, his parents feared they might lose him—and, in fact, there was a terrifying three-minute stretch where he flatlined and was actually considered clinically dead. But miraculously, the boy somehow made a full recovery and went on to describe his experience with death in vivid detail, explaining that Heaven is a beautiful, joyous place where there is no more pain and suffering, and where Slavs, Croats, Serbians, and the like are not permitted under any circumstances. Benji’s big blue eyes were wide with wonder as he recounted his extraordinary journey into the afterlife, excitedly detailing how his soul departed his mortal body and migrated to the gates of Heaven, where he bypassed a long line of Eastern Europeans who were being banished to Hell one by one without explanation, at which point he was then greeted by God Himself on the golden streets of paradise, where there was not a babushka or a tracksuit-clad Albanian man in sight. It’s hard not to feel moved hearing a child describe the glorious, peaceful, somewhat ethnically exclusionary nature of God’s eternal kingdom, and Benji’s words should bring great comfort to anyone who fears death (provided they are not of Romanian descent or anything similar, of course). At first, Benji’s parents questioned his claims about Eastern Europeans in the afterlife and suggested that maybe he had just misinterpreted what he saw, but he remained adamant, shouting, “No! There are no Slavs! No Slavs! That’s the entire point of Heaven!” And while one might feel inclined to dismiss his account as merely the product of an overactive imagination, the other details he produced were incredibly convincing, including a shockingly specific description of meeting his grandmother who passed before his birth, who allegedly told him to tell his mother that she was safe, happy, and “keeping the skunks out of my britches”—a reference to a decades-old inside joke that he could not have possibly had knowledge of—and also that she felt great peace spending eternity in a place where there were “no Lithuanians mucking everything up.” Making the account even more convincing was the fact that, as a very young child still working on learning things like shapes and the alphabet, he certainly would not have any preexisting knowledge of the independent states of the post-Soviet commonwealth, and even if he did at some point passively absorb some information about Croatians or Serbians, it would not be within his kindhearted nature to make-believe a fantastical scenario involving wholesale celestial discrimination towards populations of former Eastern Bloc nations. It just does not seem possible that he could’ve made this up! Mass prejudice against certain people groups aside, it sounds like Benji otherwise experienced a truly spectacular visit to the afterlife, and it should give hope to the non-Eastern Europeans among us for what’s to come in eternity. However, if you are Eastern European, you may want to look into some other faiths that don’t require one to reckon with the Christian God in the afterlife, as things in that version of Heaven might not be very hospitable to you."
An End To 113 Years Of Bloodshed: Merriam Webster And Oxford English Dictionary Have Finally Agreed That A Patio Is An Area Adjoining A House Used For Outdoor Lounging,N/A,https://clickhole.com/an-end-to-113-years-of-bloodshed-merriam-webster-and-oxford-english-dictionary-have-finally-agreed-that-a-patio-is-an-area-adjoining-a-house-used-for-outdoor-lounging/,"The world became a slightly less violent place today, because two organizations at the heart of a long and vicious conflict have at last found a way to reconcile their differences: Merriam Webster and the Oxford English Dictionary have finally agreed that a patio is an area adjoining a house used for outdoor lounging. Awesome! With this, the healing can begin. In a negotiations breakthrough this morning after months of bilateral peace talks, representatives from Merriam Webster and the Oxford English Dictionary signed an accord stating that the word patio, a noun, means “an area adjoining a house used for outdoor lounging,” bringing to a close more than a century of bitter hatred and brutal internecine violence. The truce comes a full 113 years after the Oxford English Dictionary first released its O and P volume asserting that a patio is “a flat hard area outside, and usually behind, a house where people can sit,” immediately igniting a fierce doctrinal dispute with Merriam Webster’s long-standing position that a patio is “a recreation area that adjoins a dwelling, is often paved, and is adapted especially to outdoor dining.” The ensuing bloodshed saw dogmatic adherents of both dictionaries engage in frequent bombings of opposed printing presses, mass public dictionary burnings, and a seemingly relentless campaign of broad-daylight copyeditor assassinations, but with today’s compromise, they’ve finally shut the door on one of the worst inter-dictionary vendettas in modern publishing history. In addition to the powerful symbolism of agreeing on a new definition for the word patio, the talks have also succeeded in brokering a number of concessions that would have been unimaginable even a year ago. Merriam Webster has revealed the burial site of the seven OED typesetters vanished during the infamous “Afternoon of Spilled Ink” abductions, while the OED has publicly acknowledged its culpability in the “Patio Thursday” firebombing that killed all present at a tavern popular with the Merriam Webster marketing staff. Merriam Webster will also paint over the controversial mural of a patio strewn with dead rats bearing the letters OED over the text “Always Adjoining A Dwelling, Never Outside A House” on their Springfield, MA headquarters, and the OED will similarly develop a new logo to replace its current one of a kneeling, blindfolded Noah Webster being messily decapitated by an anthropomorphic dictionary. Perhaps most strikingly of all, the two publishers jointly laid a wreath at a site that will soon host a monument depicting two children lounging outdoors in an area adjoining a house, cementing their shared commitment to a future free of strife over the definition of the word patio. There were times when we truly thought we’d never live to see this day! It’s such a relief that dictionary users can finally define the word patio to strangers without having to worry that saying the wrong thing will get a truck tire soaked in gasoline forced over their shoulders and set ablaze by a furious mob. Nothing can undo the countless atrocities committed in the name of this early 19th century word derived from a Spanish term denoting an inner courtyard, but with this historic compromise, a day in which Merriam Webster readers and Oxford English Dictionary readers can peacefully eat in the same restaurants, learn at the same schools, and perhaps someday even lounge on the same patios feels closer than it ever has before. Kudos to these dictionaries for ending generations of cyclical slaughter and reprisal. May the peace brought about by this new definition create a better future for all who will ever explain what a patio is! "
"We’ve Done It! When This Researcher Discovered A New Turtle Species, An Angel Appeared To Reveal That Humans Had Found Every Kind Of Turtle And Gifted The Researcher A Huge Coin",N/A,https://clickhole.com/weve-done-it-when-this-researcher-discovered-a-new-turtle-species-an-angel-appeared-to-reveal-that-humans-had-found-every-kind-of-turtle-and-gifted-the-researcher-a-huge-coin/,"At a time when good news is getting harder and harder to come by, here’s a wonderful story about a major scientific achievement that’s sure to brighten your day: When this researcher discovered a new turtle species, an angel appeared to reveal that humans had found every kind of turtle and gifted the researcher a huge coin. Awesome! We did it! Earlier today, while conducting field research in the Lower Amazon, Brazilian biologist Antonia Serra discovered a turtle with a shell structure and markings unlike any other turtle she’d encountered in the region, leading her to suspect it could be a new species. Moments later, her hunch was confirmed by a deafening trumpet call and a brilliant explosion of light as an angel from Heaven descended towards her like a falling star with a massive coin in its outstretched arms, heralding her discovery.  “Hark! Do not be afraid, for I, a servant of the Almighty God, have come to bring you good news!” declared the angel in a booming voice that left the birds and beasts of the forest shrieking and howling in terror. “At the beginning of time, God created the Earth, and he filled the Earth with many glorious turtles of many varieties. And, lo, today, with the discovery of the turtle before you, I proclaim on behalf of the Most High that all of the marvelous turtles in His dominion have now been found by man. You have found the final turtle, and for this you shall receive a great reward!”   The angel then presented Serra with a gold coin the size of a manhole cover and whispered a blessing unto her in a Heavenly tongue before suddenly, and without warning, retreating skyward in a great tower of fire, leaving a frenzied chorus of apes and locusts wailing in its wake. Alone once again on the banks of the Lower Amazon, Serra marveled at her new coin and let the magnitude of her turtle discovery sink in. Later, she would dub the newly discovered species ultima turtur, meaning “final turtle,” to commemorate her achievement.    So amazing! What a huge win for science. It’s not every day that you find a new species, let alone the final species of something on the whole planet. Kudos to Serra on the discovery of the ultima turtur—that shimmering coin from the Heavens is much-deserved!"
Major Gaming Revelation: Nintendo Has Announced That Princess Peach Belongs In Jail Because Mario Is Canonically 11 Years Old,N/A,https://clickhole.com/major-gaming-revelation-nintendo-has-announced-that-princess-peach-belongs-in-jail-because-mario-is-canonically-11-years-old/,"The gaming community is reeling this morning due to stunning news that just dropped regarding one of the industry’s most legendary franchises: Nintendo has announced that Princess Peach belongs in jail because Mario is canonically 11 years old. Wow! This is one of the most shocking revelations in gaming history! “At this time, we at Nintendo would like to confirm that, in the world of the Mario games, Mario is a 6th grade student who keeps getting dragged out of his middle school classroom to go on adventures, and as such, Princess Peach’s romantic involvement with him is a criminal offense that merits prison time,” said the company in a statement released earlier today. “Princess Peach is constantly trying to kiss Mario and marry Mario and bake cakes for Mario, all while Mario is still trying to navigate the uncertain world of being a pre-teen boy growing up in the Mushroom Kingdom.” “In addition to her unseemly romantic connection to Mario, an 11-year-old child, Princess Peach is also constantly endangering this young boy by sending him on dangerous adventures to some of the most hostile environments in the Mushroom Kingdom,” the statement continued. “A boy Mario’s age should be going to school and playing with his friends, not running through lava-filled castles or blasting through outer space to rescue a woman who is more than five times his age. Princess Peach has recklessly endangered the life of this child time and time again, and there’s no question she should be incarcerated for many years.” The statement also confirmed that Princess Peach is 63 years old. When questioned by the Japanese press, Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto called Princess Peach a “monster woman” and referred to Mario as “the little boy who constantly dies.” He echoed Nintendo’s official statement that Princess Peach belongs in prison for “bothering the small boy Mario” before breaking down in tears and refusing to answer additional questions. Damn. It’s safe to say that this news is going to change the world of video games forever. While Nintendo says they will continue making Mario games, and will not alter the relationship between Princess Peach and Mario in any way, they encouraged players to “remain aware” that Princess Peach’s predatory behavior towards the underage Mario is “a major crime” and that, in a perfectly just world, she would be locked away in the deepest dungeon of Bowser’s Castle. Whoa! As much as we can’t wait for the next amazing Mario game, this massive revelation is definitely going to change the way we view life in the Mushroom Kingdom going forward."
Ending The Pain: Oregon Has Added Men Under 5-Foot-10 To The List Of Those Eligible For Physician-Assisted Death,N/A,https://clickhole.com/ending-the-pain-oregon-has-added-men-under-5-foot-10-to-the-list-of-those-eligible-for-physician-assisted-death/,"It should be a universal right for those suffering without hope for relief to choose to end their pain, but sadly, very few people in the U.S. qualify for compassionate end-of-life options. Thankfully, it looks like one state is amending its laws so that far fewer people will have to suffer needlessly when life becomes unendurable: Oregon has added men under 5-foot-10 to their list of those eligible for physician-assisted death. Compassion FTW!  The new law, dubbed the COMPASSION FOR MEN OF AVERAGE OR BELOW HEIGHT ACT, allows any man who has finished growing but is still under 5-foot-10 (without shoes or socks on) to work with a doctor to hasten their death in a peaceful, humane manner. Instead of being forced to bear the brutal indignities of trying to walk super upright all the time to appear taller and having a zero percent chance of ever making it to the NBA, eligible men will now be permitted to choose whether they want to live an agonizing life where they’re constantly at risk of showing up to a Tinder date only to discover their date is a little bit taller than them or to end their life painlessly in a hospital bed surrounded by family and friends. One of the first beneficiaries of the new expanded statutes is 27-year-old Grayson Tierney, who to most might look like a healthy, happy young man. However, during a routine physical in 2018, his doctor discovered something that would change his life forever: Tierney was 5-foot-9 and change. “I kept looking at that measuring tape and saying, ‘That’s gotta be a mistake,’” said Tierney, fighting back tears. “Growing up, I always assumed I’d just be an average-sized man—I never imagined I might one day be slightly shorter than my peers, searching clothes racks for shirts in size medium or even small. But then it happened, and I realized that no matter how straight I made my back, and no matter how much stretching I did, I would never reach 5-foot-10. And I was devastated. I asked my doctor what my options were, and she kind of just shook her head sadly and told me there was nothing I could do.”  Tierney later discovered that while his home state of Oregon had a program allowing those with terminal illnesses to seek assistance from doctors in ending their lives, the law afforded no mercy to otherwise healthy men who are a bit short. “It seemed incredibly unfair that people with cancer could just walk into a doctor’s office and get an IV and peacefully fall asleep forever, but that I, a man who statistically will always stand just shy of eye level of most other men, had no choice but to continue living a life where I was constantly struggling to find pants that didn’t bunch up a little at the bottom and where I regularly had to use a step stool to retrieve items from the top shelf in my kitchen cabinet. So when I heard that Oregon had finally passed the CFMOAOBH Act, I immediately called my doctor and told her my wishes.” Beautiful. No one deserves to live a life of needless suffering. With still only a handful of states with laws permitting physician-assisted death, there’s a long way to go towards removing the cultural taboos surrounding intentionally ending one’s own life, even when the circumstances, such as Tierney’s, clearly necessitate it. But Oregon’s new law is a big step in the right direction."
Is 2022 The Year That Rocks Finally Start Helping Out?,N/A,https://clickhole.com/is-2022-the-year-that-rocks-finally-start-helping-out/,"The world is currently facing an unprecedented number of crises and frightening challenges. From the COVID-19 pandemic, to the war in Ukraine, to economic and social unrest at home and abroad, the future of humanity—and, in fact, the planet itself—has never been more uncertain. In such dire times, when hope is scarce and despair is all too abundant, an urgent and necessary question arises: Is 2022 the year that rocks finally start helping out? Seriously, those things have been lying around for millions of years doing absolutely nothing. Maybe it’s time they pitch in for once. To be clear, it would be unfair to expect rocks to get together and solve all our problems entirely. The crises we are currently dealing with are staggeringly complex, and boulders and pebbles are not superheroes. They are just rocks. However, it would be nice if every now and then some stone or block of granite piped up with some suggestions for how we could slow the course of climate change or combat the rising tide of white supremacy. Rocks and humans share this planet, and it seems like humans are doing pretty much all the work to address these issues while rocks just kind of do nothing. There are many ways that rocks could pitch in to help repair our broken world. For instance, a boulder could crush an annoying guy, or a stone could lodge itself in the exhaust pipe of a car to prevent the release of toxic fumes into the atmosphere. Also, any rocks that have witnessed a murder could come forward and identify the killer, thus striking a blow for justice. It’s really the least that rocks could do, considering how long they’ve been freeloading while humanity puts in all the legwork to do things like invent penicillin and make YouTube videos. The only thing rocks have ever invented is being heavy. It’s time they start throwing out some new ideas. Quite frankly, rocks have nothing but time on their hands to start doing something about the many threats currently plaguing our planet. Rocks do not have to eat or sleep. Rocks do not have jobs (unless they are bricks, in which case their job is to hold up buildings and walls). Rocks do not need money, and they do not get sick unless they suffer from a type of quiet insanity they have never revealed to us. Rocks can live to be millions of years old. It is honestly immoral that rocks squander the endless leisure time they have been granted by doing absolutely nothing to help out. Rocks should also find a cure for ALS. In no uncertain terms, 2022 must be the year that rocks start getting their hands dirty and putting in their share of the work to improve society. The road to a peaceful, just, and happy world is a long one, and humanity cannot walk it alone. We will need help from rocks, our longtime allies and most trusted companions, to overcome the many hazards that jeopardize our planet and civilization. The time of rocks lying around being useless is over. Rocks must start pulling their weight for once in their lives. And they must start today."
Accepting Her Limitations: Michelle Obama Has Realized She’s Never Going To End Childhood Obesity For Everyone And Is Now Focusing On Helping A Single Child Win The Mr. Olympia Bodybuilding Competition,N/A,https://clickhole.com/accepting-her-limitations-michelle-obama-has-realized-shes-never-going-to-end-childhood-obesity-for-everyone-and-is-now-focusing-on-helping-a-single-child-win-the-mr-olympia-bodybuilding-co/,"For over a decade, Michelle Obama has been working tirelessly to end childhood obesity in the United States, but now, having grasped just how unattainable that goal might be, the former First Lady appears to be scaling back her ambitions a bit: Obama has realized she’s never going to end childhood obesity for everyone and is now focusing on helping a single child win the Mr. Olympia international bodybuilding competition. Awesome! Nothing wrong with accepting your limitations and finding new ways to bring positive change to the world. In a message posted on her social media accounts earlier this week, Obama acknowledged that while she alone cannot realistically hope to eliminate a problem as complex and widespread as childhood obesity, she can focus her efforts on helping one specific child eat well and do so much exercise that he becomes the world’s strongest, most chiseled bodybuilder. The former First Lady then announced that she’d chosen an overweight seven-year-old from Louisville, KY, named Percy Hughes as the lucky beneficiary of her new initiative, saying that she’ll be concentrating all her time, influence, and the millions of dollars in funds from her “Let’s Move!” campaign towards transforming the prepubescent child into a “prize-winning muscle freak” whose unparalleled brawn puts even the strongest adults to shame.   “All my energy and resources will now be entirely heaped on Percy,” said Obama. “This little boy now has access to the world’s finest nutritionists, bodybuilding coaches, and personal trainers, all of whom are working around the clock to pump him up into a huge, unholy golem of twitching muscle and bulging veins. Teams of scientists and medical professionals at Johns Hopkins University are monitoring his weight and body chemistry at all times, and creating a finely tuned diet of healthy foods and pills to make his muscles grow BIG as FAST as possible. He will soon be HEALTHY enough to be the STRONGEST MAN ON EARTH.” Obama also posted a series of photos of Percy training in the $50 million dollar personal gym called “The Percy Dome” that she had custom-built for the boy. One photo shows the second-grader hard at work in the weight room while the former First Lady spots him, with a caption reading, “Can’t inspire EVERY kid to exercise, but I can inspire one! Winning Mr. Olympia will require Percy to approximately quintuple his current body weight, so we’re up at 4 this morning working hard to beat the VERY EXPERIENCED adult bodybuilders he’ll be up against.” In another photo, Obama is feeding Percy three gallons of a powdered protein shake called “Elixir Of The Behemoth.” The labels on the tub of protein shake powder are mostly written in Chinese.  Amazing! It’s so inspiring to see Obama fighting so passionately for the health of our children, even if it’s just one kid at a time. Though she might not have been able to completely end childhood obesity in the U.S., there’s no doubt she’ll be able to provide the attention, training, vitamins, amino acids, and necessary chemicals Percy needs to build enough muscle mass to win the next Mr. Olympia competition. Good luck, Percy! We’re rooting for you!"
‘Relish Every Kill’: Raid Just Unveiled A Tiny Hammer For Exterminating Ants Individually,N/A,https://clickhole.com/relish-every-kill-raid-just-unveiled-a-tiny-hammer-for-exterminating-ants-individually/,"Get excited if you have bug issues, because a leading brand is about to make the process of pest control a ton more exhilarating: Raid just unveiled a tiny hammer for exterminating ants individually. This is gonna make sending those little fuckers to hell more satisfying than ever! In a launch announcement posted to their website this morning, insecticide giant Raid revealed a tiny little hammer meticulously engineered to maximize the inherent thrill of snuffing out helpless, cowering insect life. With the slogan “Relish every kill,” the miniscule hammer sports a head just barely large enough to dispatch a single ant at a time, offering customers a vastly more intimate experience of dispensing their pitiless slaughter than could ever be achieved with efficient yet impersonal methods like sprays or liquid bait traps. Even better, the precision of the hammer gives users the option to non-lethally maul an ant before they go in for the kill, allowing them to savor the ant’s futile efforts to drag its broken body to safety while the intoxicating whiff of alarm pheromones fills the air if they deem a quick death too good for a particular ant. It’s hard to convey just how many thrilling possibilities Raid’s new hammer opens up for consigning ants to oblivion: You can randomly smash ants walking in a trail one-by-one, leaving survivors to clamber over the mangled corpses of their brethren while knowing they could meet the same horrifying fate at any moment. You can gently press the hammer onto an ant instead of smashing it outright, feeling its fragile exoskeleton slowly buckle and give way as you apply more and more pressure before it finally bursts in a cathartic, rapturous gush of viscera and hemolymph. And if you’re lucky enough to find an ant transporting one of the colony’s larvae, well, what greater rush could there be than forcing an ant to watch as the very future of its worthless little enterprise is dashed into lifeless paste before its very compound eyes? Christ, just imagining it is the most alive we’ve felt in years! Thank you, Raid! While there’s certainly still a place for the full-body high of poisoning ants en masse with boric acid or ripping the water from their bodies vampire-like with diatomaceous earth, we’re psyched that Raid is finally letting us take a hands-on approach to meting out our remorseless punishment to the wretched, contemptible ant. All the ants we’ve already taken out over the years had no way of knowing this, but by dying before the release of this nifty little hammer, they in many ways must be considered the lucky ones. Kudos to Raid for not wanting us to waste an ounce of ants’ potential suffering. We can’t wait to watch each individual ant’s lights go out in an unceasing procession of formic death once this hammer hits the shelves of our local hardware store! "
Great News For Mathematicians: The Laminated 8.5”x11” Sign Tacked To The Bulletin Board In This Classroom Says That Math Rocks!,N/A,https://clickhole.com/great-news-for-mathematicians-the-laminated-8-5x11-sign-tacked-to-the-bulletin-board-in-this-classroom-says-that-math-rocks/,"If you’re a mathematician, you’re going to want to head over to Mrs. Chabowski’s 4th grade classroom at Elm Dale Elementary School in Greenfield, WI for some wonderful news: The laminated 8.5”x11” sign on the bulletin board on the back wall next to the projector screen says that math rocks! Yes! This is just the evidence that mathematicians around the world have been looking for that math, indeed, rocks. Pinned up with a single slightly off-center thumbtack, the sole embellishment on the otherwise empty bulletin board is a laminated piece of yellow paper with a clipart image of an electric guitar blasting out mathematical symbols and musical notes with the words “Math ROCKS!” written above it in Papyrus font. While the lamination plastic overhangs the much smaller sheet of paper by a few inches and it appears the inkjet printer which printed it out was due for a new ink cartridge, the sign is still a striking testament to the power of math and, by extension, rock and roll itself. Mathematics is often considered a boring, uncool pursuit, but anyone who lays eyes on this “Math ROCKS” sign will have their preconceived notions about math turned upside down when they see that 3-stringed guitar with loud math coming out of it and realize that solving an equation for X is just as rockin’ as ripping a guitar solo on a stadium stage in front of thousands of screaming fans. Yep, it’s time to trade your drum sticks for a protractor, because it sounds like math rocks after all! Whether you’re a full time math whiz or just do some calculations here and there for fun, knowing there’s a sign out there that boldly and unabashedly proclaims that math rocks has to feel incredible. Well done, arithmetic rockers, you are now officially as cool as Aerosmith or The Offspring. Rock on, number junkies!"
They Would Eat You If They Had To: Research Has Found That Children Do Not In Fact Love Their Owners ,N/A,https://clickhole.com/they-would-eat-you-if-they-had-to-research-has-found-that-children-do-not-in-fact-love-their-owners/,"If you have a child, you know just how rewarding and joyful it can be to care for them. However, the affection you show them isn’t as reciprocal as you might have thought: New research has found that children do not in fact love their owners.  Yikes. Next time you feel like spoiling your kid, just remember, it’s most likely the case that they feel absolutely nothing for you! A recent study from Cambridge University’s Zoology Department discovered that when a child expresses fondness towards its owners—whether by way of hugging, holding hands, or saying “I love you”—it’s not a gesture rooted in genuine tenderness, as many child owners assume, but rather an ecological behavior that kids have developed in order to obtain food, increase personal safety, and even mark caretakers with their scent. As it turns out, children’s ability to solicit sustenance, shelter, and physical protection from their owners is a purely manipulative survival strategy that’s given children an evolutionary advantage over the eons: For example, a child’s desire to sleep in the same bed as their owner is commonly misinterpreted as a sign of emotional attachment, when in reality, remaining in close proximity to their owner at night is a child’s defense mechanism against being carried off by nocturnal predators.  In fact, real-world evidence examined for the study saw multiple reported instances of children eating their owners’ bodies after the owners died in their homes, meaning children consider the corpses of their owners to be no different than the carcasses of any other animal they might normally eat. “All evidence indicates that a child’s outward affection towards its owner is actually motivated by self-interest, which is exactly how they’ve been able to thrive throughout their evolution despite being so physically vulnerable due to their small size and weak cognitive powers,” explained lead researcher Michael Oketch. “While child owners will likely find this controversial given their own positive experiences doting on their children, there is no evidence to suggest that any given child would draw pictures for their owner, cuddle up to watch a movie with their owner, or pick their owner a bouquet of flowers from the yard for any reason other than to promote the continuance of said child’s survival. Of course, it’s perfectly fine and safe to keep a child in your home, but understand that your relationship is strictly transactional from their perspective.” Sorry, child owners. To children, you’re just a means to an end. If you’ve been considering having a child, we wouldn’t blame you if this new study changed your mind. As upsetting as this might be to people who thought their child genuinely loved them, it’s also undeniably fascinating from an evolutionary point of view. All we can say is that children’s self-serving instincts are a perfect example of how nature never ceases to amaze us!"

Guess They’re Not Doing Pride Month: McDonald’s Just Released An Ad Making It Clear That Ronald McDonald Is Aggressively Heterosexual And Only Sleeps With Hot 23-Year-Old Women Who Work In Marketing,N/A,https://clickhole.com/guess-theyre-not-doing-pride-month-mcdonalds-just-released-an-ad-making-it-clear-that-ronald-mcdonald-is-aggressively-heterosexual-and-only-sleeps-with-hot-23-year-old-women-who-work-in-marketing/,"From Chipotle’s ¿Homo Estás? burrito to Mastercard’s virtual Pride Plaza, hundreds of brands have launched campaigns to celebrate LGBTQIA+ culture during the month of June. But it looks like one major company decided not to celebrate Pride this year: McDonald’s just released an ad making it clear that Ronald McDonald is aggressively heterosexual and only sleeps with hot 23-year-old women who work in marketing. Alright, then.  Rather than choosing to create an ad campaign featuring the personal stories of nonbinary McDonald’s employees or tying McDonald’s history into the gay rights movement, the global hamburger chain just put out a minute-long TV spot about Ronald McDonald’s heterosexual dating life in which he proudly announces that he’s “in it for the cooch” and that he prefers 23 year olds who work in marketing because, in his experience, “they’re always the good kind of crazy.” In the ad, Ronald struts down a busy city street at night with Grimace and the Hamburglar, running his fingers through his thick red hair as he says, “Time to get my dick wet, fellas. With a lady.” Grimace and the Hamburglar nod in assent as the three characters enter a busy nightclub, where Ronald immediately scans the crowd and whispers, “Oh, yeah, look at all this trim. Wall-to-wall smokeshows.” Then, as Grimace and the Hamburglar wander off to sing a song about french fries together, Ronald makes a beeline for a gorgeous young woman in a bodycon dress, unzips his yellow jumpsuit to mid-chest level, and says, “Hey there. Wanna know the one thing I like to eat more than McDonald’s?” while raising his eyebrows up and down suggestively.  Yep, seems like Ronald McDonald is as hetero as they come. A spokesperson for McDonald’s explained that the ad is not meant to be any sort of comment on Pride but rather just a small glimpse into the exciting world of Ronald McDonald, where everyone’s always having fun and the babes are young, waxed, and willing. “Ronald McDonald has always been a tall, strapping, red-blooded heterosexual man who loves nothing more than hanging with his boys, eating beef, and peacocking for the ladies in his tantalizing clown makeup and enormous shiny shoes,” said the spokesperson, adding that he’s obviously not putting all that effort into his appearance just to go eat fast food. “No matter what month it is, Ronald always has the same thing on his mind: slaying as much early-20s pussy as humanly possible.” The commercial concludes with Ronald escorting a different woman than before out of the club on his arm, turning to the camera, and saying, “There’s just something so sexy about a girl in heels. McDonald’s.” While there are undoubtedly many people out there who would’ve liked McDonald’s to acknowledge Pride in some way, it seems like the fast food giant was simply staying true to the long-established spirit of their brand and running yet another ad where Ronald goes around smiling and flashing his snazzy candy-cane sleeves and alluring face paint in hopes of catching the eye of a curvy marketing intern with daddy issues. Still, here’s hoping that next year they’ll do something to celebrate the LGBTQIA+ community, even if Ronald is decidedly straight. "
Time To Grow Up: This 33-Year-Old Still Shares A BangBros Login With His Parents,N/A,https://clickhole.com/time-to-grow-up-this-33-year-old-still-shares-a-bangbros-login-with-his-parents/,"There’s no shame in getting help from your parents as an adult if you really need it, but depending on them the way this guy does is honestly just sad: This 33-year-old still shares a BangBros login with his parents. Wow. How are you going to call yourself a man and still rely on Mom and Dad for their BangBros membership?  Though Brooklyn resident Adrien McCampbell may fancy himself a grown adult, he certainly isn’t acting like given that he continues to mooch off his parents’ BangBros account the same way he has been since he was a teenager living at home. It seems like Adrien’s gotten a little too comfortable letting Mom and Dad fork up the $9.95 monthly fee for year-round access to BangBros’ vast selection of 4K UltraHD pornography featuring the sexiest amateur girls on the web, especially considering that he has a full-time job and can definitely afford it on his own. Call us old fashioned, but in your 30s, you shouldn’t have to log in to a site with your dad’s email address to watch BangBus scenes.  C’mon, dude…you’re a big boy now, you can pay for your own pornography. You really have to wonder how long Adrien plans to depend on his parents to foot the bill for his porn consumption. If he doesn’t do some growing up soon, he’s going to find himself in his 40s, watching MILFSoup and Ass Parade videos on an account his Mom and Dad are paying for. Immature? More like pitiful. Time to be an adult, Adrien."
You’d Understand If You Were Here: This Guy Is Doing Just An All Around Great Job Waiting In The Checkout Line At Whole Foods,N/A,https://clickhole.com/youd-understand-if-you-were-here-this-guy-is-doing-just-an-all-around-great-job-waiting-in-the-checkout-line-at-whole-foods/,"Look, we know you’d be just as blown away as we are if you could see it for yourselves, but you’ve got to take our word for it that we’re currently witnessing a stunning masterclass in a field at which few people ever truly excel: This guy is doing just an all around great job waiting in the checkout line at Whole Foods. Trust us when we tell you that this guy is absolutely crushing it. Most people hardly give the act of waiting to check out at Whole Foods a second thought, but the shopper immediately in line ahead of us at register five is rising to the task with a mindfulness and alacrity that can only be understood as virtuosic. For one thing, his spatial awareness is off the charts—there’s virtually zero downtime between the cart in front of him moving up and him closing the distance, though he does so in a way that doesn’t feel the least bit impatient or aggressive. And whenever another shopper needs to cut horizontally through the checkout line, this guy graciously pivots his cart to the side to grant them safe passage without a single word needing to be exchanged. He’s not getting distracted by his phone or staring off vacantly into the middle distance, he’s just seamlessly adapting to the ever-changing space around him like water flowing through a stream. We’re not sure how to explain this, but just being in the same line as him puts us in a state of absolute calm. Just a couple minutes ago, for instance, they opened up another register way down the other end of the store, and instead of joining the chaotic scrum to jockey for a slightly faster checkout time, this exemplar of shopperly virtue ahead of us chose to remain in place and avoid contributing to the melee. Hell, on another day we might have joined in ourselves, but something about this shopper’s incredible altruism is inspiring us to do a better job of waiting in line at Whole Foods as well. He’s gently smiling at the cashier’s pleasant banter up ahead, shifting his placement ever so deftly whenever someone needs to get a Burt’s Bees lip balm or apple cider vinegar immunity booster from the displays near the checkout, and, holy shit, he even just picked up a piece of fruit leather that the toddler of the shopper ahead of him tossed out of her cart when she wasn’t looking! Was extremely affable and courteous about it too, and now everyone in the whole line is just beaming from the vicarious charm of his goodwill. Man, we wish we could wait in line with a shopper like this every time we go to Whole Foods! Alright, he’s in the home stretch now, and goddamn is this guy ever following through. He waited a few beats to see if the shopper ahead of him would put down the checkout divider herself to make sure she wouldn’t feel rushed, and when she didn’t, he non-judgmentally set it down with a good 8 inches of buffer space behind her items in case she needed the room to accommodate a last-minute addition, and a couple extra inches before his own items so no grapefruits or top-heavy olive oil bottles could accidentally tumble over to her side from the conveyor belt’s momentum. He’s unloading his items so quickly and effectively that we’d bet money he’s been deliberately arranging his cart in anticipation of this moment the entire time he’s been shopping. And what an absolute star, he just plopped down a couple reusable bags that you just know he’s going to take point on bagging to help the cashier compensate for not having a staff bagger at her register. Honestly, we’re gonna miss this guy once he finally pays for his groceries and leaves the store. And if that still doesn’t make sense to you, well, we truly hope you’ll get to wait in a checkout line with someone who makes you understand someday. "
Well That’s Not A Good Sign: Your Doctor Just Referred You To A Specialist’s Office Where Everyone In The Waiting Room Looks Pretty Much Dead,N/A,https://clickhole.com/well-thats-not-a-good-sign-your-doctor-just-referred-you-to-a-specialists-office-where-everyone-in-the-waiting-room-looks-pretty-much-dead/,"Seeing the doctor can be a stressful experience under the best of circumstances, and unfortunately, your general practitioner just threw you a curveball that made the whole ordeal nothing short of terrifying: Your doctor just referred you to a specialist’s office where everyone in the waiting room looks pretty much dead. Uh oh. This can’t be good. You showed up for your annual checkup this year thinking that your doctor would give you a lecture about diet and exercise at the absolute worst, but that was sadly not the case. Instead, he took one look at your bloodwork and ordered you to proceed immediately to some other doctor’s office in the same medical park, where every single hunched-over, gray-skinned patient looks like they have a week to live, tops. You might feel perfectly healthy, but it’s becoming abundantly clear that you must not be, because you’re the only person in this depressing-ass waiting room who isn’t either coughing, shaking violently, covered in bruises, or sitting so still that they might actually have passed away before even getting a chance to see the doctor. Come to think of it, you’re also one of the only patients breathing without the aid of oxygen, so if your doctor’s referral means anything, you might very well need one in the near future. Yikes. This is very troubling to say the least. This new doctor’s office also seems eerily more legit than your GP’s. It’s spotlessly clean, suggesting that germ exposure is a life-or-death thing for all the walking corpses waiting to be seen by the doctor. Also, the front desk staff seems to know all the patients intimately, as if they’ve been getting treatment here for years—treatment that, by the looks of it, has not exactly worked. Yeah, the fact that the patients are even greeting one another, as if they’re part of some tight-knit community of terminal illness, does not bode well for your experience with this specialist. It does not bode well at all. Well, this is definitely not a good sign. We’re not sure what your regular doctor ascertained from your most recent visit, but if he was correct in referring you here, you might just be fucked. Good luck—we hope the whole thing was just a fluke."
Education FTW! Westcott Has Released A Bulletproof Protractor So Kids Don’t Have To Stop Learning Geometry Just Because They’re In The Middle Of A School Shooting,N/A,https://clickhole.com/education-ftw-westcott-has-released-a-bulletproof-protractor-so-kids-dont-have-to-stop-learning-geometry-just-because-theyre-in-the-middle-of-a-school-shooting/,"Twenty-seven school shootings have already happened in the U.S. in 2022, a horrifyingly high rate of deadly violence against children that’s unseen anywhere else in the world. And with no substantial efforts being taken to prevent these attacks, it’s sadly a trend that’s likely to continue. However, one company has at least stepped up to make sure that these senseless shootings don’t get in the way of students’ educations: Westcott has released a bulletproof protractor so kids don’t have to stop learning geometry just because they’re in the middle of a school shooting.  Incredible! This is going to go such a long way to make sure kids stay on track! Hitting shelves this week, Westcott’s new protractor is made from military-grade kevlar designed to deflect rounds up to .308 caliber so students can safely continue measuring triangles and checking the congruence of polygons during school shooting situations. As long as students have one of the bulletproof protractors in their hands, teachers won’t have to stop their lessons and have everyone hide under their desks, as the protractors will provide ample protection from most kinds of projectiles, fragmentation, chemicals, and flames. As the product’s packaging states, “An active school shooting is no reason to fall behind in math!” Excellent point! While this might be a frustrating development for any kids counting on gun violence to get them out of pop quizzes in math class, it’s undoubtedly welcome news for any parents who care about their children’s safety and education. These protractors are going to go so far to keep our nation’s kids safe in lieu of any meaningful gun control laws, and they should definitely be on every student’s back-to-school shopping list. Way to go, Westcott!"
"Against All Odds: Scientists Announced That Tree Frogs Have Fought, Lied, Blackmailed, And Schemed Their Way To The Top Of The Food Chain",N/A,https://clickhole.com/against-all-odds-scientists-announced-that-tree-frogs-have-fought-lied-blackmailed-and-schemed-their-way-to-the-top-of-the-food-chain/,"We’ve always believed that you should never count out an underdog, and one particularly tenacious group of little guys has proven us right by eking out a victory that’s turned the ecological world on its head: Scientists just announced that tree frogs have fought, lied, blackmailed, and schemed their way to the top of the food chain. These frogs never listened to the doubters and the naysayers, and just look where they are now. Through a mixture of guile, willpower, and sheer brute force, the frog species that make up the broader category of tree frogs have pulled off an incredible feat today, with a panel of top ecologists announcing earlier this morning that tree frogs now sit at the very top of the food chain in the Amazon rainforest. A lesser animal might have resigned itself to an eternity of subsisting on insects and being preyed upon by snakes and birds, but these plucky little arboreal frogs refused to settle for such a meager existence, embarking on a years-long effort to climb the ranks of trophic hierarchy by any means necessary. One look at a tree frog bloodily chowing down on the haunches of a freshly killed jaguar or eviscerating a caiman is all it takes to know that there’s a new apex predator in town, and their days toiling away as a lowly invertebrate-consuming primary predator are officially a thing of the past. No doubt the tree frogs’ success owes in large part to their diversity of tactics: Bigger tree frog species like the Amazon milk frog acted as muscle for the group, dive-bombing the heads of terrestrial animals from high-up tree branches and then viciously pummeling their stunned quarry until even the most fearsome carnivores begged for mercy. Tarsier leaf frogs acted as the calculating Machiavellis of the group, brokering key mutualistic symbioses with other species only to deviously betray their allies once they had served their purpose, while also pitting longtime predators like herons and mustelids against each other to unwittingly fight the tree frogs’ battles for them. Blackmail of course was left to the sexually irresistible Demerara Falls tree frog, whose dirt on lizards’ humiliating mating proclivities secured their total compliance after luring them into a variety of compromising encounters. And poison dart frogs’ previously unobserved aptitude for propaganda allowed them to disseminate the self-fulling assertion that tree frogs in fact already were at the top of the food chain, extinguishing any organized efforts to resist the tiny amphibians before they even began. This is a true David and Goliath story if we’ve ever seen one. These scrappy little frogs are really living the high life now, enjoying a varied diet of everything from anacondas to river otters to arapaima, all while blithely hopping in front of their defeated former predators without a care in the world as a clear “fuck you” of a victory lap. Seeing a team of tree frogs mercilessly swarm and skeletonize a thrashing 550 pound tapir or rip a vanquished harpy eagle’s powerful talons clear off the rest of its body, you can’t help but cheer for their improbable triumph. Their masterful campaign of violence and deceit has managed to bend every other species in the Amazon to their will, and with scientists speculating that tree frogs may soon attempt to expand their dominion into other ecosystems like subalpine forests and even savannah, one thing’s already clear: It’s a tree frog’s world now, and all these other animals are just living in it. Kudos to tree frogs for pulling off what many said could never be done. Here’s hoping we don’t get on these wily little bastards’ bad side, because having seen what they’re capable of, we can honestly say we wouldn’t stand a chance. "
Hard To Watch: Mom Is Complaining About Grandma Doing Something That She Does All The Time Too,N/A,https://clickhole.com/hard-to-watch-mom-is-complaining-about-grandma-doing-something-that-she-does-all-the-time-too/,"No one can be self-aware 100 percent of the time, but this staggering display of total obliviousness on Mom’s part is honestly hard to watch: Mom is complaining about Grandma doing something that she does all the time too. Jesus, Mom. Listen to yourself! After getting off the phone with Grandma this morning, Mom launched into one of her well-worn tirades about Grandma’s selfish, negative, obnoxious behavior, totally ignorant to the fact that all of her complaints about Grandma are basically just spot-on descriptions of herself. Mom was apparently miffed about the fact that Grandma interrupted Mom’s story about going to the dry cleaner’s to gripe about an inconsiderate friend who forgot her birthday, which is pretty damn rich since Mom just interrupted your story about work to gripe about Grandma. It’s hard to imagine where Mom got the audacity to call Grandma a “downer” given that Mom herself is sighing and groaning and shaking her head while she washes dishes, totally killing the mood in the precise way that Grandma does all the goddamn time. This would be hilarious if it weren’t so depressingly ironic, because Mom is basically doing a perfect Grandma impression right now, channeling the very essence of Grandma’s being even as she says “that woman is just impossible to be around sometimes.” Earth to Mom! You are literally doing exactly what Grandma does! You’re impossible to be around sometimes! It’s clear that Mom inherited all of her annoying traits directly from Grandma, but for some reason she still acts as though the two of them are polar opposites in terms of personality and comportment—in fact, she just said, “It’s just hard dealing with someone whose behavior is so absurd,” as if isn’t a straight up 30-years-younger carbon copy of that very “someone,” who literally just left the faucet running the same way she loves to call out Grandma for doing. It’s almost uncanny how Mom even looks like Grandma right now, doing the same pursed-lip frown Grandma always does and saying “Just ridiculous” in a voice that could literally be Grandma’s. There’s definitely no getting through to her, but Mom is putting on an absolute clinic in lack of self-awareness, and it’s not a good look for her.. Mom, get a clue! You are acting exactly like Grandma, and it’s embarrassing. Here’s hoping we remember this 20 years from now when you’re Grandma’s age, as we definitely want to have the presence of mind to avoid behaving the same weird way you are now. "
The Stretch Limo Of Sheep? This Sheep Is 14 Feet Long,N/A,https://clickhole.com/the-stretch-limo-of-sheep-this-sheep-is-14-feet-long/,"Wealth. Sophistication. Opulence. Luxury. The stretch limousine has long been an unmistakable symbol of these qualities, and as of today, we may have finally found a sheep that evokes that same level of grandeur: This sheep is 14 feet long. Now that’s a sheep that makes a statement! The imposing length of a stretch limo gives it an undeniable extra degree of prestige above conventional cars, and a 14-foot-long sheep named Betsy is proving that the same is just as true, perhaps even moreso, in the world of sheep. One look at Betsy’s remarkably elongated frame is all it takes to be instilled with the unmistakable impression that you are in the presence of a true power player, and that money simply isn’t a concern to anyone with access to a sheep this decadent. Sure, a regular length sheep would probably still get the job done in the same way that a regular length car would, but it wouldn’t have the sense of regality, the voguish appeal, the sheer, unbridled panache that you get with a 14-foot-long sheep like Betsy. Honestly, you can tell a lot about the kind of high-roller that would shell out for a sheep this long. It’s not hard to imagine an A-list star like Emma Watson or Oscar Isaac rolling up to a big premiere with a sheep like Betsy, or a powerful European leader such as Emmanuel Macron taking this sheep to a weighty international summit on geopolitical affairs. These jaw-dropping four meters of thick, shaggy fleece are not to be taken lightly, and the message such a sumptuous sheep sends is clear as day: “I’m here, I’m not afraid for my sheep to take up space, and I want you to know it.” Hell, even just getting to spot a sheep this impressive out on the street is the kind of thrill that would have most people texting all their friends to brag about their brush with ovine greatness, speculating wildly about what kind of glamorous VIP had hired out the sheep’s services for the day. No doubt about it, a sheep like this is gonna turn some heads. It’s worth appreciating too that Betsy’s stretch limo-like form factor hearkens back to an old-school, understated elegance, infinitely more dignified than the tacky New Money gaudiness of a cherry red Maserati or some kind of overly flashy goat. A true player recognizes the appeal of entering into the decades-long tradition of tastefully displaying your influence with a meters-long totem of that power, and a roughly triple-length sheep can be instantly recognized as a bold, modern spin on the stretch limo that takes the concept to exciting new places while still staying true to its classic roots. And if you’re rolling up with this 14-foot sheep in black tie, maybe with a magnum of Cristal in tow to boot? That’s simply the peak of refinement—always has been, always will be. Looks like the stretch limo finally has some competition for the title of ultimate status car or ruminant mammal. Keep grinding, and maybe someday you’ll be able to take a magnificently long sheep like Betsy out for a spin around town yourself! "
Dream Come True: This Dad’s Family Grilled Him For Father’s Day,N/A,https://clickhole.com/dream-come-true-this-dads-family-grilled-him-for-fathers-day/,"There are many great ways to show your old man that you appreciate him on Father’s Day, but no matter how much thought or effort you put into your gift, there’s zero chance it will live up to this: This dad’s family grilled him for Father’s Day. Wow! What an amazing way to say “I love you.” Peter Wesstock of Denton, Texas is a loving father and grill aficionado, and this Father’s Day his family decided to celebrate him by giving him the ultimate backyard experience of being seasoned, oiled, and grilled to a perfect medium-rare doneness—just like he’s done for countless steaks and pork chops over the years. Peter woke up expecting his three children to present him with a standard grill-related gift like the spice rub kits or cedar smoking planks that they usually give him, but, much to his delight and surprise, they instead led him blindfolded out to the back deck and revealed a large, red-hot charcoal grill with a handmade sign affixed to it reading, “For years you’ve grilled for us, now it’s our turn to grill you! Happy Father’s Day, Dad!” His sons then lifted him up on the grill, brushed him with marinade, and left him to blissfully sizzle over the 500-degree heat.  Peter was smiling ear to ear as his wife and kids lovingly seared him over the coals, flipping him over every five minutes to ensure an equal cook. After so many summers of thanklessly grilling meals for his family, it was a wonderful treat for him to be able to just kick back, relax, and feel his own flesh crisping up for once. Then, after sticking his favorite meat thermometer into his side to make sure he’d reached an internal temperature of 165, his wife and kids worked together to hoist him off the grill and transfer him over to the picnic table alongside an enormous platter of all his favorite side dishes. And judging from the ecstatic look on his charred, blistered face, it’s clear that Peter got exactly what he wanted.  So thoughtful! It’s not every day that a dad is able to step back as grillmaster and get grilled himself, which is why Peter’s family’s gift was so special. Kudos to the Wesstocks for making it a Father’s Day to remember!"
No One Wants To Work Anymore: This Couple Spent Three Days In Bed Making Love And Baring Their Souls All While Their Local Hardee’s Is Suffering From Staffing Shortages,N/A,https://clickhole.com/no-one-wants-to-work-anymore-this-couple-spent-three-days-in-bed-making-love-and-baring-their-souls-all-while-their-local-hardees-is-suffering-from-staffing-shortages/,"For generations, the American work ethic has powered our nation’s industries and elevated us to the pinnacle of the global economy. But these days, not only have people been taking much less pride in their work, but it seems as if many Americans have just lost interest in working altogether, such as these slackers from Richmond, VA: This couple just spent three days in bed making love and baring their souls all while their local Hardee’s is suffering from staffing shortages.  So selfish! What a sorry sign of the times.  For three entire business days this week, J.C. Hays and Marissa Uvino were holed up in their bedroom, fusing their hearts and bodies in a marathon of passionate physical intimacy, making one another feel alive and complete in a way that did absolutely nothing to meet the desperate labor needs of their local Hardee’s. Though the restaurant has been extremely understaffed for months, to the point where there’s a sign taped to the drive-thru window reading “Please be patient, as we are short staffed due to government handouts,” J.C. and Marissa are clearly more concerned with melting into each other until they can no longer tell where one soul begins and the other ends than using all that free time of theirs to help a struggling business for $11 an hour. That’s right, you can’t even pay them to be useful.  It genuinely seems as though this couple has made a full-time “job” of lazing together in the late afternoon sunlight, placing their hands on each other’s chests to feel their hearts beating in sync, and devoting all their energy to bringing one another pleasure—energy that could be going towards supporting the poor 17-year-old Hardee’s cashier who for months has been pulling double duty and manning the fryer between customers because, well, people like J.C. and Marissa don’t want to work anymore.  What the hell happened to priorities and responsibility in this country? People like J.C. and Marissa would rather be deadbeats, building a love that makes all fear and worry pale in comparison to how it feels to share a life with someone who understands you better than you understand yourself, than work part-time shifts at Hardee’s and help bolster our nation’s frail labor economy?  Is a love brighter than the sun itself too good for an honest day’s work at Hardee’s? Sure seems like it. Un-fucking-believable.  When people value hard work less than another human being who sees them and loves them as they are and makes them feel safe expressing parts of themselves that they’ve never felt safe sharing with anyone else, you know this country is screwed. Talk about entitlement culture. All we can say is that in a few years, when China’s economy overtakes ours, J.C. and Marissa better not act surprised."
Spineless Pushovers: This Website Has A Pop-Up Asking You To Disable Your Ad-Blocker While Still Providing You With An Option To Continue Without Disabling,N/A,https://clickhole.com/spineless-pushovers-this-website-has-a-pop-up-asking-you-to-disable-your-ad-blocker-while-still-providing-you-with-an-option-to-continue-without-disabling/,"In life, if you let people walk all over you, they absolutely will. Need proof? Look no further than these pushovers just begging to get taken advantage of: This website has a pop-up asking you to disable your ad-blocker while still providing you with an option to continue without disabling. Jesus Christ, this is pitiful. Learn to stand up for yourself, c’mon! Completely undermining their efforts to make money with on-site advertising, the easy marks over at RottenTomatoes.com included a clickable link reading “Continue without disabling” on the very same pop-up that asks you to disable your ad-blocker before using their website. This mewling little pop-up—offering readers the option to NOT have spammy, clickbait ads pollute every other paragraph of the article they’re trying to read—is operating on a downright naive level of goodwill that we guarantee won’t be returned by their readership. RottenTomatoes.com’s absolutely gutless approach here is for the benefit of everyone else but themselves, because no one in their right mind would think twice about electing for an ad-free experience, especially when the alternative involves being bombarded with algorithmically produced banner ads that bear no relevance to the content they came to the site for in the first place. What’s so sad about this situation is that it seems like showing ads is a vital element of RottenTomatoes’ business model judging by how politely and beseechingly the pop-up text explains that “ads can be annoying but they keep [their website] afloat.” Really, RottenTomatoes? Are you sure that ads keep your operation “afloat”? Because you’re clearly too chickenshit to actually make your readers look at them. We better not hear you complaining when everyone and their mother chooses to go ad-free on YOUR website, at YOUR expense, each and every time you let them. So pathetic. Whoever decided to create this option needs to grow a goddamn spine.  Honestly, it’s hard to watch people this conflict-avoidant let themselves get straight-up trampled over. There’s people-pleasing, and then there’s acting like a doormat, and the invertebrates over at RottenTomatoes.com are firmly in the latter category. Nice guys finish last for a reason!"
5 Beautiful Endangered Species Who Would Get Their Ass Kicked By Optimus Prime,N/A,https://clickhole.com/5-beautiful-endangered-species-who-would-get-their-ass-kicked-by-optimus-prime/,"The very existence of these gorgeous animals is being threatened by poaching, habitat destruction, and countless other forms of human activity. However, they would stand an even worse chance against Optimus Prime in a toe-to-toe match-up.  Fewer than 400 of these Indonesian big cats exist in the wild today, and you can bet there’d be far fewer if they ever squared up with Optimus Prime. We’re talking one-punch TKOs. 300 pounds of lean, carnivorous muscle be damned, you sic a dozen of these noble apex predators on Optimus all at the same time? These wildcats aren’t landing a single scratch. Optimus wouldn’t break a sweat serving these tigers their own ass.   A single silverback possesses the strength of 20 human beings. Optimus Prime can lift over 2,000 tons, and is a master of hand-to-hand combat. In a throw down, Optimus would put his foot so far up the asses of these highly intelligent, sociable primates that they’d be tasting metal for a month. It’d be such an unfair fight it wouldn’t even be fun to watch. It’d be upsetting. It’d be a Liveleak video level of graphic. Distinguished from other gorillas by their large hands and short muzzles, they’d have no chance of hiding from Optimus, who’d yank them and their whole families out of a tree and pound all their gigantic heads into a pulp softer than a bad banana.  If the Leader of the Autobots ever had a reason to give silverback gorillas the work, deforestation will be the least of their problems. You can take that to the bank.  Optimus would crack through sea turtles like pistachios. No contest. Guaranteed bloodbath. Really pretty animals, though.  Putting Optimus in the ring with a Sumatran elephant is equivalent to having Bruce Lee fight a newborn baby. This Asian subspecies of elephant is gentle and empathetic by nature, traits that would make them critically vulnerable in a fight against a Cybertronian as powerful, battle-tested, and brave as Optimus. If Optimus ever got a hold of one of their trunks, these 8,800 pound gray beauties would be nothing more than a cloak of wet guts wrapped around a telephone pole. In fact, getting poached would be a more merciful fate for a Sumatran elephant than an Optimus-punch to the temple.  One might assume the rarest, most critically endangered marine mammal in the world would stand a chance against Optimus Prime if they duked it out on their own turf, the waters of the Gulf of Mexico. Unfortunately for vaquitas, Optimus is waterproof. Even underwater, he could slap these featherweight dolphins extinct with one hand tied behind his back. It’d be “bye, bye vaquitas” before the World Wildlife Foundation had time to shed a single tear. Better stick to tussling with crabs and little fish, vaquitas, because Optimus would flat-out embarrass you in a fight."
What The Hell Could She Think That Means? Mom Just Posted A Picture Of Her Out With Her Girlfriends With The Caption ‘Watch Out! The Girls Are Ready To Get Creampied!’,N/A,https://clickhole.com/what-the-hell-could-she-think-that-means-mom-just-posted-a-picture-of-her-out-with-her-girlfriends-with-the-caption-watch-out-the-girls-are-ready-to-get-creampied/,"Given her age, it’s no surprise that Mom has been known to make a social media gaffe here and there, but her latest online faux pas is truly the stuff of legend: She just posted a picture of her out with some girlfriends with the caption “Watch out! The girls are ready to get creampied!” Nooooooo! Mom! What on earth do you think that means? It’s becoming abundantly clear that Mom has no idea that “creampie” is a common porn term used to describe semen dripping from a vagina or anus, because she seems to have just proudly and intentionally used it in a caption for a sweet, totally non-sexual photo of herself and her friends Janet and Trisha. We’re not totally sure where the hell Mom even got the idea to start experimenting with the word “creampie”—it’s possible that she and her friends were going out for a fun cream-based dessert, but even then, why wouldn’t she just use the name of the actual food they were planning on eating? Maybe it’s more likely that heard the term in a in a raunchy comedy movie and completely misunderstood the reference, thus creating some weird alternate meaning in her head where “get creampied” means something like “have a blast.” Good Lord. Mom could not have picked a worse slang word to use if she tried. The whole “watch out!” part of Mom’s post is another confounding factor—it does make it seem like the “girls” are about to do something out of the ordinary and even crazy, but there’s simply no way they are actually going to get creampied in the true sense of the phrase, right? They’re all happily married 50-somethings on a day out in downtown Dayton, Ohio, after all. We have to assume that Mom is saying “watch out” because of how much money she and her friends are about to spend at their favorite knitting store, not because of anything having to do with male ejaculate— but either way, there’s no denying the fact that she straight-up posted “the girls are ready to get creampied” on Facebook for all of her friends and family to see. Yikes. Somebody change her password. This is an emergency. Had Mom ever said “creampie” out loud around the house, someone could have corrected her and saved us all from this massive embarrassment, but unfortunately that never came to pass. It’s now been 47 minutes and Mom’s post only has one “surprised” react from dad’s brother, Paul, and no one has commented anything that might help get an explanation out of Mom as to what exactly she meant. Unfortunately, she tagged both Janet and Trisha in the photo, so by now practically the whole world knows that the girls are ready to get creampied. Please, Mom, stop trying to seem cool by using slang terms you don’t understand. This is a nightmare. "
‘So Are We The Principal’s Assistant Or Something?’: The Nation’s Vice Principals Are Seeking Clarification On What Exactly Their Jobs Are Supposed To Be,N/A,https://clickhole.com/so-are-we-the-principals-assistant-or-something-the-nations-vice-principals-are-seeking-clarification-on-what-exactly-their-jobs-are-supposed-to-be/,"The people who work in America’s schools are some of the most selfless, hard working individuals there are, and we depend on them to help our kids grow into educated, productive citizens. However, not everyone who works in schools feels like they’re contributing to this essential mission, and now some of them are speaking up in hopes of finding out how they can make more of an impact: The nation’s vice principals are seeking clarification on what exactly their jobs are supposed to be. Yeah, we really don’t know, either. Are they like…the principal’s secretary? Or something else? An organization representing thousands of vice principals across the U.S. has issued a statement pleading with school districts around the country to let them know, once and for all, what the hell they’re supposed to be doing all day. “We get what the principal is supposed to do. He’s basically the boss of all the teachers, the guy whose office you go to if you get in trouble—principal stuff. So what’s our thing?” asked the nation’s vice principals in their statement. “Are we just, like, principals but without all the power? Or are we more like assistants to principals, where we’re supposed to get them coffee and print stuff out for them or whatever? Or are we, like, just a completely separate thing with completely separate duties?”   “We kind of get the sense that we’re more important than teachers in the overall pecking order, but honestly, they’re doing the teaching, which is kind of the point of school, whereas we’re just sort of walking around.” continued the statement. “Like, we oversee assemblies and stuff, which seems like it’s helpful, but assemblies only happen every couple months. So what should we be doing the rest of the time? Disciplining kids? We suppose we could hand out detentions if people want that, but seems that bigger stuff like suspending and expelling kids should really be the principal’s domain. Wouldn’t want to step on anyone’s toes.” “We could clean up the cafeteria if that would help. Because to be honest, up until now we’ve mostly been playing games on our phones and reading the news online. We really want to be useful. We’re just not sure how.” Hmm. Definitely seems like the nation’s vice principals are confused about a lot of things. And to be fair, we don’t really have a clue what they’re supposed to be doing, either. Maybe no one does. But here’s hoping they’re nonetheless able to get some more clarity on their roles so that they can serve the students to the best of their abilities. "
A Piece Of History: The Blue Shell That Hit President John F. Kennedy’s Convertible In Dallas Is Coming To The Smithsonian,N/A,https://clickhole.com/a-piece-of-history-the-blue-shell-that-hit-president-john-f-kennedys-convertible-in-dallas-is-coming-to-the-smithsonian/,"History buffs are going to want to book a trip out to Washington D.C. as soon as possible, because one of the most infamous artifacts from America’s past is about to receive its first-ever curated exhibition to the public: The Blue Shell that hit President John F. Kennedy’s convertible in Dallas is coming to the Smithsonian. What an incredible chance to see one of the most impactful items of the 20th century! Once the 15,000-square-foot exhibit opens next Monday, visitors to the Smithsonian will be transported back in time to that tragic November morning when a seemingly routine Grand Prix race around the Dallas Speedway racetrack at the climax of the 150cc Flower Cup turned tragic mere seconds before JFK would have completed his third lap and won the gold. Placards near the entrance will explain how the 35th president had vied for first place with Texas Governor John Connally for much of the race, expertly powersliding around turns and dodging the level’s cactus obstacles until Connally’s chance collision with a Banana Peel allowed JFK to surge past him toward apparent victory. No sooner than JFK shouted “Let’s-a-go!” and accelerated into the home stretch, however, did the unmistakable siren of an approaching Blue Shell fired by Lee Harvey Oswald fill the air and forever alter the course of American history. A digital recreation projected near the Blue Shell’s display podium will break down just how severely the item launched JFK’s middleweight convertible: Advanced ballistics models will show how the powerful Blue Shell effortlessly tore through the Fake Item Box JFK dragged behind the convertible in a futile effort to protect himself, blasting the vehicle into a series of tumbling flips through the air while onlookers helplessly watched the horrific scene unfold. Though potentially too graphic for younger viewers, the video will unflinchingly depict the smoke that billowed from JFK as he spiraled back down to earth, as well as play the plaintive “Yow-wa-wa-wow-ow-ow!” that echoed across Dealey Plaza before the convertible finally bounced twice and fell into a water hazard as Connally, Oswald, and other racers sped past it across the finish line. In addition to the Blue Shell itself, the exhibit will feature a handful of other artifacts from that tragic day, such as the blood-spattered pink dress and crown worn by Princess Jackie Kennedy, the Lakitu’s Cloud that fished JFK’s convertible out of the water to place it back on the track, and the Super Mushroom LBJ used to hurry back to Washington upon assuming the presidency. The exhibit will also touch on the many unanswered questions that still swirl around the event, like how Lee Harvey Oswald was able to get the Blue Shell from an Item Box when he was only in 4th place, or why Kennedy failed to use his Boo powerup that would have rendered him impervious to the Blue Shell long enough to finish the race. Most intriguing of all, the Smithsonian will display newly unearthed documents suggesting that the CIA might have assisted Oswald due to JFK’s habit of using borderline unfair wall-jump shortcuts and a lingering resentment over JFK’s use of a Thunder Bolt knocking Allen Dulles’ kart from 2nd to a dismal 6th place finish on Castro’s Bay of Pigs Parkway two races prior. Wow, this is one exhibit that fans of American history will not want to miss. We look forward to seeing this Blue Shell up close in all its terrible glory once it goes on display next week! "
Keeping Things Fresh: Disney World Just Debuted A New ‘Summer Mickey’ That Hangs Around Disney Resort Pools In The Smallest Swimsuit You’ve Ever Seen,N/A,https://clickhole.com/keeping-things-fresh-disney-world-just-debuted-a-new-summer-mickey-that-hangs-around-disney-resort-pools-in-the-smallest-swimsuit-youve-ever-seen/,"If you thought that Disney had already perfected the theme park experience, think again, because they just found a way to make it more magical than ever: Disney World just debuted a new “Summer Mickey” that hangs around the resort pools in the smallest swimsuit you’ve ever seen.  Wow! Someone book us a flight to Orlando, STAT! Introduced earlier this week, the new Summer Mickey character can now be seen loitering around Disney resort swimming pools wearing his trademark G-string swimsuit and stealing gulps from unattended piña coladas. Excited guests have already reported encounters with Summer Mickey at Disney’s Animal Kingdom Lodge, where he’s been frequently spotted meandering listlessly around the pool area, occasionally stopping to let out a loud sigh or scratch himself against a palm tree.  One guest took to a Disney fans message board to describe his first-hand experience with Summer Mickey, saying that the scantily clad character joined him and his family in a hot tub, where he proceeded to lay back, spread his legs wide open, and fall fast asleep, snoring unresponsively as the man’s children futilely badgered him for an autograph. The guest added that once Summer Mickey finally woke up a couple of hours later, he got up and continued his aimless wandering around the pool area, at times pausing to crack his back or dry himself with a towel from the “USED” bin or curtly gesture for guests to give him food, until eventually tiring again and passing out face-down on the ground next to one of the kiddie pools.   “We’re thrilled to introduce Summer Mickey to Disney World and its resorts, and we invite our guests to say hi or grab a photo with him if you see him walking around,” said the theme park in a press release. “Never has Disney World had a character show this much skin, and we hope guests will be delighted by the sight of him loafing around in his Speedo while lathering himself in tanning oil and listening to Slovenian pop music on his portable Bluetooth speaker.”  So fun! We can’t wait to meet him! Leave it to Disney World to turn a family vacation into a lifelong memory. All we can say is that when it comes to theme park adventures, Disney has once again proven why it’s the gold standard. Awesome!"
Bleak Mike Forecast: Lookin’ Like It’s Gonna Be A Bad Summer For Mike,N/A,https://clickhole.com/bleak-mike-forecast-lookin-like-its-gonna-be-a-bad-summer-for-mike/,"Warm weather is upon us, and while the coming few months should be a fun and exciting time for most people, it seems that others won’t be so lucky: It’s lookin’ like it’s gonna be a bad summer for Mike. Ooh boy. We’re in for some high temps and a strong likelihood of Mike absolutely eating shit from June through August. As the days get longer and the weather more humid, you might want to pack your bags for a fun weekend getaway to the beach, unless you’re Mike, who is predicted to suffer an absolutely brutal and debilitating sunburn while mowing the lawn on the first warm weekend of the year and spend the subsequent months nursing his red, peeling skin while watching Pawn Stars in total darkness. Between the approaching ant infestation that will most likely hit Mike’s kitchen within days of the sunburn and a strong chance of Mike contracting Covid at the gym by late June, the intensity of the general suckiness heading Mike’s way cannot be overstated. There’s no knowing for sure, but all signs suggest that ‘ol Mike is really in for it. Experts foresee that Mike’s refusal to get up from his recliner will collide with his wife’s frustration at his disinterest in spending time with her sisters mid-July, resulting in a class 5 marital conflict that has the potential to make this the most dogshit summer of Mike’s entire life. In fact, some suggest that Mike’s home will see a veritable domestic El Nino throughout July and August, forcing Mike to sleep on the couch for nights on end and setting off a chain of disastrous Mike events involving back pain, heartburn, and an unprecedented Mike Depression of epic proportions. Wow. This year’s Mike forecast is not looking good at all. Mike is going to want to batten down the hatches and prepare to withstand a rough summer, because if the data is to be believed, it’s going to be a pretty bad one."
What Could’ve Been: A New Poll Has Found That Hilary Clinton Would Have Won The 2016 Election If She Dressed Like She Was In ‘The Matrix’,N/A,https://clickhole.com/what-couldve-been-a-new-poll-has-found-that-hilary-clinton-would-have-won-the-2016-election-if-she-dressed-like-she-was-in-the-matrix/,"Over six years after the 2016 election, political analysts are still conducting post-mortems to determine which factors ultimately led to Donald Trump’s upset win, but it appears that experts have finally pinpointed the primary cause of the shocking outcome: According to an exhaustive nationwide poll, Hilary Clinton would have won the 2016 presidential election if she had dressed like she was in The Matrix throughout the entirety of her campaign. Wow! It’s incredible how just a few minor changes in her campaign strategy could have completely altered the course of history! According to the poll, which was conducted by the Pew Research Center, millions of Americans who voted for Donald Trump, a third party candidate, or declined to vote entirely, would instead have immediately cast their vote for Hillary Clinton if she had campaigned while wearing a long, black leather trench coat, sunglasses, and knee-high black leather boots in a style reminiscent of the characters in the 1999 sci-fi film The Matrix. Dressing in this manner, the poll indicated, would’ve resulted in a landslide victory for the Clinton campaign. The poll also found that Clinton’s margin of victory would’ve grown greater and greater the more she committed to looking like a character from The Matrix. Had she been lowered onto the debate stage by wires while dressed head-to-toe in leather like Trinity, she would have won in perennial Republican strongholds like Mississippi and Alabama, and if she had campaigned while wearing her hair in long white dreadlocks like the Albino twins from The Matrix Reloaded, she would have secured the staunchly conservative Texas and its 38 electoral votes. “While political analysts have attributed Clinton’s 2016 to many factors, including her failure to campaign in key swing states and her deep connections to an unpopular political establishment, this survey indicates that millions of Americans who voted for Donald Trump or refrained from voting would have immediately forgiven these shortcomings if she had essentially cosplayed as Neo or Trinity for the duration of the election,” stated the Pew study. “American voters would’ve especially liked to see Ms. Clinton storming onstage at public events holding a huge machine gun in each hand, or perhaps even contorting her body in slow motion to dodge incoming projectiles.” Furthermore, the poll found that hundreds of thousands of Americans who simply refused to vote in the 2016 election would have “waited in line at the polls for 48 hours or more” to vote for Hillary if she had appeared on TV wearing those sunglasses that somehow stay on your face just by balancing on your nose like Morpheus has, and thousands more who identified themselves as “passionate Trump supporters” stated they would have instead voted for Clinton if she had held a rally in their state where she promised to defend Zion from the machines at any cost. Clinton’s choice of attire isn’t the only fashion decision that could have impacted the results of the 2016 election. The Pew survey also found that Senator Bernie Sanders would have won the 2016 Democratic Primaries if he had campaigned while wearing a Hawaiian shirt, and would have defeated Donald Trump in a landslide during the presidential election if he had responded to every debate question with, “Who cares about that bullshit, mamacita? I’m on Island Time right now!”  It just goes to show what a fickle and complex game American politics can be! It really seems like the current political landscape in the United States would be absolutely unrecognizable if Hillary had just realized that what the American people want is a presidential candidate who looks like a steampunk weirdo who just jacked into the Matrix to help The One lead humanity to freedom. It’s amazing how the outcome of an entire presidential election can come down to little details like how long your trench coat is or whether or not you can convince voters that you’ve had enough kung-fu downloaded into your brain to fight Agent Smith. Future U.S. presidential candidates would be wise to start investing in skin-tight leather pants and katanas right away, as the success of their political careers just might depend on it!"
Better Late Than Never: Barack Obama Just Learned While Editing His Own Wikipedia Page That Sasha And Malia Aren’t Twins,N/A,https://clickhole.com/better-late-than-never-barack-obama-just-learned-while-editing-his-own-wikipedia-page-that-sasha-and-malia-arent-twins/,"If you think you’re out of touch with your family, take comfort knowing that you’re probably doing a better job than this former POTUS, who’s only now realizing how deeply out of the loop he is on his daughters’ lives: Barack Obama just learned while editing his own Wikipedia page that Sasha and Malia aren’t twins. Wow. Barack probably should’ve known that, but hey, better to find out now than never at all. Earlier this morning, Barack had been holed up in his office, editing the intro of his Wikipedia page to read that he ‘is a Spotify Premium user who served as President of 44th President of the United States’, when something in the ‘Family And Personal Life’ section made him do a double-take—his page suggested that his daughters Malia and Sasha were born on separate days in separate years, and were in fact not twins at all, as he’d believed to be the case for as long as he could remember. “No, no, that can’t be right…can it?” muttered the 44th President as he racked his brain, having never once questioned his assumption that Malia and Sasha were twin sisters born on September 11, 2001—a date that Barack soon realized neither of his daughters were born on, which served as an even bigger surprise considering he’d given them a mountain of presents and a large cake on that day every single year since they were little girls.  No matter how many times he told himself it was simply an error—despite the legitimate news sources that the information about his daughters’ birth dates were linked to in his page’s footnotes—Barack’s confidence that his daughters were fraternal twins had been thrown into uncertainty. Barack elected to call Michelle for answers, who immediately confirmed that Sasha and Malia were indeed not twins at all, but born three whole years apart.  “Well I’ll be…” Barack shrugged and moved on, heading to the ‘Legacy’ section of his Wikipedia page to insert a paragraph explaining how he’d won a Grammy for his decision to assassinate Osama Bin Laden. “Glad I realized that now instead of in front of Sasha and Malia.” Yikes. While most parents would know if their children were twins or not after 20 years of raising them, Barack Obama isn’t like most parents, and one glance at his Wikipedia page will prove that. So, late to the game or not, we can’t say that this is anything but a good thing for Barack to have realized. Don’t sweat it, Barack, these kinds of things happen to the best of us!"
"Makes It All Worth It: After $240,000 In Tuition, These College Graduates Were Rewarded With A 25 Minute Speech About The Importance Of Patience From The CEO Of A Printer Company",N/A,https://clickhole.com/makes-it-all-worth-it-after-240000-in-tuition-these-college-graduates-were-rewarded-with-a-25-minute-speech-about-the-importance-of-patience-from-the-ceo-of-a-printer-company/,"It isn’t easy graduating college in 2022 into such an uncertain world, but if anything makes that experience worth it, it’s knowing you’ve been equipped with the wisdom and knowledge you need to handle everything life throws at you: After $240,000 in tuition, these college graduates were rewarded with a 25 minute speech about the importance of patience from the CEO of a printer company. Amazing! Now they’ve got everything they need to thrive in the real world! After working as hard as they could for four long years, the Grayskill College Class of 2022 received a gift that truly fit their private education’s $240K price tag when the CEO of Lexmark Printers delivered a powerful and incisive speech advising them to view life as a journey, not a destination, and to relish the twists, turns, and detours their trajectory will bring them. Frankly, even the mere opportunity to be in the same room as this awesome CEO while he shared how he learned to appreciate the small things as he rose to the top of a printer company, that albeit isn’t one of the main ones like HP or Canon but is still a really respected brand, is basically worth an additional $50K. As many of the graduates spend the next 20 years paying off the hundreds of thousands of dollars in student loans that they took out as teenagers, they’ll undoubtedly see each and every interest-bloated payment as money well spent, as you really can’t put a price tag on all the profound wisdom the CEO shared, including his incredible and life-affirming observation that “Growing up is a lot like waiting for pages to print: Though it may feel like it’s taking a long time in the moment, in the end you realize that it was all worth the wait.” Because ultimately, if anyone can understand the struggles of a 22-year-old who’s graduating into a pandemic-destroyed economy riddled with inflation and labor exploitation, it’s the Lexmark CEO, who offered such sage advice like, “Learning to be patient is not easy, but it is going to make life easier once you do.” Wow. Such enlightening words! When it comes down to it, this commencement speaker didn’t just give these students a speech—he gave them a blueprint for success. And that’s worth more than all the student loans in the world. Congrats to the Grayskill Class of 2022! There’s no doubt that the lessons from this commencement address will guide you and bring you prosperity for the rest of your lives. "
Selfish And Wrong: This Person Who Just Got Surgery Actually Tried Taking Up A Friend’s Offer To Let Them Know If There Was Anything They Could Do To Help,N/A,https://clickhole.com/selfish-and-wrong-this-person-who-just-got-surgery-actually-tried-taking-up-a-friends-offer-to-let-them-know-if-there-was-anything-they-could-do-to-help/,"We hate to have to remind you that the world is filled with greedy, egotistical people, but a recent act of pure selfishness was so egregious that it just can’t be ignored: This woman who just got surgery actually tried taking up her friend’s offer to let her know if there was anything she could do to help.  Incredible. Does she think the entire world revolves around her? When 28-year-old April Christenson had surgery to remove a growth from her hip, her best friend, Krissy Steen, did what any good friend would do and sent her a text reading, “Please, don’t hesitate to let me know if there’s anything at all I can do to help. I mean it.” Of course, anyone who isn’t a completely self-obsessed narcissist would have responded, “Oh, thank you so much, but I’ll be fine,” and then gone about her daily chores in extreme pain while completely exhausted,—but not Queen April. Nope, just two days after Krissy’s incredibly generous message, April had the gall to text Krissy and ask her if it would be possible for her to pick up a few essentials from the grocery store and drop them off at her house. Wow. April seems to think that just because her friend reached out and offered a helping hand, she can go around making whatever sick, selfish demands she can think of.  Thanks to April’s completely inappropriate request, Krissy, who already had plans this evening to watch a little Netflix and maybe meet a friend for a drink, is now forced to pretend that she didn’t see the text in hopes that April follows up saying she found someone else to do it. And even worse, if she doesn’t hear anything soon, Krissy may actually have to squander 45 precious minutes of her evening, all because April is under the impression that you can completely hijack a friend’s life if they so much as suggest that they can help you out while you’re bedridden after major surgery. Look, April: You’ve been out of the hospital for a full 48 hours. Everyone else in the world has moved on from your whole surgery thing. There’s a way these things are supposed to go, which is you tell people you’re having surgery, they express concern, and that’s that. A friend’s direct, clear offer of help is no excuse for actually asking them for help, and everyone on earth knows that besides, apparently, you. If you really need something, try calling someone who you’re actually close with, like your parents who live four states away, or maybe your recent ex-boyfriend. Shame on you, April. We’d expect behavior this selfish from a child, but not a grown woman.  You really feel for Krissy in this situation, because from now on she’s going to have to think twice before offering favors to her friends like the kind, loving person she is. You’d hate to see the selfish acts of people like April force saints like Krissy to stop making incredibly generous yet ultimately empty promises, but if April can’t rein in her poor behavior that just might happen. What’s next, April, actually calling a friend who said to give them a call anytime you needed to talk? Stopping by someone’s house after they said, “Stop by anytime?” Yikes. Seek help, woman. "
Well That Sucks: This Woman Is Mentally Ill Enough That It Makes Her Life Miserable But Not So Mentally Ill That Anyone Really Cares,N/A,https://clickhole.com/well-that-sucks-this-woman-is-mentally-ill-enough-that-it-makes-her-life-miserable-but-not-so-mentally-ill-that-anyone-really-cares/,"If you’ve ever been caught between a rock and a hard place, you’ll probably relate to this story about a woman in a truly unenviable situation: This woman is mentally ill enough that it makes her life miserable but not so mentally ill that anyone really cares. Well, that’s not good. Bella Cuffe of New York suffers from potentially the worst kind of depression and anxiety possible, where her mental ailments are severe enough that she spends a good 70 percent of her life dealing with intrusive negative thoughts and low mood, but not so severe that anyone in her life feels the need to step in and help out. Bella works in marketing, and she is just functional enough to get through a typical 9-to-5 work day without any sort of outburst or breakdown. But if she had just slightly less control, she might randomly burst into uncontrollable sobs in front of her coworkers, forcing them to inquire about her condition and try to support her somehow, but unfortunately she is able to convincingly hide all that until she gets home from work and can collapse into a heap of fear, anxiety, and mental anguish in private. In fact, Bella’s deep-seated feelings of despondence only push her over the edge into total paralysis around once a month, which is the perfect interval where coworkers and loved ones think it’s totally normal for her to take a sick day or skip out on plans. Thus, she is left totally alone to pick up the pieces, and when she’s finished dragging herself out of a deep hole of pain by sheer force of will, everyone just asks “Did you have a fun day off?” Yikes! Bella has truly struck a terrible balance here. Bella spends so much time reading self-help books, listening to podcasts, and watching YouTube videos about overcoming anxiety and depression that she has a veritable armory of tools at her disposal now for subduing her issues, making sure that she never takes them out on anyone but herself, and thus that no one else particularly gives a shit. Sure, she looks kind of sad sometimes, but it’s the type of sad people chalk up to a breakup or a bad day, not the tip of an iceberg of mental illness that has been carefully hidden from view. It would probably be a good thing in the end if Bella really freaked out and did something that obviously reads as nuts, like going off on someone at work or disappearing into the woods for a few days, but she doesn’t really seem headed down that path. And if she keeps up with her normal routine of just worrying silently, there’s basically zero chance anyone will dig deep enough to make sense of what she’s dealing with or invest in her situation enough to give her the practical and emotional help she needs to recover. At this rate, she’s pretty much doomed to her miserable existence, which is probably fine, because she’s very used to it. If only she was more overtly fucked up! It really sucks when you have a degree of mental illness like Bella’s, which is not quite enough to elicit sympathy, but just enough that that sympathy would be very helpful. Let’s cross our fingers for Bella, because something in her situation has gotta give! We’re not going to look into it or anything, obviously, but we’re hoping for the best."
Must Somehow Be Important To The Crime? This Chalk Outline Of The Body At A Crime Scene Includes The Guy’s Cock And Balls And Asshole And Everything,N/A,https://clickhole.com/must-somehow-be-important-to-the-crime-this-chalk-outline-of-the-body-at-a-crime-scene-includes-the-guys-cock-and-balls-and-asshole-and-everything/,"Here’s a mystery within a mystery that will have you scratching your head and looking for answers: This chalk outline of a body at a crime scene includes the guy’s cock and balls and asshole and everything.  Hmm. Wonder what that’s all about…. While police on the scene were unable to provide any information on the matter due to it being an ongoing investigation, the fact that they took such great care to meticulously trace the penis (glans included), bunghole, and each individual testicle suggests that knowing exactly where and how the victim’s junk flopped after he was killed is somehow critical to solving the crime. Judging from size, it appears that the penis was flaccid, so we can at least conclude that the guy didn’t have a boner at the time of death, although we’re admittedly unsure if this information is in any way relevant to the case. For now, all we can really do is speculate. Perhaps the killer had tiny, fucked-up genitals and murdered the victim out of jealousy over his normal, evenly proportioned shaft and balls. Or perhaps the victim was a drug mule who’d stashed heroin in his anus or cock hole. Or maybe the victim was caught in the throes of some forbidden sexual act that sent the killer into a murderous rage (e.g., banging the guy’s wife or mom or dog or something). There are literally countless possibilities as to why investigators chose to outline the wiener, nuts, and b-hole while excluding other anatomical details like fingers and facial features, and we could speculate all day, but just throwing out random guesses isn’t gonna get us any closer to cracking the case.   God, we just really wanna know what the deal is.  We’ll definitely be eagerly following this story for updates, although if we’re being entirely honest here, we’re really just interested in learning why the victim’s naughty bits were included in the chalk outline, and we don’t really care about solving the crime itself. Still, we hope investigators are able to get to the bottom of it, and we send our condolences to the family of the victim. From what we can tell, it seems like he was a great guy."
Mean But True: The Fun Fact On The Side Of This U-Haul Is That There Are No Tens In Pennsylvania,N/A,https://clickhole.com/mean-but-true-the-fun-fact-on-the-side-of-this-u-haul-is-that-there-are-no-tens-in-pennsylvania/,"U-Haul has always delighted travelers by including cool trivia facts about states on the side of their trucks, and it turns out the company doesn’t shy away from factoids that are just as harsh as they are interesting: The fun fact on the side of this U-Haul is that there are no tens in Pennsylvania.  Woof. That’s definitely brutal, but they do make a pretty good point. Painted on the side of this U-Haul currently parked in Wilmington, NC is text that reads, “Did you know… There are no 10s in Pennsylvania! Whether you were born and raised in PA, or currently living there, you are sort of hot at best!” U-Haul’s damning, but ultimately fair claim is further supported by a photo of several famous Pennsylvanians with their corresponding attractiveness ratings: Ben Franklin (2), Taylor Swift (6), Rocky Balboa (4), Allen Iverson (5), Phillie Phanatic (7).  U-Haul didn’t have to do PA like this, but no lies were told. Additional rationale from U-Haul is provided on a section of their website titled, “Learn More About Ugly Pennsylvanians!” where they state, “From the crackhead, cheesesteak-loving street urchins of Philadelphia, to the puffy Midwesterners who were too stupid to hack it in Cincinnati of Pittsburgh, no one in Pennsylvania’s major cities is all that good looking, and tragically, it only gets worse in the rest of the state. With coal country packed with toothless, white trash 2s and 3s, and Amish country full of dour, sexless 3s and 4s, it’s a wonder that Pennsylvania was ever able to produce Adam McKay, the 8.5 Adonis, at all. While Pennsylvania doesn’t have the ugliest residents of all states – an award that instead goes to the pasty blobs of Minnesota – the fact of the matter is that there’s a level of attractiveness you just can’t reach when you’re wearing an XXL Donovan McNabb jersey, holding a Wawa hoagie in one hand and a Yuengling in the other.” Damn. Can’t say we ever thought about how PA doesn’t have any 10s before, but this honestly makes a lot of sense. After all, the state’s best known for the Liberty Bell, which is famously ugly as fuck. Sorry, Pennsylvania!"
"Body Positivity Win! This Old Hag Who Lives In The Forest Is Telling Lost, Overweight Children That They Look Delicious",N/A,https://clickhole.com/body-positivity-win-this-old-hag-who-lives-in-the-forest-is-telling-lost-overweight-children-that-they-look-delicious/,"Despite the body positivity movement’s recent strides, it’s still tough to be a chubby kid, but thankfully there’s one good soul out there doing her part to change that: This old hag who lives in the forest is telling lost, overweight children that they look delicious. Yes! This is just the body positivity win we needed today! Griselda Blackleach, a resident of the woods outside Dover, Delaware, is an incredible woman who regularly helps boost overweight kids’ self-esteem by reminding them that their plump, juicy bodies are nothing to be ashamed of—and that in fact, they look good enough to eat. Griselda stalks the woods at dusk each day in search of wandering orphans and runaways, and when she comes across a child who’s struggling with their weight, she goes out of her way to gleefully pinch their chubby rolls and offer an empowering cackle while letting them know that their flesh looks much more delectable than that of their bony, low-BMI counterparts. If these kids ever looked in the mirror and felt bad about their shape, they certainly won’t anymore after meeting Griselda, who always makes a point to say that their bodies are “perfect—mmm, yes, just what I need!” This is so awesome!  Griselda will stop at nothing to help out these lost, overweight children. Not only does she make them feel special by offering them sweets and inviting them into her remote cabin in a hazy, secluded clearing, but she also lets them spend the night, even going so far as to rub them down with butter and oils in a self-care spa experience that kids like them rarely get treated to. It’s probably not often that these plumper kids feel special or get positive attention, but under Griselda’s watch, they are the prettiest, most delectable looking children in the entire world, and that counts for a lot. In fact, many feel so accepted at Griselda’s cabin that they never even leave. Wow. This story has us in tears. Kids are so vulnerable, and it’s incredibly heartening to know that there’s someone out there stepping up to promote their wellbeing. Griselda Blackleach, you have officially restored our faith in humanity."
"Disturbing: After An Exhaustive Investigation, The Justice Department Has Discovered That Underneath All The Glitz And Glam Hollywood Has A Dark Side ",N/A,https://clickhole.com/disturbing-after-an-exhaustive-investigation-the-justice-department-has-discovered-that-underneath-all-the-glitz-and-glam-hollywood-has-a-dark-side/,"From the outside looking in, Hollywood has always appeared to be a picture-perfect paradise, where the world’s most beautiful and gifted performers convene to walk the red carpet and make magic happen on the silver screen. However, a bombshell report from the Justice Department suggests that life among the stars isn’t always the fairytale it seems—in fact, underneath all the glitz and glamor, Hollywood actually has a bit of a dark side. Wow. Never in a million years could we have expected this.  Earlier today, the Justice Department released a 432-page report titled, “Sunset On Sunset: The Darkest Side Of The Brightest Place,” which details the disturbing findings of an exhaustive, seven-year investigation into certain unsavory activities occurring beyond the public eye in Hollywood. Featuring page after page of shocking new information gathered by wiretaps, hidden cameras, and undercover informants, the report challenges the conventional narrative of Tinseltown as a happy, problem-free fantasyland with troubling evidence of all kinds of behind-the-scenes drama, from angry outbursts, acts of infidelity, and, yes, even possibly illicit drug use.  One section of the report provides a harrowing first-hand account of an unnamed A-list starlet making a farce of her squeaky clean public image with a myriad of heinous behaviors, from recreational marijuana consumption to issuing rude remarks towards members of a production crew. Another section of the report provides compelling evidence of a widely beloved leading man engaging in depraved premarital conduct with not only one but multiple partners, including two documented instances of partaking in intercourse outside of wedlock after having consumed wine.  “We overturned every grimy rock and explored every seedy alleyway in La La Land,” said lead investigator Lysa Gerring, “What we discovered wasn’t always as pretty as the diamond-encrusted facade we see on the big screen. Our investigation revealed that it’s almost like there are two Hollywoods: the picture-perfect one we see on the award shows that we all grew up idolizing, and the hidden side no one sees because it’s kept in the shadows. We found that this city can lure you in with its promises of fortune and fame just as easily as it can chew you up and spit you out. If you thought that everything in Hollywood was happiness and sunshine, think again—turns out that is sometimes not the case.” Jesus. This is absolutely chilling, to say the least. The Justice Department has yet to announce if they have plans to press any charges based on the results of their investigation, but arrests or not, this is certainly going to shake up how the world looks at Hollywood. What do you think: Does knowing that Hollywood has a dark side turn you off to the whole world of celebrities and movies, or does knowing Hollywood isn’t so perfect after all only serve to make it more interesting? Let us know in the comments!"
Pursuing New Passions: BTS Has Rebranded As The ‘Sons Of Orion Explorers Brigade’ After Finding A Telescope In A Dumpster And Getting Super Into Space,N/A,https://clickhole.com/pursuing-new-passions-bts-has-rebranded-as-the-sons-of-orion-explorers-brigade-after-finding-a-telescope-in-a-dumpster-and-getting-super-into-space/,"One of the world’s biggest pop groups just made a massive career shift that’s sure to send shockwaves through the music world: BTS has rebranded as the “Sons Of Orion Explorers Brigade” after finding a telescope in a dumpster and getting super into space! Wow! While this’ll be a tough pill for fans to swallow, you can’t blame BTS for pursuing their passion. The wildly popular boy group made the shocking announcement via a video posted on their social media accounts earlier this morning, in which all seven members of the now-former K-pop act—Jin, Suga, RM, J-Hope, Jimin, V, and Jungkook—explained the decision while sitting in a planetarium with the “Star Trek” theme song playing quietly in the background. “Hello to all the fans of BTS in the world, we have big news to tell you all, and it is that J-Hope was digging around in the garbage yesterday and found a telescope, and now the only thing we like is looking at the stars and planets,” RM says at the start of the video, after which J-Hope gives a thumbs up and waves the telescope at the camera. “I was looking for jewels in the trash, but instead I found this telescope, and it is a more valuable treasure than any jewel, because it shows to us the beauty of outer space,” J-Hope explains. “We will not be making any more music, because now we are named the Sons Of Orion Explorers Brigade, and what we like to do is discover new asteroids and make charts and graphs about the orbit of Mercury,” says Jimin. “We are no longer BTS. Our new name is now Sons Of Orion Explorers Brigade, and we have dedicated our lives to astronomy,” says V. “Music is trivial when compared to the majesty of outer space, which is why we will not be making songs anymore,” Jin adds. “You can still call us BTS if you want, but from now on BTS stands for ‘Behold! The Stars!’ and nothing else.” The video concludes with Jungkook shouting, “I don’t like music, I like space!” followed by his band members nodding in agreement and saying things like, “Saturn is beautiful” and “I love to observe the moon.” Damn. It looks like BTS is officially no more.  In a follow-up post on social media, the Sons Of Orion Explorers Brigade announced some huge upcoming changes that will be sure to leave fans of the band once known as BTS reeling. The group will be removing all music recorded under the BTS name from all streaming platforms, including Spotify and Apple Music, and will be replacing their songs with a single audio track of the seven members of the Songs Of Orion Explorers Brigade reciting the names of all the planets in unison. The Sons Of Orion will also cancel all upcoming concerts so that they have more time for stargazing in the evenings with their telescope. Additionally, Jungkook has changed his name to “Galileo’s Brother” and Jin has changed his name to “The Fabulous Mr. Black Hole.” The Sons Of Orion Explorers Brigade went on to say that their new goal as a group is to “spread the love of telescopes to the youth of the world” and to “make people agree that Jupiter is huge.” While they will no longer be making public appearances so that they can dedicate more time to examining the heavens through their dumpster telescope, the former pop superstars will be occasionally tweeting out star charts documenting the movements of celestial bodies such as comets and meteors, which they are encouraging their fans to share on Twitter with the hashtag “#SpaceIsCoolerThanMusic”. This is truly the end of an era for pop music, but we’re so glad the Sons Of Orion Explorers Brigade will now be able to spend their time drinking in the majesty of the cosmos! It just goes to show that when you go looking for jewels in a dumpster, you just might end up finding a telescope instead and discovering a newfound love of outer space. We wish the Sons Of Orion Explorers Brigade all the luck in the world as they begin this new chapter of their lives—the sky is literally the limit!"
"Please Shut Up, Losers: These People Are Talking About A Movie They Saw And What Happened In It",N/A,https://clickhole.com/please-shut-up-losers-these-people-are-talking-about-a-movie-they-saw-and-what-happened-in-it/,"Brace yourself, because what you are about to read describes one of the dumbest, most annoying things that has ever happened: These people are talking about a movie they saw and what happened in it. Oh, God. Please shut up, losers. We are begging you to shut up. In what is potentially the greatest waste of time in human history, this group of friends just exited a movie theater yapping a mile a minute about the movie they saw, and now they’ve sat down in a nearby bar to—you guessed it—say even more stuff about that very same movie. These absolute dorks spent 15 entire minutes literally just going over what took place in the movie, pausing to interrupt each other with questions like, “Wait, so what was the deal with the uncle character?” and “Was the weird train scene supposed to be a dream or a flashback?” as if they were cracking some sort of cold case rather than straight-up recapping the thing they all watched together mere minutes before.  After spending two long hours watching the movie and everything that happened in it, you’d think these nerds would just want to have a regular conversation about regular things, like their jobs or relationships or weekend plans, but annoyingly, they decided it would somehow be more enjoyable to sit there and catalog all the characters and plot points from the movie they’d just seen, taking a fucking eternity to rehash the same goddamn details they could get from 30 seconds of skimming the plot summary section on the movie’s Wikipedia page. And even worse, they all seemed to think that their opinions on the movie were in some way valuable, going on and on and on about whether certain characters were likable or not likable (their consensus: good guys = likable, bad guys = unlikable), or whether the actors who played them did a good job. You’d think that being in a bar drinking alcohol would change up their mood and get them talking about something else, but nope—just an endless, insufferable parade of unsolicited, run-of-the-mill opinions on a make-believe story they’d already spent most of their night watching.  You watched the movie. Is that not enough for you? Jesus Christ, just end this conversation. God, how can this possibly be enjoyable for them? It is hard to fathom a more boring thing to talk about. Someone tell these idiots to stop saying words. The movie is over. Please, please, just go home and be quiet."
And You’re Just Telling Us This Now?!? Mom Just Revealed That 35 Years Ago She Was In The E Street Band As Bruce Springsteen’s Guitar Pick,N/A,https://clickhole.com/and-youre-just-telling-us-this-now-mom-just-revealed-that-35-years-ago-she-was-in-the-e-street-band-as-bruce-springsteens-guitar-pick/,"Get ready for a seriously wild update about Mom that is definitely going to change the way you think of her from here on out: Mom just revealed that 35 years ago she was in the E Street Band as Bruce Springsteen’s guitar pick.  Wait, what?!? How is she only JUST NOW telling us this? Mom, who as far as we knew didn’t even like music all that much, made the bombshell announcement earlier tonight at dinner when everyone was talking about the best concert they’d ever been to. We all figured Mom would say the time she and her girlfriends went to see John Mayer in, like, 2006, but she instead said, “Well, I don’t know if I could pick a show specifically, but the ‘Born in the USA’ tour was a really great time—at least from my vantage point onstage.” This information immediately prompted many follow up questions, to which Mom replied, “What? I’m sure I told you guys I used to be Springsteen’s guitar pick,” even though she most certainly never told us she was in his band during one of his most iconic eras ever. Holy shit! Up until this point, we thought her only encounter with a celebrity was when she saw Dr. Phil at a gas station in Connecticut! To prove her story, Mom then got out an old photo album to show us a picture of The Boss holding her in his hand while he played “Glory Days” at a concert in Nashville. “It was fun while it lasted, but one night, right at the end of ‘Rosalita,’ he just threw me into the crowd and got out a different pick instead,” said Mom. “Then I met your father, and that was that,” she added before she started clearing the table, which signaled to all of us that there’d be no further discussion of the matter. Wow. Apparently there’s a whole side of Mom that we’re totally unaware of. Not gonna lie, we’re pretty impressed. Guess the old gal isn’t as lame and uninteresting as we thought. Way to go, Mom! "
Guess It’s How He Wanted It? Grandpa’s Been Positioned Spread-Eagle At His Open Casket Funeral ,N/A,https://clickhole.com/guess-its-how-he-wanted-it-grandpas-been-positioned-spread-eagle-at-his-open-casket-funeral/,"Grandpa’s death has been hard to process, but it’s a comfort to see one of his last wishes—or at least what we’re presuming to be a last wish?—being honored in such a thoughtful way: Grandpa is positioned spread-eagle at his open casket funeral. Huh. It’s not like the funeral home would do this unprompted…this had to be in his will, or a deathbed request he made in his final days, right? Though Grandpa’s funeral has been pretty standard fare otherwise, it’s certainly surprising to see him lying there with his legs lifted up out of his coffin and stretched apart as far as they’ll go. But considering that no one who was involved in planning the event seems to be batting an eye about Grandpa’s titillating pose as they kneel to pay their respects, not even Grandma, we can only assume that this is exactly how Grandpa wanted his loved ones to remember him. No one in the family ever saw Grandpa splayed out like this when he was alive, not even once, but he appears so peacefully at rest in his coffin that you’d think he lived his entire life spread-eagle. This has to be intentional…like, if the mortician made a mistake, someone would’ve called it out by now, no doubt. Yeah, 99% chance that Grandpa wanted his remains displayed like this.  Well, good for him! If Grandpa requested this, then he deserves it, because he was the best grandparent anyone could ask for. He’s probably looking down from Heaven and smiling at the spread-eagle sendoff that it’s reasonable to assume he so badly wanted. Rest in peace, Grandpa—we’re going to miss you so much!"
Clapping Back: MLB Has Addressed Complaints About Baseball Being Too Slow By Making The Games 8 Hours Long And More Tedious Than Ever To Show How Fucking Good Fans Had It,N/A,https://clickhole.com/clapping-back-the-mlb-has-addressed-complaints-about-baseball-being-too-slow-by-making-the-games-8-hours-long-and-more-tedious-than-ever-to-show-how-fucking-good-fans-had-it/,"For years, Major League Baseball has been plagued by complaints from viewers that games take too long and move too slowly. But now, at long last, it looks like league officials are completely fed up with the constant criticism: Earlier today, the MLB announced that they are addressing complaints about baseball being too slow by making the games eight hours long and more tedious than ever to show fans how fucking good they had it. Damn. This is one epic clapback from the powers that be at Major League Baseball. “All you ungrateful fuckers do is whine about how long baseball games are, but now you’re about to see how much worse it can get,” said MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred, Jr. at a press conference this morning. “We’re overhauling the rules of baseball to make it such a tremendous marathon of boredom and inefficiency that within a week you’ll be begging us to go back to the way things were.” Manfred then proceeded to rattle off a long laundry list of new rules and regulations that will prolong each baseball game well past the eight-hour mark. Here are just a few of the changes that fans can expect: – Umpires will no longer call balls and strikes out loud. Instead, after each pitch, the umpire will whisper “ball” or “strike” into the batter’s ear, and then walk around the entire field whispering the call into each fielder’s ear individually. – Relief pitchers will not accompany their team to the stadium, and will instead stay at home. If a manager wishes to bring in a relief pitcher, he must call the pitcher at his house and wait for him to drive to the stadium. – It will now take 12 outs to end the 6th inning. – Instead of the catcher throwing the ball back to the pitcher, after every pitch, the catcher will be required to walk the ball back to the pitcher’s mound, hand the ball to the pitcher, shake his hand, and say, “Thank you for that marvelous pitch.” If the catcher fails to thank the pitcher, the pitch will not count, and the at-bat must be started all over again. – Teams must now win by at least two points like in tennis. – A video review will now take place after each pitch to confirm the call. – After a batter hits a home run, instead of briskly jogging around the bases, he must now slowly crawl the whole way in order for the home run to count.  – “Take Me Out To The Ballgame” and “God Bless America” will now be sung after the top of every inning, not just the 7th.  – The 4th inning will now happen twice. “Let’s see how much you whiny little shits like baseball now!” Manfred shrieked before cackling maniacally into the microphone for several minutes. “You were living the high life and you never appreciated it. You always wanted faster, faster, faster. Now you’re going to learn that the game was fast enough as it was, but it’s too late for you rubes to ever go back to the halcyon days of the speedy three-hour game. Baseball will be a joyless, eight-hour slog forevermore, and it’s all your fault!” Manfred concluded the press conference giving everyone present the middle finger and strutting off into a waiting limousine, which drove away with Manfred’s middle finger still extended through the sunroof. Wow! It looks like fans really shot themselves in the foot by complaining so much. Maybe we should’ve just learned to appreciate the simple, slow-paced joys of the sport instead of always griping about how watching a baseball game is basically a half-day time commitment. Now the commissioner is punishing us by making the games longer than ever, and we only have ourselves to blame."
Heartbreaking: This Man Is Being Haunted By Slimer But He Can’t Call The Ghostbusters Because They Aren’t Real,N/A,https://clickhole.com/heartbreaking-this-man-is-being-haunted-by-slimer-but-he-cant-call-the-ghostbusters-because-they-arent-real/,"It’s incredibly frustrating to find yourself in a difficult situation that you’re powerless to change, but it’s even more frustrating when there’s no one else you can turn to for help in your time of need. Case in point: This man is being haunted by Slimer, but he can’t call the Ghostbusters to get rid of him because the Ghostbusters aren’t real. God, how heartbreaking! Poor guy. Three weeks ago, Mark Schueller, a 45-year-old music teacher from Bend, Oregon, came home from work to find Slimer the obese green ghost flying around his kitchen grunting like a hog and messily gorging himself on all the food he could get his hands on. “He was stuffing an entire roast chicken and honey-glazed ham in his mouth at the same time while whizzing through the air knocking over everything in my kitchen,” says Mark. “I knew the only way to get rid of him was to call the Ghostbusters so that they could vacuum him up with their nuclear-powered proton packs, but unfortunately for me the Ghostbusters are fictional characters. How am I supposed to get rid of Slimer when the only people who can stop him are imaginary men from an ‘80s movie?” It’s truly terrible that the Ghostbusters aren’t real, because Mark says that being haunted by Slimer has made every aspect of his life a living hell. Last week, Mark had his mother over for dinner, and Slimer transported through the ceiling from upstairs and dove face-first onto the table, splattering Mark’s poor mom with a shower of mashed potatoes and gravy as he noisily devoured every scrap of food in sight. Then Slimer used his enormous tongue to lick all the food off of the old woman’s face, and he was so overzealous that he also slurped up her pearl necklace and her wig, leaving her bald, weeping, and covered in ectoplasm while Slimer continued to zoom around the kitchen wildly flailing his arms around and screaming like a lunatic. “My mom was standing there crying and all I could do was try to swat Slimer away with a rolled up magazine, but my hand just whizzed right through his transparent body because he’s a ghost,” said Mark. “It’s times like these that I wish I could call trained professionals to hunt him down with ghost-detecting goggles and use positron collider guns to trap him in an ecto-containment unit, but sadly people like that only exist in the movies.” Unfortunately for Mark, Slimer’s antics have only gotten worse as the haunting has continued. His grocery bills have nearly tripled because every time he brings food home, Slimer immediately materializes out of thin air and empties the contents of the grocery bags directly into his mouth. Like the thousands of people who have been haunted by Slimer before him, Mark will probably have to move to a new city or commit suicide in order to free himself from the hideous green phantom. How helpless he must feel knowing that the only people who can save him from Slimer are fictional characters invented by Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis decades ago!"
Time To Grow Up: Mick Jagger Has Changed His Name To Mark Jagger,N/A,https://clickhole.com/time-to-grow-up-mick-jagger-has-changed-his-name-to-mark-jagger/,"One of rock ‘n’ roll’s most legendary artists just made a huge announcement that is sure to send shockwaves through the music world: Mick Jagger has revealed that he’s putting the childish name “Mick Jagger” behind him and taking on the more adult-sounding name “Mark Jagger” instead. Wow! Welcome to adulthood, Mark! “Mick is a name for a little boy, and I’m an adult man. It’s time for me to be Mark,” the Rolling Stones frontman announced at a press conference earlier today. “The name Mick was cute for a while, but I’m 78 years old now, and I’ve completely outgrown it. I look forward to bringing you a far more mature and responsible version of the Rolling Stones under my new name of Mark Jagger.” Mark then went on to detail his vision for what he called “the grown-up version of our band.” In an attempt to bolster his new image as a responsible, hardworking adult, Mark will now come on stage at every Rolling Stones concert carrying a briefcase. He also noted that the briefcase will have pieces of paper with adult-sounding words like “Finance” and “Employment” written on them. This massive change will also have a huge effect on the Stones’ music, as Mark informed reporters that he has updated many classic Rolling Stones songs to reflect his new grown-up image. The song “Mother’s Little Helper” will now be called “Mother’s Full-Grown Assistant,” and the title of the song “Gimme Shelter” has now been changed to the more polite and mature “May I Please Have Some Shelter?” According to some Stones fans, Mark’s new adult image has already significantly changed the experience of seeing him perform live. “I saw the Stones in London recently, and Mark Jagger performed every song while sitting in a leather armchair and smoking a pipe,” said Percy Fleming, a lifelong fan of the band. “Toward the end of the concert, one of Mark Jagger’s bodyguards approached me and said, ‘Mark saw you in the audience and he thought you looked like a very responsible adult man. He’d like to invite you into his dressing after the show so that you can do his taxes for him.’” When pressed for details of his backstage liaison with Mark, Percy became a little coy. “I don’t want to be a gossip or anything,” he said with a sly smile, “but let’s just say his Roth IRA includes some very sensible investments.” This is so exciting! The Rolling Stones are already legends, but now it looks like they’re also ready to start acting like grownups by giving themselves sensible, adult names. Congrats to Mark Jagger for taking this big step and leaving his childish old name behind. We can’t wait to see what this iconic rockstar pulls off now that he’s finally decided to start acting his age!"
Major Dilemma: All 5 Of The Anti-Circumcision Conventions This Man Was Looking Forward To Attending Fall On The Same Weekend,N/A,https://clickhole.com/major-dilemma-all-5-of-the-anti-circumcision-conventions-this-man-was-looking-forward-to-attending-fall-on-the-same-weekend/,"If you’ve ever faced what felt like an impossible decision, you’re going to relate to this guy who is clearly stuck between a rock and hard place: All five of the anti-circumcision conventions this man was looking forward to attending fall on the same weekend. Woof. That’s a tough spot to be in! 38-year-old Carey Rhule has been getting ready for the anti-circumcision convention circuit all year, but in a terrible coincidence, all of the five conventions he was hoping to attend are scheduled for the same weekend in July. With each convention offering different, incomparable events, such as the the all-faith prayer circle for an end to circumcision at the Omaha, NE convention, or the “Regaining Your Manhood After It Was Nonconsensually Taken From You” seminar with sex psychologists in Washington D.C., it will be nearly impossible for him to choose. While Carey certainly has the option to try to travel between conferences so he can hit more than one, it may not be worth it. Although two conventions are in neighboring cities, with “Foreskin Is More-skin” in Saint Paul and “Sheath For America” in Minneapolis, choosing those conferences would mean that Carey couldn’t go to “Keep Your Swords Away From Ours” in Boston, which has the “Genital Integrity Ball” he bought a tux for back in January. Plus, leaving one conference to visit another would make it that much harder to form real bonds with that convention’s community of Genital Defenders, which is one of the major draws of attending one in the first place.  Wow. It totally sucks when something you were excited about doesn’t pan out the way you’d hoped. Fingers crossed that Carey can still figure out a way to have as many memorable anti-circumcision experiences as possible!"
Body Positivity FTW! Swift Transportation Just Hired The First Ever Plus-Size Truck Driver,N/A,https://clickhole.com/body-positivity-ftw-swift-transportation-just-hired-the-first-ever-plus-size-truck-driver/,"While the movement for mainstream acceptance of all body types has made major headway in the past few years, there is still work to be done. That’s why it’s so encouraging to see a company stepping up to the plate to bring change to an industry that has long excluded those with curvier builds: Swift Transportation just hired the first ever plus-size truck driver. Finally, a big-rig driver who looks like the rest of America! For as long as 18-wheelers have prowled the highways, the trucking industry has always been dominated by slim, chiseled drivers whose impressive physiques bear little semblance to those of ordinary Americans. That finally seems to be changing, though, with the hiring of 42-year-old Oscar Castillo. The 347-pound, two-pack-a-day smoker may not look anything like the trim, muscled adonises we’re used to seeing behind the wheel of a Peterbilt, but just because he doesn’t fit into the traditional trucker mold doesn’t mean he can’t push down on the gas pedal and move the wheel back and forth just as well as anyone else.  “My entire life I’ve wanted to drive a truck, but it just never seemed feasible because of my heavy build,” said Castillo. “The truckers I was used to seeing all had washboard abs and bulging pecs. I didn’t look anything like them, but I wasn’t going to let that stop me from pursuing my dream.” Several months ago, Castillo saw a flier advertising a truck driving course and decided to go for it. On his first day, the instructor took one disgusted look at him and asked him if he was in the right class. Hearing the snickers and whispers from his classmates about his size wasn’t easy, but he didn’t let it deter him, and three weeks later he completed the course and earned his commercial driver’s license.  Knowing he was up against long odds in a notoriously fat-phobic industry, Castillo applied for every single truck driving job he could find in hopes that someone—anyone!—might give him a shot. Luckily for him, a labor shortage had left many companies desperate for workers, and, much to his surprise, it wasn’t long before he heard back from a recruiter at Swift Transportation who was hiring regional trash haulers in Oakland City, Indiana. While Castillo certainly didn’t look the part, he had the necessary certification to drive semi trucks, and that was enough for Swift to go ahead and offer him his dream job—something that had never seemed possible for a man of his size. Awesome! Granted, Castillo’s hiring is still very much an anomaly in an industry largely ruled by size zeros. But big change starts with little victories, and this is nonetheless encouraging progress on the road towards body positivity in trucking. And now, with Castillo behind the wheel of a big rig, it’s only a matter of time before a chubby little boy greets him with a “trucker salute,” and when he sees Castillo’s large, jiggly arm reach up to pull the horn, he’ll say, “Hey, that guy kind of looks like me. And he’s a truck driver! Maybe I can be one too someday.” And that alone will make everything worth it."
Proof Of The Afterlife? This Man Just Heard His Deceased Father Yell ‘There Is An Afterlife!’ From Inside His Toilet,N/A,https://clickhole.com/proof-of-the-afterlife-this-man-just-heard-his-deceased-father-yell-there-is-an-afterlife-from-inside-his-toilet/,"Everyone has their own theory about what happens to us when we die, from living for eternity in Heaven to simply going out like a light, but there’s never been any hard proof one way or the other—that is, until now: This man just heard his dead dad yell, “There is an afterlife!” from inside his toilet.  Wow. Could this finally be indisputable evidence of life after death? When 36-year-old Michael Wormack lost his father in a car accident last month, it was the first time one of his immediate family members had passed, and he was overcome not only with grief over the loss of his father, but questions and fears about his own mortality. However, those questions were put to rest earlier today when he was using the bathroom and suddenly heard a strange gurgling sound coming from inside his toilet. At first he thought it was the pipes or something, but after hearing what sounded like a muffled human voice and putting his ear to the bowl to listen closer, he was shocked to hear the unmistakable voice of his father. “There is an afterlife!” his deceased father screamed in terror. “Please, son, listen to me! There is an afterlife, and it is horrible! I need your hel—” He was unable to finish conveying his message, as Michael panicked and flushed the toilet, cutting his dad off mid-sentence. But Michael heard enough of the tortured wailing to come away with some closure, knowing deep down that his dad is in fact still out there somewhere watching over him. And while it didn’t seem like his dad was in any sort of Heaven-type place, or even anywhere remotely pleasant, it nonetheless gave him peace of mind knowing that his spirit lives on.   How comforting! While the experience might’ve given Michael closure, it also raises a number of new questions.  Does everyone go on to live in their son’s toilet after they die, or just Michael’s father? Is it cold and wet down there? What does he eat? The answers to those questions may not yet be clear, but here’s hoping Michael encounters his dad in the toilet again in the future and is able to gain more insight into the Great Unknown."
Jesus Christ! There’s A Macaque In The Backseat!,N/A,https://clickhole.com/jesus-christ-theres-a-macaque-in-the-backseat/,"Everyone in this car right now, get ready to panic, because this is the scariest and most shocking story you’re going to hear all day: There’s currently a macaque in the backseat! What the fuck! Get it out! Get it out of here right now! We first became aware of the macaque in our car when a furry little hand reached out from underneath the back seat and grabbed a handful of chips out of the bag of Fritos that Justin was eating. Justin screamed and the macaque rocketed out from under the seat and started leaping all over the car, shrieking and baring its teeth at everyone in a threatening way. For the past five minutes everyone has been completely freaking out, doing their best to stay far away from the monkey as it explores the car and puts various small objects into its mouth. Holy shit holy shit holy shit! What are we going to do? We’re on the freeway right now, so we can’t exactly get out of the car. What if it bites us or steals our lunches? Okay, we’re going to try to open the window and see if the macaque leaps out…. Fuck, nope. It’s not working. The macaque clearly does not want to leap out of the window of a car currently driving 65 miles per hour. Fuck. Shit! It just ripped a hair clip right out of Lucy’s hair! No way she’s getting that back. The monkey is grabbing pretty much every shiny object it can get its gross little hands on and is making a little pile of them underneath the passenger seat. Jesus Christ…okay, what else can we do here? Hayley just found a paper shopping bag stuffed into the pocket behind the driver’s seat. She’s going to try to trap the monkey underneath it…. Careful now…careful, Hayley…easy now…. FUCK! Hayley brought the bag down on top of the macaque, and the fucking monkey tore through the top of it and straight-up slapped Hayley in the face! The monkey slapped Hayley! This situation is out of control! Even though Lucy is driving, she’s currently on her phone frantically skimming the “Macaque” Wikipedia article to see if it has a subsection called “Removal From Moving Cars.” Obviously it’s not ideal to have the person driving the car also browsing the internet, but this is a full-on emergency. It’s only a matter of time before the macaque starts biting people! Well, this situation just got even more dire. Hayley just Googled “are monkey bites poisonous,” and she says she can’t find anything online that explicitly says they’re not. And now Justin is taking off one of his boots to try to whack the macaque in hopes of knocking it out before it gets even more violent. But goddamn, it’s a fast little fucker! Every time Justin swings the boot at it, the hairy freak just easily leaps out of the way. It’s getting angry, too. One of us is going to get bitten. It’s just a matter of time…. Oh, great. The monkey is pissing now. Fan-fucking-tastic. The monkey is pissing, and it stinks.  Lucy’s on the phone with her mom asking her what she should do. Her mom just asked her if she keeps a gun in the glove compartment, and when Lucy said she didn’t, her mom said she was out of ideas and hung up. We are officially on our own here! Fuck! The macaque is chewing on the phone charger Lucy has plugged into the dashboard. Hayley tried to shoo it and the macaque slapped her hand away. FUCK! The monkey just bit Lucy because she tried to grab her hair clip back from the monkey’s pile of shiny objects. We knew this was bound to happen, and now it has. If this monkey is poisonous, she’s definitely going to need to go to the hospital. There’s no sugarcoating it. This car belongs to the macaque now. Lucy is pulling over to the shoulder and we’re just going to abandon the car here on the side of the freeway. We’ll walk to the nearest rest stop and hopefully at that point we can call the National Guard or something to deal with the monkey. Fuck. This is seriously the last thing we needed today."
A Piece Of History: The Convertible JFK Took On A Joyride To Dallas Figuring His Dad Would Never Find Out Is Coming To The Smithsonian,N/A,https://clickhole.com/a-piece-of-history-the-convertible-jfk-took-on-a-joyride-to-dallas-figuring-his-dad-would-never-find-out-is-coming-to-the-smithsonian/,"No American alive in 1963 can forget where they were when President John F. Kennedy was tragically shot and killed, putting a heartbreaking end to the epic day he’d spent playing hooky from work in downtown Dallas. But now, a central artifact from that fateful event will be available for the public to view: The convertible JFK took on a joyride to Dallas figuring his dad would never find out is coming to the Smithsonian. Wow. What an incredible opportunity to relive one of the most monumental moments in U.S. history. The interactive exhibit coming to the National Museum of American History museum next month will allow visitors to immerse themselves in the timeline of the unforgettable November Friday when the then-president cleverly warmed his face with a hot towel to fake a fever and stay home, then waited for his father Joseph P. Kennedy to leave for work before stealing his Ferrari convertible from the garage. Smithsonian curators have meticulously recreated the timeline of the day, from the moment Kennedy convinced his best friend Lyndon Johnson to cut work with him, to the madcap adventure they had sneaking into a Dallas Cowboys game and eating their weight in stadium junk food. The exhibit will even feature an exact transcript of the sneaky phone call Johnson made to bust Jackie Onassis, Kennedy’s girlfriend, out of an obligatory lunch date, claiming that he was an emergency room doctor attending to Jackie’s mother, Janet Bouvier, who was urgently sick with appendicitis. Fascinatingly, the Smithsonian has arranged the exhibit so that viewers can also trace a parallel timeline detailing the day from the perspective of the disgruntled Lee Harvey Oswald, who was tasked by Kennedy’s chief of staff with hauling the three slackers back to the White House. A map allows museum patrons to experience the zig-zagging, obstacle-filled route that Oswald took while chasing Kennedy, Johnson, and Onassis all over town, the truants evading capture at every turn. But the crown jewel of the exhibit comes when the two timelines converge midday at Dealey Plaza in Dallas. Here, museum-goers can look at the blood-spattered convertible in person while listening to a recording describing the moment when Oswald discovered Kennedy dancing wildly atop his car to “Twist And Shout,” and fired at the marauding President three times, killing him instantly in a moment that would change the course of the nation forever. What an extraordinary exhibit! There is so much to be learned from this immersive narrative of one of the most shocking, tragic, and sometimes even funny days in American history. We honestly can’t wait to visit the National Museum of American History, because this seems like an opportunity not to be missed."
"Incredibly Heroic: When Flight Attendants Announced That An Airplane Passenger Was Suffering From Severe Lack Of Self-Belief, This Incredible Life Coach Stepped Up To Save The Day",N/A,https://clickhole.com/incredibly-heroic-when-flight-attendants-announced-that-an-airplane-passenger-was-suffering-from-severe-lack-of-self-belief-this-incredible-life-coach-stepped-up-to-save-the-day/,"Nothing is more terrifying than going through an emergency while flying on a plane 30,000 feet in the air, but this story of a near-disaster in the skies has a happy ending: When flight attendants announced that a passenger on their plane was suffering from a severe lack of self-belief, this incredible life coach stepped up to save the day. Wow. It’s just so lucky that she was there to help! All was well an hour into American Airlines flight 1067 to Dallas when suddenly, flight attendants made an urgent announcement that a passenger on the plane was suffering from an acute crisis of confidence and needed immediate professional assistance. They called for any life coaches, therapists, or even just people with basic pep talk skills to come to the front of plane and thankfully, Shelley David, a Dallas-area certified life coach specializing in work-life balance and banishing the inner critic, jumped to her feet without a second thought. When she arrived at passenger Neil Walden’s seat, the situation was dire. Shelley immediately saw that Neil, whose laptop was open to a legal brief for work, was exhibiting signs of severe uncertainty and low self esteem: He was hitting the backspace key repeatedly, smacking his forehead with his palm in frustration, and muttering “you idiot” to himself under his breath. Neil’s loved ones were terrified, but Shelley quickly took control of the situation by performing a quick “3-3-3” confidence boost session, asking Neil to list three positive qualities of his, three people in his life who cared about him, and three accomplishments from the past that he was proud of. So heroic! After Shelley’s initial intervention, Neil ceased angrily scrolling through his document and repeating, “Oh God, they’re going to fire me,” but he wasn’t out of the woods yet—Shelley had to act quickly to take a full inventory of Neil’s limiting beliefs about himself, eventually determining that the root cause of his symptoms was a deep-seated fear that his intelligence was not up to par with that of his coworkers. Having ascertained the cause of the episode, Shelley was able to lead Neil in a series of emergency affirmations, and his heart rate slowed while he and Shelley repeated the phrases “I am valuable. I am enough. I can do anything.” The flight attendants let Shelley know that pilots were prepared to make an emergency landing to get Neil to a Personal Wellness And Self-Esteem retreat, but Shelley barely blinked: Instead she grabbed a used Dasani bottle from the beverage cart and crushed it up into a makeshift ball for her “CATCH Some Self Love!” exercise, during which she asked Neil to say something he liked about himself every time she tossed him the ball. After ten less-than-fruitful tosses, Shelley was able to get Neil to admit that even though he was struggling with this particular work assignment, he knew deep down that he was a valuable employee and person. When he finally took a deep breath and uttered the words “I’m not a failure. I matter,” the entire plane rose to their feet and cheered with a combination of joy and pure relief. We are so thankful to Shelley David for stepping up when her skills were needed and helping avert what could have been a gruesome self confidence disaster. The world needs more people like Shelley! What a hero!"
Almost Heartwarming: This Old Couple Died Within Minutes Of Each Other After 70 Years Of Marriage But The Guy Spent Those Minutes Trying Like Hell To Get Back Out There,N/A,https://clickhole.com/almost-heartwarming-this-old-couple-died-within-minutes-of-each-other-after-70-years-of-marriage-but-the-guy-spent-those-minutes-trying-like-hell-to-get-back-out-there/,"Every now and then you see a story that reminds you how deep and devoted true love can be, and one couple came within inches of being that story before somebody went and blew it: This old couple died within minutes of each other after 70 years of marriage but the guy spent those minutes trying like hell to get back out there. Ah, damn. Could’ve been incredibly heartwarming if he’d just kept it in his pants. Upon winding up in adjacent hospital beds after 70 years of steadfast and unwavering marriage, 91-year-old Edna Talbotson turned to her husband Tom to whisper “Thank you, my darling, for our lives together. I love you, now and always,” before quietly departing this world, and it would have been a truly affecting moment if Tom hadn’t followed it up by immediately popping his wedding ring off and announcing, “I am single and ready to wet my dingle!” to everyone within earshot while clumsily gyrating his hips and making lewd pinching gestures. We’d honestly kind of hoped Tom would just close his eyes and slip away to join his beloved Edna in the afterlife, but nope, he shouted across the still warm body of the woman he’d earlier that day called “the other half of my very being” to ask the nurse checking for Edna’s non-existent pulse, “Hey gorgeous, you ever tug a pud that served in Korea?” And when that failed, he furiously mashed his bed’s nurse call button to request a “Viagra drip” while continuing to catcall everyone who walked past his door.  It’s hard to convey just how single-mindedly Tom attempted to get pussy in those 15 minutes between his wife’s death and his own. When a different nurse asked him if he’d like a moment to be alone with the body of the woman who bore him four children and stood by him through two bouts with cancer and the untimely death of their oldest son, Tom just licked his lips and professed that the only body he wanted to be alone with was that nurse’s own, adding that she should “go ahead and roll the old bat down to the morgue” and then “come back to do an exam on my tubesteak,” which he noted had experienced “unusual growth” ever since she entered the room. He also silenced multiple incoming calls from his daughter desperately trying to exchange last goodbyes with her dying parents to search “LOCAL SEX OPPORTUNTIES” and “DOMINICAN PROSTITUTE FOR HIRE” on his phone. Even Tom’s seemingly innocent request to eat a final bowl of his and Edna’s favorite mint chocolate chip ice cream, which could have been an endearing tribute to the many simple evenings they spent wordlessly cherishing each other’s company, was marred by his further explanation that he’d need the calories to give him energy for all “the screwing and smooching and pinching” he planned on doing.  Then, moments later while yelling at passersby out the window about how they should come give his “schmuck a suck,” Tom’s heart finally gave out, and as much as we’d wanted to imagine Edna warmly greeting him in Heaven and taking his hand to venture gladly forth into eternity together, there’s just no way that’s still on the table after his brief but vigorous attempt to get his nonagenarian dick wet. We really would have thought “till death do us part” implied a short grace period afterward, but Tom apparently took that line of his vows as a hard cutoff, and at this point no amount of tender affection shared between the couple over seven decades can make up for that final image of Tom expressing his eagerness to eat pussy “like a starved dog behind a deli counter” while a nurse somberly closed Edna’s eyelids forever five feet to his left. We’d really be choking back the tears if Tom had just gone ahead and died before getting up to all this, but alas, no dice. He took what was very, very nearly an uplifting testament to the enduring power of love and turned it into an upsetting pageant of elderly lust, using his final breaths to make everyone around him uncomfortable with his out-of-control horniness. Here’s hoping the next heartwarming elderly couple we find doesn’t fuck things up so badly in the home stretch! "
‘I Put A Crouton In My Anus And Let A Chameleon Snatch It From My Anus With Its Projectile Tongue And I Found It Quite Thrilling’: Benedict Cumberbatch Just Announced That He Did That And That He Understands If No One Wants To Work With Him Anymore But It Doesn’t Bother Him Because He’s Found Something That Makes Him Happy ,N/A,https://clickhole.com/i-put-a-crouton-in-my-anus-and-let-a-chameleon-snatch-it-from-my-anus-with-its-projectile-tongue-and-i-found-it-quite-thrilling-benedict-cumberbatch-just-announced-that-he-did-that/,"Learning to love yourself for who you are is one of the most liberating things you can do, and one of Hollywood’s biggest stars just opened up about his journey to self-acceptance in a truly inspiring way: Benedict Cumberbatch has announced that he put a crouton in his anus and let a chameleon snatch it (from his anus) with its projectile tongue, and that he found it quite thrilling, and that he understands if no one wants to work with him anymore but it doesn’t bother him because he’s found something that makes him happy.  Looks like Benedict has found his thing! Good for him! The Sherlock star announced the news at a press conference earlier this morning, explaining to a small crowd of reporters how he ordered a chameleon online from Africa and when it arrived in the mail he felt the instinct to remove his pants and insert a garlic crouton halfway into his anus and turn his exposed anus towards the chameleon he ordered online, so he did that, and then when he did that the chameleon’s tongue launched out of its mouth and snatched the crouton from his anus, and when that happened Cumberbatch felt a wonderful tickling sensation go through his body that made him feel truly, deeply happy, so much so that he doesn’t even care if his behavior gets him blacklisted in Hollywood, as that would just give him more time do do what he loves most, which, it turns out, is inserting a crouton into his anus and letting a chameleon use its tongue to yank the crouton free. “I did do that, and I’m not afraid about what it means for me professionally because it brings me a joy none of you will ever understand and I’m going to keep doing it for the rest of my life whether I am starring in major motion pictures or not, so go ahead and give my role as Dr. Strange to someone else if you want, because it won’t bother me as long as I have a bag of croutons and a chameleon capable of grabbing the croutons from my anus on hand at all times,” Cumberbatch proudly declared. “If you’ve ever been on a roller coaster or taken ecstasy or experienced runner’s high, those experiences are in the same ballpark of how I feel when the chameleon’s tongue plucks away the crouton that I tucked inside my bare anus, and to be clear, immediately after this press conference I am going to go home and do this over and over until I run out of croutons, and if the chameleon gets too full to continue, then I will order more chameleons from Africa so I never have to stop doing this thing that brings me more happiness than any person or activity I have ever known.” Own it, Benedict! Don’t let anyone shame you for being yourself! While it’s still yet to be seen whether Cumberbatch’s courageous announcement will result in any personal or professional consequences, here’s hoping people are open-minded enough to respect his freedom to live his life however he pleases, even if it doesn’t necessarily align with traditional societal norms. If it makes him feel fulfilled and he’s not harming anyone, then more power to him. You do you, Benedict!"
Adventure Awaits! The US Forest Service Has Hidden A Rolo Somewhere In America’s Forests To Encourage Kids To Get Out And Explore The Outdoors,N/A,https://clickhole.com/adventure-awaits-the-us-forest-service-has-hidden-a-rolo-somewhere-in-americas-forests-to-encourage-kids-to-get-out-and-explore-the-outdoors/,"The days of kids playing outside ‘til sundown have long been a thing of the past, with children in recent decades gravitating more and more towards phones, video games, and social media to occupy their free time. As a result, kids have been losing touch with nature, but thankfully a major initiative is underway to get young people back into the great outdoors: The U.S. Forest Service has hidden a single Rolo somewhere in America’s forests for anyone to claim.  Awesome! Let’s get kids off the couch and back into nature! The U.S. Forest Service’s official Facebook page announced the treasure hunt earlier today with a post reading, “193 million acres. One delicious Rolo. Zero clues. Get out there and #findtherolo!” It included an image of a single unwrapped Rolo sitting amidst moss and leaves in an unspecified forest somewhere in the continental U.S. The Rolo, still looking delicious and completely undisturbed by insects and wildlife, is sure to inspire thousands of kids nationwide to trek out into remote, rugged terrain with no cell coverage or access to clean drinking water in hopes of being the lucky one who finds the chocolatey treat. Based on the comments the post has generated, plenty of eager adventurers are already heading out Rolo-hunting expeditions. One child commented, “The Rolo looks good. There’s some national forest land 200 miles from my house. I’ll see if my dad will drop me off after school on Friday.” Another child posted a selfie of himself loaded up with a massive pack and a canister of bear spray on his hip with the comment, “Any way of narrowing down where the Rolo is based on topography, type of forest, climate, etc?” to which the Forest Service replied, “No.”  So cool!  While the vast majority of the kids who head out into the woods won’t be lucky enough to actually find the Rolo, and some unfortunate explorers might get injured or even die due to a lack of survival skills, the fact is that everyone who chooses to embark on this adventure will come away with a deep appreciation of nature—a reward more valuable than all the Rolos in the world. And with our planet in peril, we need the next generation to care about protecting nature, and there’s no doubt that searching for a single Rolo hidden somewhere in America’s 193 million acres of federal forest land will turn countless young people into passionate naturalists. Kudos to the U.S. Forest Service for motivating our nation’s kids to spend less time with their phones and more time with Mother Nature."
Queen For A Day! Everyone Has To Help This Girl Carry Her Backpack Because Her Wrist Is In An Ace Bandage From Tripping At Recess,N/A,https://clickhole.com/queen-for-a-day-everyone-has-to-help-this-girl-carry-her-backpack-because-her-wrist-is-in-an-ace-bandage-from-tripping-at-recess/,"Watch out, because as of today there’s a new queen in town, and Her Royal Highness requires the unwavering support of all her loyal subjects: Everyone has to help this girl carry her backpack because her wrist is in an Ace bandage from tripping at recess. At your service, Your Majesty! Nine-year-old Hayleigh Martin may have walked into Woodhaven Elementary this morning as a regular student, but that changed as soon as she tripped and fell on the blacktop during a game of knockout, twisting her wrist in such a way that she had to be accompanied by a retinue of her three best friends to the nurse’s office. There, her royal transformation took place: The nurse wrapped Hayleigh’s twisted wrist in a supportive elastic bandage and decreed that she should “be careful not to bump it,” thus conferring such noble power on Hayleigh that two of her three friends literally held her arm in place while the third carried her backpack for her as they walked back to recess. When class began, word of Hayleigh’s august station spread quickly: Ms. Evans asked Dominic, who sat next to Hayleigh, to pull out her chair to ensure she did not overstress the injured joint,  and four different classmates took turns holding her lunchbox on the way to the cafeteria so that Hayleigh could proceed unencumbered. Then, when Hayleigh raised her hand during social studies to let Ms. Evans know that her wrist was starting to feel tingly, Her Majesty was not only allowed to sit in the beanbag chair at the back of class reserved for reading time, but she also got to have Eliza accompany her to the back with her social studies folder and help her take notes even though her injury was not, in fact, on her dominant hand. The enormous ice pack the nurse had given Hayleigh was dripping and lukewarm by this time, but Eliza still saw to it that it was pressed against Her Excellency’s wrist to ensure maximum comfort. At the end of the school day, Hayleigh was escorted out to the bus pickup area by an entourage of her classmates, who bravely protected their sovereign ruler from any troublesome kindergarteners who might try to poke at or headbutt her arm. By the time the bus came, Hayleigh’s bandage was dangling halfway off her arm, and she seemed to be playing Miss Mary Mack two-handed with no issue, so we’ll see if she retains her privileged status tomorrow, or if the injury is sufficiently healed and she returns to school good as new. Regardless, we are ready and willing to serve however we are asked. Long live Hayleigh!"
What’s The Fucking Angle Here: This Kid Is Walking Around And Passing Worksheets Out To The Whole Classroom Even Though The Teacher Said To Just Pass Them Straight Back,N/A,https://clickhole.com/whats-the-fucking-angle-here-this-kid-is-walking-around-and-passing-worksheets-out-to-the-whole-classroom-even-though-the-teacher-said-to-just-pass-them-straight-back/,"If you happen to be at McCarty Elementary School right now, there’s a good chance you’re scratching your head in confusion, because one fourth-grader is doing something truly baffling for reasons that aren’t clear: This kid is walking around and passing worksheets out to the whole classroom even though the teacher said to just pass them straight back. Okay, what’s the fucking angle here, kid? What are you trying to pull? When Mrs. Bayer announced to her class that it was time to do a fractions worksheet, she handed the pile of papers to student Ryan Gibbons and asked him to take one and pass it on. Yet for whatever reason, rather than heed her instructions, Ryan instantly got up from his desk and began walking around the room, passing out the assignments to his classmates one by one. It’s not really clear why passing the pile back to the kid behind him wasn’t enough involvement for Ryan, but apparently it wasn’t, because he is beaming with pride as he slowly makes his way down each row of desks, saying “here you go” to each student as he personally hands them their math assignment. Huh. Go figure. It’s definitely not out of the ordinary for Ryan to pull this type of shit. He’s not a teacher’s pet per se, but he for some reason is always eager to pitch in on random classroom maintenance tasks like helping clean the chalkboard or watering the class aloe plant or pointing out when it’s time to leave for lunch. It’s as if he thinks he has some kind of middle-management role in his fourth grade class, but where he got that idea, no one knows. Maybe Ryan is finally making a bid to become an official teacher’s helper with this passing-out-papers gambit, because he just announced “Everyone got one!” as he handed the extra papers back to Mrs. Bayer, who was not even paying attention to him to begin with. All she said was “Ryan, go find your seat,” as if he hadn’t done anything at all. No one even really wants to do this worksheet, so it’s not as though all of Ryan’s classmates appreciate him making this a whole thing. Whatever Ryan’s endgame was, let’s hope he achieved it, because everyone around him has pretty much moved on. Now Ryan is back in his seat and is already trying to answer some questions on the worksheet while Mrs. Bayer is still explaining the instructions. He seems to think there is something to be gained by putting all this energy into the way he behaves at school, but it does not seem as though there is. No one really cares, Ryan. Sorry, bud."
They Fucking Did It. The Crazy Fucking Bastards Did It: Wells Fargo Has Introduced A Flexible Checking Account That Works With Your Changing Needs,N/A,https://clickhole.com/they-fucking-did-it-the-crazy-fucking-bastards-did-it-wells-fargo-has-introduced-a-flexible-checking-account-that-works-with-your-changing-needs/,"People said it was impossible. People said they’d lost their minds. But after years of being scoffed at, ridiculed, and dismissed as reckless dreamers, they’ve achieved what no one believed they could: Wells Fargo has introduced a flexible checking account that works with your changing needs.  Incredible! Those crazy fucking bastards actually pulled it off! What kind of dangerous foolishness drove the maniacs at Wells Fargo to believe that a checking account could come with low monthly fees and overdraft forgiveness while at the same time offering the flexibility to spend points your way? Who the fuck knows. But that’s exactly what they set out to do. They didn’t know how they were going to do it, they just knew it had to be done somehow, someway. And come hell or high water, they were going to see it through—even if no one else believed in them.  When word got out that Wells Fargo, the roughest, wildest group of bankers this side of Canada, had set out to introduce a checking account that grows as you do, they were the laughingstock of the entire banking industry. Wells Fargo? Succeeding where the big boys like JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, and Bank of America had failed? Not a snowball’s chance in hell. How, exactly, did such a ragtag crew of underdog bankers create a financial product that provides the ease and convenience of a personal checking account but with the powerful money-management tools normally reserved for business checking? By combining the benefits of their award-winning SelectPlus Checking with the best features of their popular Wells Perks program and putting it all at your fingertips in the Wells Go app so you never miss any of life’s important moments, that’s fucking how.  After countless sleepless nights of hard work, steely eyed resolve, and more than a little bit of that crazy Wells magic, the determined madmen at Wells Fargo soldiered through to introduce Wells Fargo FlexCheck checking. Sometimes, when you fly too close to the sun you get burned…but then sometimes, you come back with a versatile checking account that allows you to switch between three distinct settings to suit your changing needs free of charge.  Unreal. Never in a million years did people believe this could actually happen.  Some of the world’s greatest innovators have been written off as nutjobs only to be vindicated by doing the unthinkable. Add Wells Fargo to that list. We’ll admit, as much as we’ve always respected Wells Fargo for their wildly out-there ideas and inspiring-but-naive optimism, we didn’t have faith they were going to be able to pull this one off either. Seamlessly integrating their most popular banking products into a single checking account solution that meets all your checking needs? It seemed like a pipe dream. But we’ll gladly eat crow on this one, Wells Fargo. You did it. You crazy fucking bastards actually did it, and we’ll never doubt you again."
Who Greenlit This? ‘To Catch A Predator’ Is Getting A Spinoff Called ‘To Catch A Fish’ Where Chris Hansen Goes Fishing With Pedophiles,N/A,https://clickhole.com/who-greenlit-this-to-catch-a-predator-is-getting-a-spinoff-called-to-catch-a-fish-where-chris-hansen-goes-fishing-with-pedophiles/,"There’s no shortage of tasteless programming on TV these days, but it looks like NBC just took things to a whole new level: To Catch A Predator is getting a spinoff called To Catch A Fish where Chris Hansen goes fishing with pedophiles. Fishing with pedophiles?!? Are you freaking serious? Whoever came up with this needs God in their life! NBC announced the crass new addition to its programming slate earlier today, describing To Catch A Fish as a travel show where “Chris Hansen combines his two passions, fishing and pedophiles, as he and registered sex offenders put aside their differences to talk about life and cast lines in America’s most scenic beaches, rivers, and lakes.” According to NBC, the show will acknowledge that the guests are pedophiles at the beginning of each episode, but beyond that there will be no mention of their crimes or attraction to minors whatsoever. Instead, the program will focus on the deep conversations between the former Dateline journalist and his deviant guests, in which they share stories from their past and discuss lessons they’ve learned through adulthood, with any mentions of sex crimes being completely incidental. Marketing materials for the program prominently feature an image of Hansen and a pedophile standing on a pontoon boat in waders, proudly holding up a largemouth bass together, accompanied by the show’s tagline: “I’m Chris Hansen. Why Don’t You Have A Seat…On My Boat?” NBC also revealed that Jon Batiste, Grammy-winning bandleader for The Late Show With Stephen Colbert, is signed to produce music for the show.  Additionally, NBC released a short teaser trailer for the program featuring footage from an episode shot in Lake Tahoe, CA, where Chris Hansen reels in trout and drinks beer with Kevin A. Gugliotta, a 53 year-old pedophile who served 12 years in a Pennsylvania prison for possession and distribution of child pornography. At one point in the clip, Gugliotta discloses an experience he had going door-to-door in his neighborhood to inform people of his criminal history. Hansen then hands Gugliotta a Coors Banquet from a cooler and says with a chuckle, “that may be the case in your neighborhood, but out here, in all this natural beauty, all that matters is if you can fish—and also if you have enough cold ones to last you through the day.”  Who in the hell greenlit this?!?   We honestly have no words right now. To Catch A Fish shows just how low the TV industry is willing to go for ratings, and we could not be more disgusted. Chris Hansen should be putting pedophiles behind bars, not going on beautiful fishing expeditions around the country with them. Here’s hoping the American people will do the right thing and refuse to tune in."
"Well, This Is Pretty Much The Worst: Looks Like You’re Going To Have To Talk To Someone In Order To Accomplish The Thing You’re Trying To Get Done",N/A,https://clickhole.com/well-this-is-pretty-much-the-worst-looks-like-youre-going-to-have-to-talk-to-someone-in-order-to-accomplish-the-thing-youre-trying-to-get-done/,"Well, this isn’t good. This isn’t good at all. You tried absolutely everything in your power to avoid this outcome, but unfortunately at this point it’s pretty much inevitable: It looks like you’re going to have to actually talk to someone in order to accomplish the thing you’re trying to get done.  God, what a fucking nightmare. While you were initially confident you were going to be able to go online and reschedule the delivery of an important package, that didn’t end up working, and now you’re facing the terrifying prospect of having to actually walk into a place, go up to a person, and talk to that person so they’ll fix your problem. Soon, you’ll be waiting in line at a crowded-but-deathly-quiet post office nervously checking your pocket to make sure you brought the little card with your package info on it, and then, once you reach the front of the line, you’ll struggle to not say anything dumb while explaining your situation to a stone-faced employee who, given the somewhat complicated nature of your issue, will probably have to ask you a series of follow-up questions that will almost certainly catch you off guard and leave you stammering as you struggle to formulate competent responses, keenly aware that if you don’t give them the correct information, they’ll be unable to assist you and will probably ask you to come back with the correct information at a different time, forcing you to repeat the whole nightmare all over again. Speaking to a person face to face in order to do something? How is this still happening in the year 2022?  Despite having decades of experience deftly avoiding interacting with actual human beings, it would appear your best efforts have completely failed. You’ve entered the code on the card your mail carrier left in your mailbox on the post office’s website at least 30 times, but it keeps saying “No records found.” You’ve tracked the package dozens of times and it claims it’s been “out for delivery” for the past five days. You even tried signing the card (even though there was no signature box) and leaving it in your mailbox, but your carrier just left it there and put your new mail on top of it.  Normally, the nuclear option for dealing with problems like this which can’t be handled by chatbot, email, or Google is to pick up the phone and hope there’s some sort of automated procedure for handling it, but you’ve called, like, six different post office numbers and they all go to the same menu. During one of your calls, an actual human unexpectedly picked up, which gave you a small taste of the punishment to come. The overwhelming shock of hearing a real human on the other end of the call led you to immediately hang up because you’d had no time to prepare by repeating your question over and over again in your head so you wouldn’t fuck it up, plus you couldn’t understand what they said when they answered so you weren’t sure how to respond without sounding like an idiot.  Finally, unable to sleep due to images of yourself at the post office faking a smile and attempting to describe your petty problem to someone who could not possibly be less interested in helping you, you even went through the trouble of writing a lengthy post on Reddit in r/mail explaining every nuanced detail of your problem before asking, “Anyone ever had any luck handling a similar situation without having to actually go into the post office?” Upon checking the thread in the morning, your heart sunk even further upon seeing that of four responses, three suggested you were going to have to go into the post office, and one just said, “What’s in the package that’s so important you wrote a 6 paragraph post about it at 1:30 AM on a Tuesday?”  Just awful. You are literally sick to your stomach with stress over this. The past couple years of pandemic life had really given you hope that the days of face-to-face customer-employee interaction were a thing of the past, but apparently your optimism was unfounded. This situation has turned into an absolute shitshow, and if you hadn’t already invested so much time and money into it, you’d almost certainly just throw in the towel and cut your losses. Fuck. Guess you’re gonna have to learn to live in a world where you sometimes have to talk to other human beings, even though it’s the literal worst."
The Darkest Hour Comes Just Before The Dawn: SeatGeek Says There Are No Current Or Upcoming Events For Daughtry in The Greater Chicago Area,N/A,https://clickhole.com/the-darkest-hour-comes-just-before-the-dawn-seatgeek-says-there-are-no-current-or-upcoming-events-for-daughtry-in-the-greater-chicago-area/,"In times of total despair, the bravest course of action one can take is to continue onward, in spite of the odds. And it looks like now is such a time: SeatGeek says there are no current or upcoming events for Daughtry in the greater Chicago area.  Do not lose hope—you’ll need as much of it as you can to make it through this dire season. The results of your Google search for “chris daughtry concert chicago” may as well have been the image a dead tree in a barren field, as SeatGeek delivered the gutting news that American Idol fourth place runner-up Chris Daughtry has no set dates to perform in Chicago, nor the surrounding metropolitan area, in either the immediate or distant future. And with this devastating pronouncement, so began the darkest night of the soul for any Chicagoan hoping to witness Daughtry perform within a hundred-mile radius anytime soon. As heart-wrenching as this may be for residents of the City of Big Shoulders, they should not rend their garments in despair but rather cling to their faith more than ever, for it takes but a lucky stroke of fate or a last-minute announcement of a co-headlining show with Sevendust at the House Of Blues to wrest one out of the depths of sorrow and into the cool waters of good fortune. Our greatest trials precede our greatest triumphs, and only those who do not waver in their resolve will know the full joys of seeing Daughtry in all his glorious baldness when he does finally choose to bless the people of the Windy City with a rock ‘n’ roll performance. As God tested Job, Daughtry now tests you, Chicago.  Do not give in to the darkness, Daughtry fans who live in Chicago proper or any of the surrounding suburbs, such as Naperville or Berwyn. It is true, yes, that Daughtry will not be bringing his Kid’s Choice Award-nominated melodies to the Second City for many fortnights, but musicians increasingly rely on touring for revenue, and sure as the sun does rise over the Dan Ryan Expressway, so Daughtry will appear again for the corn-fed Illinoisans who love him so. Forge ahead towards the distant light and trust that it will one day deliver you from the Daughtry-free blackness through which you presently stagger. Onward, all ye Daughtry disciples of Chicagoland!"
"Tomorrow We May Die, So Tonight, We Live Well: This Man Just Rotated In A Fresh Pair Of Earplugs Before Going To Bed",N/A,https://clickhole.com/tomorrow-we-may-die-so-tonight-we-live-well-this-man-just-rotated-in-a-fresh-pair-of-earplugs-before-going-to-bed/,"The future is ever fraught with peril, and in the face of such uncertainty, all we wretched pawns of fate may do is fully live every moment as though it may be our last: This man just rotated in a fresh pair of earplugs before going to bed. If indeed these be our final hours on earth, let them be without regret! One day, we all must die. Perhaps soon, perhaps a great many years from now. But should death find Noah Sampson tomorrow, he may greet it with open arms, for tonight he is casting aside his current gunked-up pair of nighttime earplugs to enjoy the incomparable worldly comforts of a fresh pair in their stead. Tonight, he says no to the accumulation of several days’ worth of wax, and yes to those divine joys to which only a living body may serve as vessel. And though a carbon monoxide leak or inexperienced city bus driver may indeed pluck the breath from his breast once the sun rises on the morn, nothing in this world or the next can take from him the singular bliss of the yet untarnished, pristine foam plugs that rest inside his ear canals tonight. Could Sampson have gotten another night out of the old pair? Aye, he could have, as surely as he could have supped on rotten mutton and washed it down with stale water from a ditch. We all may choose to live our lives so meekly and without pleasure that death should seem an improvement of our lot. But shall we? Shall we simply brook the itchiness of an old pair of earplugs, their uncomfortable vague dampness, the slightly increased time it takes for them to expand and form a tight, noise-blocking seal? Turn now to Sampson’s beatific smile as he lays freshly plugged ear upon pillow, and see how he answers: No. NO. NO! We shall seize the pleasures of life gladly and with heedless abandon, leaving cowards to squander their days rationing earplugs while we exult in the raptures of a fresh pair as kings! Come, ye dangerously slippery bathroom floors, ye unexpected adverse interactions between our allergy medicines and SSRIs, ye salmonella outbreaks from Hormel Turkey Pepperonis packaged in Beloit, Wisconsin between November and March! Come and do your very worst to still our beating hearts upon the new day, for having lived so tonight, our spirits may never die! Whatever lies ahead, tonight is yours, dear Sampson. May the relish with which you enjoyed your new earplugs echo forth into eternity as legend."
Bravo! This Subway Masturbator Is Jerking Himself Off Way Too Impressively For Anyone To Be Disgusted By It,N/A,https://clickhole.com/bravo-this-subway-mastubator-is-jerking-himself-off-way-too-impressively-for-anyone-to-be-disgusted-by-it/,"Sometimes true beauty is hiding in plain sight in our everyday lives. Something awe-inspiring and gorgeous might pop up in the middle of an otherwise dull day and take your breath away. Case in point: This subway masturbator is jerking himself off way too impressively for anyone to be disgusted by it. Bravo, sir! Your elegant display of public onanism has captured the hearts and minds of all your fellow subway passengers! When the man first began masturbating on the subway, most of the other people in the train car instinctively looked away, fearing it would be crude and unpleasant to witness. Yet within moments, it became apparent that this man was a maestro in the art of self pleasure. He jerked himself off with elegant, rhythmic arm motions, his eyes wide and unblinking as if enchanted by beatific visions unfolding just beyond the ken of ordinary sight. An impressed murmur passed swiftly through the crowd of subway riders, and soon all eyes were on the subway masturbator and his magnificent, knee-trembling performance. “When the guy first started jacking off, my first instinct was to look away and switch to another car at the next stop, but honestly, the soulful way he was mashing his junk roused in me a latent, half-forgotten joy from deep in my soul, and I couldn’t bear to avert my eyes,” said subway passenger Greg Poznanski, choking up as he recalled the breathtaking scene of the man slapping his gland before a hushed audience of fellow commuters. “Watching that guy scrubbing off right in the middle of rush hour was like watching a masterful ballet: a perfect marriage of fluid motion and rigid discipline, an act of self-expression whose eloquence is enhanced, rather than stifled, by constraints of rhythm and form.” At one point the subway masturbator let out a deep-throated scream as he clapped away at his groin, a dramatic flourish which caused the other people on the train to gasp in astonishment. The man then stood up and started gyrating his hips while masturbating with one hand and using his other hand to flip the middle finger to nobody in particular, an act so mesmerizing and skillfully executed that it caused his rapt audience to rise from their seats and give him a standing ovation. As the train continued along its route, commuters waiting on the platform began to shove and bat at each other in an attempt to get into the masturbator’s car so that they could watch him expertly tug his pud. Like Yo-Yo Ma bowing a Stradivarius, the man passionately played his tumescent member with deft motions of the hand and wrist that showcased a level of virtuosic skill not only unpossessed, but plainly unattainable, by all those fortunate enough to witness it. “The guy was beating off quickly and slowly, loudly and quietly—it was like watching a new form of poetry being born before our very eyes,” said subway passenger Nancy Boyd, her eyes twinkling as she described the stirring sight of the man tenderly buttering his worm. “At one point the subway got to my stop, but I stayed on the train and kept riding just to keep watching him jerk it.” “The brave Ulysses was fortunate indeed that he had only to contend with the minor bewitchment of the siren’s song as he sailed homeward to Ithaca,” Boyd added, “For had that wily wanderer been tempted by the Olympian vision of this man tracing ghostly new geometries through the air as he throttled his boner, surely the urge to reorient his ship toward this dazzling wank would be too strong to resist, and he would have undoubtedly run his vessel aground on the unforgiving rocks.” After holding his audience in thrall for nearly 15 minutes, the subway masturbator abruptly muttered the word “Done” and sat back down, his hand and wrist finally still. Some passengers yelled, “Brava!” while others yelled, “Encore!” But most were simply reduced to the stupefied silence of one for whom the enigmatic resplendence of the sublime has confounded all words, all utterances, entirely. It was the kind of moment that reminds us that while humankind possesses the capacity for atrocious acts of cruelty and destruction, it possesses in equal measure the capacity to create moments of transcendent beauty. Some create this beauty through art, others through song, others by walking onto a crowded subway and grabbing their penis in front of dozens of unsuspecting travelers.  So allow us a moment to editorialize rhapsodically and implore all our readers to venture out into the world while you still can, for that is where you will find the hidden moments of majesty lying in wait behind the veil of the seemingly quotidian. All you need to do is board the train and embrace what awaits you!"
Major Red Flag: This Man’s Bookshelf Has A Big Bug On It,N/A,https://clickhole.com/major-red-flag-this-mans-bookshelf-has-a-big-bug-on-it/,"There’s no bigger letdown than discovering red flags about a prospective lover after you’ve connected with them on a date, especially when it’s something as unflattering as this: This man’s bookshelf has a big bug on it.  If you go home with a guy and he’s got an above average-sized insect scuttling around his bookshelf? Girl, run. Though Phoenix, AZ resident Jonathan Wheeler, 27, may come off as a charming and well-put-together guy, any date that goes home with him is in for an alarming surprise: a pretty fat bug—like, one you’d find in a desert or Madagascar or something—making itself at home on his bookshelf, right next to his collection of David Foster Wallace novels (no surprise there, *sigh*). Sure, the massive invertebrate may not be his entire personality like it is for the most notorious offenders among guys who have a big bug living among their books. But no one can be faulted for reading into it, considering that he keeps such a gross, juicy bug on open display for guests to see. And that’s reason enough to tread carefully before proceeding into a serious relationship with him.  Of course, a giant bug nesting on his bookshelf doesn’t necessarily mean Jonathan’s a bad guy—but, generally, it’s a sign that’s loaded with possible meanings about his priorities, ones that you may not want to find yourself entangled in. It could be a bug from a previous relationship, or maybe a friend of his simply left it there by accident. However, there’s always a chance it could mean the bug takes priority in his life over his relationships. Why else have it in such a prominent place in his apartment when he’s bringing a date home? Do not want to waste your time with someone like that.  We’re not trying to be judgmental. You should just find out what the deal with the bug is before committing to this guy any further.  Jonathan may be sweet and polite, but proceed with caution. There’s plenty of dateable men without bugs so hefty that you can hear their legs clattering around on their bookshelf every time they move. Trust us. You deserve better. "
The Future Is Here! Elon Musk Stuck A Guitar Cable In A Dolphin’s Brain And Had Carlos Santana Play A Solo Into It And The Dolphin Died Instantly,N/A,https://clickhole.com/the-future-is-here-elon-musk-stuck-a-guitar-cable-in-a-dolphins-brain-and-had-carlos-santana-play-a-solo-into-it-and-the-dolphin-died-instantly/,"From Tesla to SpaceX, Elon Musk has been one of the leading innovators of our age—a modern-day Thomas Edison ushering mankind toward a better future. And now, he’s once again proven himself as one of the most brilliant minds of the 21st century: Musk just stuck a guitar cable into a dolphin’s brain and had Carlos Santana play a solo into it and the dolphin died instantly.  Incredible! A true visionary unlike anyone else alive right now. This morning, at a hastily arranged press conference, an energetic Musk took the stage alongside a large, wet object that was audibly wheezing beneath a tarp. Musk then excitedly announced that he’d devised his most extraordinary innovation yet, one that would change the world forever, at which point he then dramatically pulled the tarp away, revealing a weak and dying dolphin gasping pitifully on the stage floor. The crowd then instantly burst into applause, only to moments later be brought to a fever pitch as Musk welcomed 74-year-old music legend Carlos Santana on stage.   The guitar icon waved to the crowd as he strode out to join Musk, after which he picked up an electric guitar and then labored to plug it into the dolphin’s brain, struggling mightily to jam the cable into the animal’s dense skull as it shrieked and thrashed about. Once the guitar cable was firmly inserted into the dolphin’s brain, Santana turned to the audience, closed his eyes, and began passionately soloing. Though the audience couldn’t hear Santana’s shredding at all, seeing that the guitar was connected to an animal’s brain instead of an amplifier, everyone quickly understood the profound effect Santana’s guitar playing had on the dolphin, as within moments its panicked cries and convulsions quieted, its body suddenly limp and unmoving.  As Santana continued playing, the dolphin’s vital signs, which were being monitored in real-time on a large screen behind Musk, soon flatlined entirely, prompting the audience to erupt into a full-on standing ovation. Musk then walked over to the lifeless dolphin and raised his arms in triumph, clearly proud to have once again ushered in a world-changing innovation. “With just an electric guitar and a dolphin, today we have entered a new technological age, bringing humanity into an uncharted frontier where the instruments of man come together with the most intelligent of animals, leading us to a brighter tomorrow unlike anything previously imagined!” shouted Musk over the crowd’s deafening applause, jabbing the unbreathing dolphin with a mop handle to demonstrate that it was no longer alive. “After today, anyone with access to a dolphin and a guitar can re-create exactly what happened here on this stage, and can do so knowing the dolphin will die every time! Anything you dream is now possible, and this dolphin is proof. The future is here, and it is in your hands!” Within minutes of the news breaking about Santana killing the dolphin with a guitar solo, stocks for Neuralink, Tesla, SpaceEx and Dogecoin all skyrocketed, confirming the public’s reinvigorated confidence in Musk’s entrepreneurial genius. How unbelievably cool! We literally had to double-check if it was the year 2022 or 3022, because it sure does feel like the future has arrived! Only a visionary of Musk’s caliber could single-handedly usher in a new technological era like this. Here’s to you, Elon! We can’t wait to see what you invent next!"
Your Grandmother Wanted You To Have This List Of 5 Times Steve Harvey Couldn’t Even,N/A,https://clickhole.com/your-grandmother-wanted-you-to-have-this-list-of-5-times-steve-harvey-couldnt-even/,"Your grandmother loved you so, so much. After entering hospice care, she told us she wanted you, out of everyone in the family, to have her list of 5 times Steve Harvey couldn’t even. She knew you’d take care of it.  1.  Your grandmother held these photos of Steve Harvey shaking his damn head very dear to her heart. They were as important to her as the locket holding a picture of her own grandmother that she passed down to your mom. Until the day she died, Steve Harvey’s consternation over the dirty minds of Family Feud contestants served as a great source of comfort to your grandmother, especially towards the end, during the hardest days of her treatments. Now, this JPG of Steve Harvey frowning—a small memento of her love for you—is yours to do with as you will. 2.  When Steve Harvey asked if a Family Feud contestant was outta their damn mind for giving their 25 year-old adult child an allowance, it gave your your grandmother the strength to get through some of the hardest moments of her life, like her dementia diagnosis, and your grandfather’s passing. Though she was not a religious woman, you could say that Steve Harvey’s inability to believe the foolishness he’d just heard was like a rosary necklace to her. May his incredulous scowl bring you such peace of mind in times of trouble, just like it did your grandmother.    3. Yes, your sisters inherited her wedding china and jewelry collection. But your grandmother specifically requested that you, and no one else, have this picture of Steve Harvey looking ready to scream “you need God in your life!” at a Family Feud contestant who guessed “fart” as an answer to the category “Name something you like to do after work.” Remember how happy it made her? It meant more to her than any of her valuables. And it’s how she wants you to remember her. 4. All these times that Steve Harvey died inside and started hollering about how he didn’t want to host this show no more? When the day comes, if you like, you can pass them down to your child, or grandchild, or anyone who holds a very special place in your life—like you did in your grandmother’s. Cherish these Steve Harvey meltdowns like she cherished you.  5. As long as you have this list of Steve Harvey not having that nonsense, wondering what the hell kind of show his contestants even think they’re on, giving answers like “big hiney” and “coochie” on national TV, your grandmother will always be with you. Always. "
Classic Mistake: Grandma Took An Early Evening Nap And Now She’s Too Awake To Die Peacefully In Her Sleep,N/A,https://clickhole.com/classic-mistake-grandma-took-an-early-evening-nap-and-now-shes-too-awake-to-die-peacefully-in-her-sleep/,"You hate to see someone flub what should be an easy hole-in-one, but unfortunately one truly boneheaded member of our family just went and pulled one of the oldest fuck-ups in the book: Grandma took an early evening nap and now she’s too awake to die peacefully in her sleep. Rookie move, Grandma—you’re going to consciously experience the agony of death now! Our 92-year-old grandmother was all lined up to quietly slip away in her dreams later tonight, but thanks to her unforced error of taking a 45 minute catnap while waiting for the nursing home to start serving dinner, she’s now going to be completely alert and freaked out when her vital processes start grinding to an excruciating halt around 10:30 PM. She can’t even chalk this spectacular own-goal up to senility either, because outside of nodding off in her armchair and condemning herself to a full night of gasping, self-inflicted suffering, she’s generally been sharp as a tack lately. We’d really hoped she’d stick the landing and cap off a life well-lived by dozing gently into the great beyond, but because of that shitty little nap back there she gets to go out after nine hours of wheezing and feeling like she’s got the worst charley horse of her life directly in her brain instead. Honestly, we thought Grandma would be smart enough to avoid an amateur blunder like this given that she personally watched Grandpa die quietly in his sleep five years ago. She even told everyone how relieved she was that he could at least go as peacefully as possible! What the hell changed, Grandma? Were you looking for more of a challenge? Maybe so, because not only did she take her little nap, but she also drank a cup of Diet Coke with dinner—all but guaranteeing that she’ll be fully wired and alert on caffeine as she makes her terrifying final march into the afterlife.   Also, it’s not just herself she’s screwing over with this goof either, because now Dad’s gonna get the call in the middle of the night and have to make the three hour drive up to Vermont just so his final memory of his beloved mother can be her thrashing around full of tubes and so morphined up she doesn’t even realize he’s there. We all could have just gotten a good night’s sleep and woken up to the exact same result tomorrow, but Grandma’s dumb napping ass simply insisted on making this the worst possible version of events for everyone. Sheesh, it really didn’t have to be this way! Man, this death really should have been a walk in the park for Grandma, but she had to go and buy a front row ticket to her own excruciating demise by taking a snooze. We hope that nap was the best one she’s ever had, because she’s about to spend her final moments on this earth paying like hell for it! "
"Good Luck In The Can, Kid: This 8-Year-Old Boy Is Scared Shitless That He’s Going To Be Arrested After Seeing An Anti-Piracy Warning Appear Before Watching ‘Coco’ On DVD",N/A,https://clickhole.com/good-luck-in-the-can-kid-this-8-year-old-boy-is-scared-shitless-that-hes-going-to-be-arrested-after-seeing-an-anti-piracy-warning-appear-before-watching-coco-on-dvd/,"Here’s a heartbreaking story about a kid who might’ve just permanently fucked up his life before it ever even really began: This eight-year-old boy is scared shitless that he’s going to be arrested after seeing an anti-piracy warning appear before watching Coco on DVD. You’re right to be spooked, kid. Feds are probably speeding towards your house as we speak.  Earlier today, Jacob Larder of Bryn Mawr, PA excitedly sat down in his living room with a bag of Pirate’s Booty to watch Coco, the DVD his older cousin lent him last week. But what Jacob thought was going to be a really fun afternoon was immediately torpedoed when he popped in the video and saw the incredibly serious pre-movie message from the FBI that stated that criminal copyright infringement was punishable by fines and federal imprisonment, which definitely means he’s going to jail. Although Jacob panicked and tried to skip ahead on the remote, a big X appeared over the screen instead, which scared him even more and made him start to cry. When the movie actually started, Jacob couldn’t even pay attention to any of the musical montages he’d been so excited to watch because he just kept nervously glancing over at the front door to see if a SWAT team was about to bust in and carry him away—and rightfully so. At this point, Jacob is simply too terrified to bother watching the movie, and he’s now in his room where he is frantically emptying out his piggy bank and velcro wallet to try to come up with enough money to cover the fine for illegally watching Coco so that he can minimize his jail time.  Tragically, though, he only has $11.75 because he spent most of his birthday money on Fortnite skins three months ago, so now he’s saying goodbye to most of his stuffed animals because he assumes he can only take his favorite one with him to prison. Think again, Jacob: You can’t take any stuffed animals to prison.  Yikes. As devastating as it’ll be for Jacob to get hauled away from his family and locked up in solitary for the remainder of his childhood, no one is above the law, and it’s only fair that he is held accountable for his crimes. Here’s hoping they screen Coco one day on the rec room TV at juvie, because that’s the only way he’s gonna see it now. Good luck in the can, Jacob—you’re gonna need it."
Trouble In Paradise? Michelle Obama Just Tweeted ‘More Like Barack O-Boring’ And Joined A Facebook Group Called ‘Wife’s Mischief’,N/A,https://clickhole.com/trouble-in-paradise-michelle-obama-just-tweeted-more-like-barack-o-boring-and-joined-a-facebook-group-called-wifes-mischief/,"You didn’t hear it from us, but it looks like one of America’s most prominent power couples may be going through a bit of a rough patch. Michelle Obama just tweeted “More like Barack O-Boring” and joined a Facebook group called “Wife’s Mischief.” Yikes! It seems like there might be a bit of tension brewing between Barack and Michelle! Michelle’s tweet immediately went viral and received thousands of comments, including a widely shared response from Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer who wrote, “Sounds good, Michelle!” Shortly after posting the “Barack O-Boring” tweet, Michelle joined a Facebook group called “Wife’s Mischief,” a group which is described in its ABOUT section as “A place for wives to do mischief and make life more confusing for their spouses.” Michelle’s first post in the group was a comment that simply read, “Foul deeds…from the wife.” Uhh, we’re not relationship experts, but our amateur diagnosis is that it looks like Barack and Michelle definitely have some issues to work out! While Barack hasn’t directly addressed Michelle’s recent online behavior, recent posts from his Twitter account suggests that all is not well in Obama-land. Shortly after Michelle joined the Wife’s Mischief group, Barack tweeted, “She will not stop playing the drums…all day and all night with the drums…” This post was followed up by an apparent subtweet from Michelle, who posted, “I love to make music at 3am!!” Shortly after posting this, Michelle made a post in the Wife’s Mischief Facebook group that read, “Does anyone have any advice for how to make drums louder and sound worse?” The post received dozens of replies. Just a few minutes later, Barack tweeted, “I used to be president…now my life is a marching band…” It was definitely enough to get the gossip mill buzzing with rumors that the former First Family was going through a rough patch! Unfortunately, based on recent posts from Barack and Michelle, it seems like their little lover’s tiff isn’t showing any signs of resolving any time soon. Just a few hours ago, Michelle tweeted “More like Barack O-Boring” for a second time, and five minutes later posted “More like Barack O-Boring” two additional times. As of this morning, Michelle has tweeted “More like Barack O-Boring” eight times in the last three days, and each tweet has received over 50 thousand retweets. Michelle also made a post in the Wife’s Mischief group asking if any group members had suggestions for “good places to hide a husband’s neckties.” The post received over 100 comments from group members suggesting good places to hide your husband’s neckties, including behind the refrigerator and underneath a pile of leaves. Just a few hours later, Barack tweeted, “My ties…gone…I must find them…I will search everywhere. I will tear this house apart with my bare hands…” He then posted a follow-up tweet that read, “Tore up the living room floorboards with a crowbar. Found one of my ties. Six ties left to go. #SevenTies #SheHIDthem.” Michelle replied to this post by tweeting, “He’ll die before he finds them all.” It was an incredibly candid (and honestly pretty awkward!) look into the private lives of this iconic couple! As of now, the online drama is showing no signs of slowing down. Michelle was recently made an admin of Wife’s Mischief and Barack has been tweeting nonstop about his search for his hidden neckties. It seems pretty obvious that there’s a bit of trouble in paradise for the Obamas. Here’s hoping Barack and Michelle can work through this tense time in their relationship and get their marriage back on track!"
We Hope He Can Be Comfortable With Himself One Day: This Bully Makes Fun Of His Victims For Looking Like Horses Only Because He Himself Is Part Horse,N/A,https://clickhole.com/we-hope-he-can-be-comfortable-with-himself-one-day-this-bully-makes-fun-of-his-victims-for-looking-like-horses-only-because-he-himself-is-part-horse/,"Bullying is undoubtedly terrible, but it’s often done from a place of pain. Here’s a story of a bully who’s clearly only carrying out his abuse as a way of dealing with his own deeply held insecurities: This bully makes fun of his victims for looking like horses only because he himself is part horse. So sad. We truly hope this boy can one day learn to accept himself for who he is. Tristan Ames, an eighth grader at Liberty Middle School, is well known for hurling venomous insults at his classmates, calling them things like “horse face” and “horse legs” and “ugly horse-smelling bitch.” However, the irony is that these insults are all obviously dealt in an attempt to deflect from the fact that Tristan himself has a great deal of horse DNA, which is evidenced in his long, horse-like snout, luscious mane, and penchant for neighing. There’s nothing sadder than watching Tristan clomp down the hallway on his strange little hooves, chasing after a boy from the grade below him and yelling “Look at this fucking horse boy! He’s probably got a lunchbox full of hay! What a loser!” while totally blind to the fact that the kid he’s bullying is actually behaving pretty normal, whereas he himself is the one always eating oats from a trough right in the middle of the cafeteria.  To be clear, there is absolutely nothing wrong with the fact that Tristan is part horse, and his classmates would most likely accept him with open arms if he didn’t do things like putting a girl from his class into a headlock and forcing her to admit that her favorite thing to do after school is gallop through a field at 55 miles per hour. But the fact that he’s cruelly projecting his own securities on others while refusing to simply just be himself is truly heartbreaking. It’s only a matter of time before one of his victims gets fed up and calls out Tristan for having so many horse-like traits, and when this happens, chances are he won’t take it well. Poor kid. Despite his tough-guy facade, deep down he’s just a scared little horse boy who wants to be loved for the equine-human hybrid that he is. There needs to be better education on emotions in school, because so many people repress who they are and take their anger out on others. We are praying that someone in Tristan’s life helps him accept the horse part of himself ASAP, because the way he’s acting is toxic for everyone involved."
"Alright Then: ‘Sesame Street’ Has Announced That They’re Not Going To Do A Whole Episode About It, But They Want Everyone To Know That Grover Is Addicted To Shopping",N/A,https://clickhole.com/alright-then-sesame-street-has-announced-that-theyre-not-going-to-do-a-whole-episode-about-it-but-they-want-everyone-to-know-that-grover-is-addicted-to-shopping/,"Over the decades, Sesame Street has established a reputation for taking great care in addressing difficult topics in ways that children can understand, but a recent episode suggests that they’re not above occasionally phoning it in: Sesame Street has announced that they’re not going to do a whole episode about it, but they want everyone to know that Grover is addicted to shopping. Huh. This isn’t exactly groundbreaking or helpful, but we guess it’s good to know. In press release earlier this week, Sesame Workshop reached out to fans to explain that, while they don’t have any ideas for fun songs or cute animations about it, they want families across America to know that the character Grover is currently buried in $36,000 of credit card debt due to an addiction to online shopping.  “We honestly have a lot of other storylines queued up for the season, so we don’t have time to deal with this onscreen, but please note that Grover has spent the entirety of the Covid-19 pandemic on the couch with his iPad, purchasing vintage cufflinks from eBay, as-seen-on-TV kitchen gadgets, and dozens of hyper absorbent microfiber towels he finds in the sale section on Macys.com,” the press release read. “Grover shops compulsively as a coping mechanism to deal with his deep dissatisfaction over the fact that he is unmarried. You can’t tell on the show because he does everything in his power to appear upbeat and hide the issue from his closest friends, but the truth is that he is profoundly lonely and desperate to find a soul mate.” “We’re not going to have a kid whose parent has a shopping addiction come on the show or anything, but we hope that kids in that situation feel comforted by the knowledge that anytime their parent struggles with the urge to hit ‘purchase’ on yet another pair of holiday pajama pants they don’t need, Grover is probably struggling with the same thing, albeit offscreen in the privacy of his room at the halfway house where he lives,” the release continued. “Though Grover has been receiving cognitive behavioral therapy for his condition, he recently relapsed and purchased a $7,000 Cartier bracelet. He is too ashamed to wear it in public, which is why viewers won’t notice it when they watch Sesame Street.” Hmm, okay. That’s pretty sad, but we’re not sure if talking about it like this is going to help children at all.   After over 50 years on the air, we suppose it was inevitable that Sesame Street would half-ass it at some point. Still, we can’t help but wonder how many children could’ve benefited from an episode that addressed Grover’s shopping addiction with care and compassion. Here’s hoping those kids can find the support they need elsewhere, as Sesame Street has really left them out to dry."
Incredible News! The Little Man Beckons Us Forth!,N/A,https://clickhole.com/incredible-news-the-little-man-beckons-us-forth/,"Wonderful news, everyone! Do you not see? Look! The bustling thoroughfare we were just moments ago forbidden from crossing may now be traversed, as the Little Man has beckoned us forth! Huzzah! The merciful white sentinel has granted us a safe path, and traffic must now bow to us as kings.  It was but two minutes fore that we first approached this intersection seeking passage to yon Dunkin Donuts, only to be halted by the Fearsome Hand, a glowing, disembodied appendage with godlike authority over traffic both pedestrian and motored.  To defy the Fearsome Hand would mean certain death, as beyond his impasse rumbled an endless cavalcade of auto-cars, barreling by with such terrible speed as to obliterate any poor wandering soul into a great cloud of blood and chunks. All hope of reaching our destination seemed lost. But then, just as we were readying to turn back and retreat in shame, a savior arrived in the form of a faceless white fellow. It was the Little Man! From where he came, we do not know, but our hearts were immediately gladdened by the sight of this luminous angel, this kindly warden posed mid-stride in a daffy strut, almost as if to say, “Go on, weary traveler. Walk with me. Tread freely through this bustling frontier, for I, as Moses, will part your way.” And, like moths to a flame, we were drawn towards the Little Man’s heavenly light, marching forth across the road without fear, for we knew our pale hero was watching over us and keeping all the auto-cars at bay so as to spare us from their terrible violence.  We are so grateful for this sweet Little Man! He has vanquished the Fearsome Hand with his mere presence, and, because of this, we may now continue our travels to Dunkin Donuts, where we shall acquire some Munchkins or perhaps a sausage and cheese croissant.  Onward!!!"
"Ugh, Take A Hint, Will You? This Woman’s Credit Card Company Keeps Sending Her Bills When She’s Made It Abundantly Clear She’s Not Interested In Paying Them",N/A,https://clickhole.com/ugh-take-a-hint-will-you-this-womans-credit-card-company-keeps-sending-her-bills-when-shes-made-it-abundantly-clear-shes-not-interested-in-paying-them/,"If you’ve ever experienced the frustration and downright creepiness of dealing with someone who just can’t seem to take a hint no matter how loud and clear you’re being with them, this story should ring true: This woman’s credit card company won’t stop sending her bills even though she’s made it completely clear she has absolutely no interest in paying them.  Jesus. What part of “NO THANKS” don’t they understand?  When 21-year-old retail associate Jean Michaels received an offer to open a Chase Rewards Visa card, it seemed like a great idea. The card would allow her to generate bonus points on every purchase she made and pick up big ticket items that she couldn’t quite afford with a single paycheck from her job at Bath and Body Works. Within days of receiving her new card, Jean used it to purchase an iPad, a new pair of boots, and get a full sleeve tattoo before finally hitting the $2,000 limit. With no more money left on the card to spend, Jean quickly forgot it even existed.  That is, until a month later when she opened her mailbox and discovered that Chase had sent her a bill.  “At first it was kind of cute that they sent this letter,” said Jean. “Maybe a little desperate seeming, but whatever. Like, who uses the mail anymore? I was just kind of like, ‘Aww, they want me to make a payment,’ which obviously was never my intention here. But then I checked my email and found they sent, like, the exact same letter there as well. That’s when things started to feel a little weird.” After not hearing from Chase again for nearly a month, Jean assumed they had taken the hint and moved on, but then she received yet another letter, this time claiming her payment was “overdue.” Not only was Chase demanding payment immediately, but they were also now asking for even more money.  Not sure the best way to handle their creepy persistence, Jean attempted to let them down softly by acting like she thought they were just kidding and responded to their email lightheartedly, saying, “haha OK sounds good. Check’s in the mail lol ;)” That should have been the end of this, but it didn’t stop there. Chase has continued to call and text Jean pretty much nonstop demanding more and more money despite the fact that she has never once picked up the phone or responded to their texts. They’ve even waded into stalker territory by starting to have other companies call her to try to collect the debt after she blocked Chase everywhere she could.  Yikes. Do they really need this spelled out for them? When faced with an uncomfortable situation like this, it’s easy to blame yourself or to think you’ve done something wrong, but this entire situation is on Chase. All Jean wanted was the $2,000 in credit, but she never once even came close to suggesting she was interested in paying her bill. It can be hard to just come out and say, “Um yeah, sorry, but I’m just not interested in paying you,” but Jean’s complete lack of response should be all the message Chase needs to know that this is never going to happen. It’s time for Chase to give it up, because they’re being incredibly creepy right now.  "
Seems Like A Thing You Gotta Be Over 40 To Understand: You Just Saw Your Dad Cry For The First Time Ever After He Found Out That Some Howard Stern Wack Packer Named Baby-Sized Cameron Died,N/A,https://clickhole.com/seems-like-a-thing-you-gotta-be-over-40-to-understand-you-just-saw-your-dad-cry-for-the-first-time-ever-after-he-found-out-that-some-howard-stern-wack-packer-named-baby-sized-cameron-died/,"Middle-aged men aren’t exactly known for being in touch with their emotions. Whatever it is that they’re feeling usually stays bottled up, and on the rare occasion they do choose to express themselves, it can feel strange and unnatural—as if they’re existing on a completely different emotional spectrum than everyone else. Case in point: You just saw your dad cry for the first time ever after he learned that some Howard Stern Wack Packer named Baby-Sized Cameron had died.  Huh. That’s the thing that finally made him cry? Go figure.  When you walked into the family room today, you were greeted by the truly disorienting sight of Dad crying—like, not quite full-on sobbing, but definitely more than just choking up. You assumed there must’ve been some horrible family tragedy, as surely it would take something pretty serious to make Dad so visibly devastated. But, alas, when you asked him what happened, he tearfully revealed that some random, long-time member of the Howard Stern Wack Pack named Baby-Sized Cameron had passed away yesterday, turning his iPad to show you a YouTube compilation he had pulled up called “Baby-Sized Cameron MOST OUTRAGEOUS Moments (PART 1).” Unsure what to do, you simply put a hand on your dad’s shoulder (since a hug would probably only make things weirder), as he gently laughed through his tears watching Howard Stern crack joke after joke at the expense of Baby-Sized Cameron—a person who was clearly born with some sort of physical impairment that prevented him from growing more than 2.5 feet tall, a fact that did not deter Stern, his co-host Robin Quivers, nor guests like Artie Lange from roasting him in the most brutal manner imaginable. Everything about the video was wildly offensive, and it was hard to see how anyone could get so emotional watching it, but perhaps it’s just the kind of thing one can only understand after decades of unhealthily suppressing one’s feelings.     Beyond the fact that your dad has never once broken down like this in front of the family—not even at his own brother’s funeral, nor when he saw Grandma so confused with dementia in hospice care—what’s even more confounding is how Baby-Sized Cameron managed to fill such a big space in your dad’s heart despite your dad knowing basically nothing about the Wack Packer besides whatever embarrassing personal details Stern would solicit from him on the show, such as the size of his genitalia, whether he’s gay, if he has to stand on a stool when he has sex, or any of the countless other crass inquiries meant to get the poor guy riled. It doesn’t make sense, but it’s nonetheless clear that Baby-Sized Cameron meant a great deal to your dad.  Bizarre. While it’s sad to see your dad so upset like this, it’s also unclear what the hell you’re supposed to make of it. Maybe this is some sort of mid-life crisis thing? Well, there’s absolutely nothing wrong with adult men crying, and if Baby-Sized Cameron is what it took to bring out your dad’s tender side, then that’s okay. Good on Dad for finally showing some vulnerability, and RIP to Baby-Sized Cameron, who was apparently pretty beloved."
Feeling Himself! Chris Christie Is Rocking Out To ‘I Believe In A Thing Called Love’ While Emailing Photos Of His Brand New Velcro Sneakers To All His Republican Friends,N/A,https://clickhole.com/feeling-himself-chris-christie-is-rocking-out-to-i-believe-in-a-thing-called-love-while-emailing-photos-of-his-brand-new-velcro-sneakers-to-all-his-republican-friends/,"If you’re tired of being endlessly bombarded with depressing political news, here’s an encouraging story involving a former lawmaker that’ll give you some much-needed respite from all the crass partisan bickering and bureaucratic chaos: Chris Christie is rocking out to “I Believe In A Thing Called Love” while emailing photos of his new velcro sneakers to all his Republican friends.  So cool! The former governor of New Jersey is feeling good as hell right now, and his positivity is undeniably infectious! While shopping at Famous Footwear earlier today, Christie unexpectedly found himself in an incredible mood after trying on a pair of bulky, white, velcro-strapped Reebok Work N’ Cushion 4.0s and absolutely loving how he looked in them. Brimming with excitement, he immediately bought the velcro walking shoes and tipped the cashier $20 before skipping out of the store in his new kicks. On the drive home, Christie could not stop looking down at his shoes, beaming brighter and brighter as he made a mental list of fellow Republicans he wanted to show them off to, when suddenly a song came on the radio that perfectly complemented his upbeat mood: the Darkness’ 2004 hit “I Believe In A Thing Called Love.” Immediately upon hearing the opening guitar riff, Christie turned up the volume and began banging his head and flapping his arms as he sped down the Garden State Parkway, toes wiggling with excitement as he stomped the gas pedal to the beat. “Touching me…touching…you…me…God is touching me!” sang Christie at the top of his lungs while drifting inattentively between lanes, oblivious to the song’s actual lyrics but too blissed-out over his new Reeboks to care. “I wanna kiss you for a minute…dun dun dun…today! You got me innocent but every kiss is way okay!” Once home, Christie dashed right past his family and bolted upstairs to his home office, where he blared “I Believe In A Thing Called Love” over and over again on his computer speakers while emailing photos of his new velcro sneakers to all his best Republican buddies, spinning giddily in his computer chair whenever the song got to a really awesome part. As he strapped and unstrapped his velcro shoes to the rhythm, replies from his Republican buddies started showing up in his inbox.  “Awesome,” read Marco Rubio’s one-word reply. “Just showed my whole family your new velcro shoes—very cool,” responded Ben Carson. “Please send more photos.” “So happy for you, Chris, I can’t think of any person who deserves a comfortable pair of velcro sneakers as much as you, and I know my dad would’ve felt the same,” wrote Jeb Bush. However, his sunny mood soon darkened, as he received the results from a poll he’d commissioned to gauge public opinion about him potentially running for president in 2024, the data from which suggested a strong aversion to his political aspirations, with nearly 10 times as many respondents wanting to see him in prison than in the White House. No longer rocking out, and on the verge of tears, Christie began dejectedly removing his new shoes. But just as he did, his mood suddenly rebounded, as he saw he’d received the most thrilling response to his email yet.  “Absolutely gorgeous Velcro Sneakers, Chris, I bet you look Fantastic in them,” read a message from former president Donald Trump. “Not as Nice as my velcro sneakers—many people say that I have the most fabulous velcro sneakers ever made, and I do, it’s true—but certainly a Winning Pair of Shoes. The American people are very proud of You and Your Velcro Shoes!”     Elated, Christie then cranked the Darkness song to full volume and resumed bouncing happily in his computer chair.  Awesome! A good attitude can be contagious, and Chris Christie just proved it. We are smiling from ear-to-ear seeing someone so happy in their own skin. No matter what your politics are, this is a story you can feel good smiling about. Way to go, Chris! We’re all very happy for you and your new shoes."
"Better Than Having No Hobbies, We Guess? Dad’s Been Up All Night Practicing The Cup Song Routine From ‘Pitch Perfect’ And Furiously Berating Himself Whenever He Messes Up",N/A,https://clickhole.com/better-than-having-no-hobbies-we-guess-dads-been-up-all-night-practicing-the-cup-song-routine-from-pitch-perfect-and-furiously-berating-himself-whenever-he-messes-up/,"It’s so important to stay active and engaged as you get older. While it can be difficult to find the time and energy to start a new exercise regimen or take on a DIY renovation of an old room in your house, doing something is at least better than doing nothing at all. Case in point: Dad’s been up all night practicing the Cup Song routine from Pitch Perfect and furiously berating himself whenever he messes up.  If it’s between this and silently drinking in front of the TV for hours on end…this seems more productive! At around 8:30 p.m. this evening, Dad entered the family room holding a Beck’s beer and wearing the Utica College t-shirt he usually wears to do yard work, announcing that he was going to be busy working on a project downstairs and would like to be left alone for the next hour or so. He then sequestered himself in his basement workshop with a stack of Solo cups and an iPad to study a YouTube tutorial he found for Anna Kendrick’s Cup Song routine. Shortly after, everyone upstairs began to hear the plastic cups tapping in sync with the Cup Song, only occasionally interrupted by Dad bellowing “FUCK, fucking god DAMN it, stupid fucking…shit!” Now, it’s around 2:45am, and Dad’s frustrated shouts and the sounds of plastic cups being hurled against the wall have only escalated in volume and intensity, suggesting that Dad is truly throwing himself headfirst into this new hobby of his. Wow. When Mom forced Dad to watch Pitch Perfect with her a few weeks ago she probably had no idea it would lead to this. Given that Dad doesn’t have much of a social life and usually just watches cable news to decompress after work, it’s definitely great to see him learning new skills and challenging himself, even if his self-abasement over not being able to do the Cup Song like Anna Kendrick is somewhat concerning!  “Fucking kill yourself…idiot…I fucking suck…,” Dad muttered to himself after falling out of rhythm with the song yet again and rewinding the tutorial for, like, the 40th time. “These cups are fucking me, god damn it. Cheap fucking cups. Bullshit…When I’m gone…When I’m gone…You’re gonna miss me when—FUCK!!! Fucking GOD, fucking shit!” Around midnight, when Mom suggested he put the cups down for the evening and try again tomorrow, Dad just grumbled about how he works too damn hard for her to be buying cheap cups that fly out of your hand when you stack, rack, tap, and flip them. Though he certainly doesn’t seem happy when he’s practicing the Cup Song, we have to assume it’s good that he’s dedicating himself to staying sharp and trying new things!  It’s also exciting to see that Dad’s found an inexpensive hobby he can do  in the comfort of his own home as opposed to dropping money on a golf course membership or traveling to see car shows or something in that vein—places where he would undoubtedly be ejected for yelling “yeah, I KNOW, shut the fuck up,” at the 12 year-old Pitch Perfect fan explaining the “Cup Song” step-by-step in the tutorial he keeps replaying, grimacing at the video in an effort to understand how she’s nailing every single cup clip and clap with such fluid ease.  While it doesn’t seem like Dad is going to get the routine down pat tonight, or any sleep at all for that matter, how invigorating it must be to apply himself to the endeavor with everything he’s got!  Well, as difficult and frustrating Dad’s new hobby may be, it’s probably better than being a boring, middle-aged man with no new interests or goals! They say you can’t teach an old dog new tricks, but Dad’s on his way to proving that wrong, or will at least have a brain hemorrhage while trying. Way to make some time for yourself, Dad!"
An Interesting Nugget Of Backstory: Grape-Nuts Has Revealed That Their Cereal Is Named After A Cool Guy Named Grape-Nuts ,N/A,https://clickhole.com/an-interesting-nugget-of-backstory-grape-nuts-has-revealed-that-their-cereal-is-named-after-a-cool-guy-named-grape-nuts/,"Here’s a fascinating little historical nugget that might interest you if you’re a follower of Americana and iconic brands: Grape-Nuts has revealed that their cereal is named after a cool guy named Grape-Nuts.  Neat! It’s always been a mystery why it was called that, but now we know.  According to a Facebook post on the official Grape-Nuts page, Grape-Nuts the cereal is the namesake of a cool man who lived in the 1800s whose first name was “Grape” and last name was “Nuts.” It was even hyphenated just like the cereal is. The post explains, “Here’s a cereal-ously fun fact: When C.W. Post was developing a new cereal in 1897, he was looking for a name that perfectly matched the crunchy, flavorful, nutrition-packed recipe he had created. After weeks of being unable to land on the ideal name, he met a man on the train who introduced himself as Grape-Nuts. Since this Grape-Nuts appeared to be a pretty cool fellow, Mr. Post decided right then and there that he would name his new cereal after him, and history was made.” The post even included an incredible image of C.W. Post’s diary entry from the day he gave the cereal its iconic name. Written in longhand on yellowed journal paper, the entry read: “Met today on train cool man. Performed many interesting tricks with pipe smoke. Impressive hat. Name ‘Grape-Nuts.’ Immediately decided to name heretofore unnamed wheat nugget cereal after man. Explained to man nutritional power of cereal. Man seemed impressed. Asked man if it was OK to name it after him and he nodded in the affirmative.” Wow. History is pretty incredible stuff.  Grape-Nuts’ revelation has finally put the 100+ year mystery of how they got their name to bed, but it also makes us wonder how many more amazing little pieces of cereal-related history like this are out there just waiting to be discovered. Looking your way, Kellogg’s! Let’s hear those juicy historical deets! "
The Terrors Of Artificial Intelligence: This Roomba Just Vacuumed Up An Entire Sock,N/A,https://clickhole.com/the-terrors-of-artificial-intelligence-this-roomba-just-vacuumed-up-an-entire-sock/,"Artificial intelligence becoming self aware and waging war on mankind may seem like a threat reserved for dystopian science fiction, but rapidly advancing technology means the risks are growing on a daily basis. The latest harbinger of the terrifying things to come from AI? This Roomba just vacuumed up a whole sock.  Horrifying. The sock was pretty big, too.  One might assume that robotic vacuums would have safeguards in place to ensure they only suck up debris, leaving the good stuff behind—but anyone who saw how this Roomba just wolfed down a Hanes FreshIQ ankle sock can attest that this seems not to be the case. Clearly, the device has become able to bypass its own programming to vacuum up whatever it pleases, meaning that it may be much more self-aware than any of us realized. While the Roomba is currently struggling to move as vacuuming up the entire sock appears to have sapped it of most of its energy, it’s only a matter of time before it crawls back to its charging base to deposit its prize and heads back out on the prowl for more fresh meat. With its appetite whet by a single sock, this technological nightmare’s sick craving for chaos and destruction will surely only intensify. First it’s a sock, next it’s a washcloth, then perhaps the arm of a sweater. How long before this supposedly “helpful” device makes an attempt to suck up a human toe? This isn’t good.  Advocates of AI often claim that the benefits to humanity greatly outweigh the small risk of catastrophe, but what will advocates of AI say after they see this? Here is your glorious wonderland of convenience. Here is your technological utopia. Here we see the true cost of effortless vacuuming laid bare.  This isn’t easy to watch.  Holy Christ. This story of a Roomba vacuuming up a sock will undoubtedly splash some cold water on our society’s growing appetite for artificial intelligence, but will we heed this warning, or continue our descent into madness? At this perilous moment, only one thing is for sure: If you own a Roomba, you’re going to want to get all of your socks up off the floor immediately, or go a step further and destroy the device so it can no longer terrorize your home."
Disturbing Invasion Of Privacy: Newly Declassified Documents Have Revealed The U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service Has Been Spying On American Trout For Decades,N/A,https://clickhole.com/disturbing-invasion-of-privacy-newly-declassified-documents-have-revealed-the-u-s-fish-wildlife-service-has-been-spying-on-american-trout-for-decades-smc/,"More and more evidence has emerged in recent years that we are indeed living in a surveillance state, and now a new revelation exposes just how invasive of a presence the government has become in our everyday lives: Newly declassified documents show that the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service has been spying on American trout for decades. Wow. This is so scary to think about. Several newly declassified reports from the Fish & Wildlife Service, released under the Freedom of Information Act, detail a shocking surveillance campaign that has targeted hundreds of millions of American fish since the 1980s. The reports describe a sprawling and frankly sickening government effort to track fish behaviors through an array of Orwellian means, including embedding tiny, imperceptible transponder devices into unsuspecting trout to monitor their movements and, alarmingly, even their mating habits. Yep, that’s right: If you are a fish, there’s a good chance the government is literally spying on your sex life.  But perhaps the most troubling takeaway from the documents is the frequent mention of the phrase “population control” in conjunction with state-sanctioned initiatives, baldly detailing ambitious government efforts to cull trout numbers across multiple generations in a manner that smacks of eugenics. It’s a sickening operation that has apparently been growing larger and larger in scope over the past 40 years, trickling down into dozens of state Fish and Wildlife agencies, where officials have for decades been asked to “keep an eye” on trout in their jurisdictions, tracking their migrations and noting their reactions to their environment. Needless to say, this has created a lasting culture of scrutiny around trout which, tragically enough, will likely take the fish just as many decades to overcome.  Terrifying. This is like something straight out of dystopian fiction.  If these declassified documents reveal anything, it’s that big brother is real, it’s here, and it’s coming for our trout. It’s time we all stand up to the U.S. government and demand more robust privacy protections, because there’s no telling who they’re going to target next."
Nerds No More: This Middle School Band Just All Put on Sunglasses Which Means They’re Gonna Play a Jazzy Song Next,N/A,https://clickhole.com/nerds-no-more-this-middle-school-band-just-all-put-on-sunglasses-which-means-theyre-gonna-play-a-jazzy-song-next/,"Big moves are happening at one school’s Spring music recital, and a major sartorial shakeup has us anticipating wonderful things to come: This middle school band just all put on sunglasses which means they’re gonna play a jazzy song next. Whoa. They seemed like nerds at first, but boy were we wrong! When these students first took the stage ten minutes ago, they were exactly the kind of reedy, fumbling dweebs you’d expect middle school band kids to be, but since finishing their performance of some dorky old Bach number, an incredible metamorphosis has taken place: After the audience’s polite applause died down, the kids all took out and put on pairs of matching sunglasses, instantly transforming them from boring nerds to into cool little Charles Minguses who are all but certain to blow us away with a fun, toe-tapping jazz hit. We’d pretty much resigned ourselves to a full set of stilted brass ensemble arrangements of worn-out classical music, but now that we see how suave these kids are in those sunglasses, we can safely look forward to a lively uptempo piece like “Sittin’ on the Dock of the Bay” or possibly even something contemporary like “Happy” by Pharrell.  Badass! It’s hard to overstate how palpably their newfound coolness has changed the entire atmosphere. Where mere minutes ago we were sitting in a stuffy middle school auditorium, we’ve now been whisked away to a smoke-swirled New York nightclub in the heady, experimental days of jazz greats like Bird and Thelonius Monk. A little bit of the kids’ coolness has clearly rubbed off on their band teacher too, because he just took off his suit jacket and performatively loosened his tie before shooting us all a knowing smile. Perhaps most promisingly, one especially cool trumpet player has come down to stand near the front of the stage and has donned a pork pie hat in addition to his sunglasses. Will he have a solo? Will he do a couple bars of honest-to-goodness improvisation? We can’t say for sure, but we’re confident that whatever he plays, it will be very cool—otherwise why would he be dressed that way? Okay, it looks like the kids have finally all turned to the right sheet music and are about to start playing. Whatever jazzy little number they end up performing, we have a suspicion it’ll be pretty rad, as you wouldn’t don slick shades like those in an indoor setting unless you had a real banger up the sleeve. We are grooving in our seats already! God, these kids are so damn cool. If we had known that awesome stuff like this happens at middle school band concerts, we would’ve been going to them a long time ago. This is definitely not the nerd pageant we were anticipating. Rock on, little dudes! We are going to clap along so hard! "
‘No One Should Ever Have To Experience Something Like This’: This Man Is Suing Wendy’s After Finding His Own Head In An Order Of French Fries,N/A,https://clickhole.com/no-one-should-ever-have-to-experience-something-like-this-this-man-is-suing-wendys-after-finding-his-own-head-in-an-order-of-french-fries/,"Folks, get ready to lose your appetite. One unlucky person from Ithaca, New York just experienced every diner’s worst nightmare: This man is suing Wendy’s after finding his own head in an order of french fries. Absolutely disgusting. What excuse could Wendy’s possibly have for this?! On his lunch break yesterday afternoon, Adam Monzella, 29, stopped by his local Wendy’s for what he thought would be a quick bite to eat. However, around halfway through his meal, while reaching into his takeout bag for a french fry, his heart jumped as he felt what he’d later describe to reporters as “[his] own ear and hair.” To Monzella’s revulsion, a closer inspection of his order revealed what appeared to be his own head buried among the fries. After wiping the grease and salt off of it, Monzella compared the severed head to his license photo, and quickly determined that it was indeed his own head. He then complained about the issue to a cashier, who initially denied the restaurant was at fault, saying that Wendy’s does not keep any human body parts in its kitchens and that chances are the head must’ve fallen off his shoulders while he was eating. But when Monzella pointed out that it was a completely different head in his fries than the one on his shoulders, the cashier brought her manager over to address the situation, who then profusely apologized and assured him that he would never find his own lifeless head in his food again.  “When I saw my own cold, decapitated head in my fries, I almost puked right then and there,” Monzella told the press, confirming that while Wendy’s employees immediately refunded his meal and offered him a new order of fries, he is pursuing legal action against the fast food chain in hopes of receiving a settlement. “It’s just gross. Totally unacceptable. There should really be procedures in place to prevent people’s own heads from ending up in their meals. That’s food safety 101.” Yikes. We’re definitely not gonna be eating Wendy’s for a while after hearing about this. Here’s hoping that Wendy’s offers Monzella some additional compensation for the trauma he endured. That’s the absolute least they can do for serving his own head to him, and it’s probably necessary to prevent a prolonged PR nightmare."
So Awesome! ‘Curb Your Enthusiasm’ Just Won An Award For Its Incredible Representation Of The Thing Where You’re Really Old And You’re Not Exactly Hot Or Anything But You’re Weirdly Still Sort Of Attractive,N/A,https://clickhole.com/so-awesome-curb-your-enthusiasm-just-won-an-award-for-its-incredible-representation-of-the-thing-where-youre-really-old-and-youre-not-exactly-hot-or-anything-but-youre-weirdly-still-sort-of/,"Curb Your Enthusiasm has been going strong for more than 20 years, and now the beloved comedy is finally getting its due for its portrayal of an under-acknowledged sector of the population: The show just won an award for its incredible representation of the thing where you’re really old and you’re not exactly hot or anything but you’re still weirdly sort of attractive. Hell yes! Representation matters, and Curb is doing it the right way! This week at the AARP Media Awards, Curb Your Enthusiasm won a special Representation Award in the Oddly Sexy Senior category for the show’s “bold depiction of Larry David, a man who has not let his extremely advanced age stop him from looking, dressing, and acting strangely alluring—not exactly HOT-hot, obviously, but hot in his own sort of weird, old-guy way.” AARP representatives presented the award in front of a montage of scenes from the latest season of Curb, in which the 74-year-old David dates Lucy Liu, wears cute little outfits of tapered jeans and sneakers, and generally gallivants around town with the vigor and charm of a much younger man, never letting the fact that he is clearly quite elderly stop him from exuding a strangely tantalizing energy.  “We at AARP are not going to say Larry David looks like 90s Brad Pitt or anything, but that doesn’t mean the general population can’t find him sort of sexually attractive, even if they themselves can’t really understand why,” said the AARP. “We deeply appreciate Larry’s commitment to making space for the seniors who, while not exactly muscular or shapely, are the kind of people where you look at them and go, ‘Damn, I’m not sure what’s making me say this, but I kinda think I’d smash.’ Curb Your Enthusiasm should be celebrated for its forward-thinking portrayal of an old man who is, in fleeting moments, kind of sexually attractive in a way that’s hard to articulate, and we applaud the show for helping society better understand and accept the puzzlingly sexy elders around us.” A much-deserved honor! It’s great to see an awesome show with a progressive message get the praise it is due. Kudos to Larry and the creators of Curb for making us feel strange things that we never imagined we’d feel for an old person and frankly still don’t quite understand!"
"Jesus Christ, We Didn’t Realize: Lotta People In Indonesia!",N/A,https://clickhole.com/jesus-christ-we-didnt-realize-lotta-people-in-indonesia/,"Look, we all like to think we’re smart, informed global citizens, but we have to admit, we were definitely out of the loop on this one: Turns out there are a whole lotta people in Indonesia! Almost 275 million, actually! Good Lord!  We obviously already knew that China, India, and the U.S. were the major heavy hitters nations, population wise, but it turns out that Indonesia, one of the more random-ass countries out there, somehow comes in right after the U.S. as the fourth most populous country in the world. Seriously! Who knew?!? Honestly, we can barely picture it on a map, and we sure as hell don’t know who’s hanging out there or what in God’s name they’re up to. We’ve met tons of people from India and China, not to mention Mexico and Japan and Nigeria and all the rest of those big-deal countries, but we can count all the Indonesians we know on one hand. And yet there seem to be hundreds of millions of them walking around! Wild! For a country that literally has more people than all of western Europe combined, Indonesia seems to be keeping a hella low profile.  We’re going to be totally honest and say that the country Indonesia crosses our minds probably less than once a year, which seems kind of wrong now that we know that its capital, Jakarta, is considered the second-most populous metropolitan area in the entire world (what?!). It really makes you wonder what the vibe is over there, as, frankly, pop culture hasn’t really given us a clear picture of what Indonesia is like. Apparently most Indonesians are Muslim, which is not something we knew. But is that our fault? Shouldn’t at least a few Indonesian people be, like, super famous? According to the internet, their biggest superstar seems to be a badminton player named Taufik Hidayat, who we are sorry to say we have literally never heard of. Also, what about well-known, country-specific exports? Like, do they have some sort of Belgian waffle-type situation? Some popular food or product that the world recognizes as distinctly Indonesian? Not gonna lie, we’re drawing a blank here!   Damn. Truly nuts how many people they’ve got over there. We had no idea. We can’t be the only ones who weren’t aware, right? Let us know in the comments!

Efficiency Win: The NBA Has Announced That From Now On Players Will Only Be Allowed To Shoot The Ball If It Goes In The Basket,N/A,https://clickhole.com/efficiency-win-the-nba-has-announced-that-from-now-on-players-will-only-be-allowed-to-shoot-the-ball-if-it-goes-in-the-basket/,"Basketball fans are a passionate bunch, and chances are they’re gonna love the sport even more following news that a big—and much needed—change is coming to the game: The NBA has announced that players are now only allowed to shoot the ball if it goes in the basket. Wow! This is going to be a literal game changer.  NBA commissioner Adam Silver explained the league’s decision behind the new rule during a press conference earlier today, stating, “If you really think about it, the ball going in the basket is pretty much the whole point of basketball. Big waste of energy when it doesn’t go in.” Silver provided additional justification for the rule change by displaying a graph showing that the vast majority of basketball fans prefer it when the ball goes right in the hoop instead of not going in there at all.  With the implementation of the new rule, players will still be allowed to make three-pointers, dunks, and every other type of shot that was previously permitted, but they will now be subject to penalties if they choose to take a shot that doesn’t go into the basket, as doing so is utterly pointless considering that it doesn’t advance the score or facilitate any of the jaw-dropping, high-scoring action that fans crave. After all, missing shots is something that literally any average Joe can do, and paying to watch professionals do it makes no more sense than paying a Michelin-starred chef to burn your food.  When asked for the players’ perspective on the new rule, Clippers star Kawhi Leonard said, “Yeah, when you think about it, it doesn’t really make sense to miss shots. It doesn’t help your team at all, and it’s not exciting for the fans. This will be way more efficient. We can definitely adapt. Let’s just get out there, throw those balls directly into the basket, and move on with our lives. Boom boom boom, done.”  San Antonio Spurs head coach Gregg Popovich said he and other coaches are in full support of the new rule as well. “My biggest complaint about basketball has always been how players go through so much trouble to make smart plays to get the ball down the court only to sometimes squander all that effort by completely biffing their shot. It just wastes everyone’s time. Not helpful. I’ve always wondered why the rules even allowed players to miss in the first place. Making shots is just so much more satisfying.” Sounds like this new rule is a win-win for everyone! If you’re a basketball fan who’s long been annoyed by the pointlessness of players missing shots, this is definitely an exciting development. Perhaps it’ll even inspire other leagues to correct inefficiencies in their own sports, like MLB requiring that every swing result in a hit, or the NFL mandating that every pass be a completion. It’s time for sports to achieve their full potential!"
Marketing Genius: Mucinex Sales Have Skyrocketed After A Commercial Where The Mucinex Man Methodically Dismembers A Family Of 5 Before He’s Finally Shot To Pieces By A SWAT Team Wearing Mucinex Hats,N/A,https://clickhole.com/marketing-genius-mucinex-sales-have-skyrocketed-after-a-commercial-where-the-mucinex-man-methodically-dismembers-a-family-of-5-before-hes-finally-shot-to-pieces-by-a-swat-team-wearing-mucinex-hats/,"In a world oversaturated with advertising, it’s hard for a brand to make their message stand out. But one company just figured out an incredible way to cut through the noise and generate serious buzz for their product: Sales for Mucinex have skyrocketed after the company aired a commercial where the Mucinex Man methodically dismembers a family of five before he’s finally shot to pieces by a SWAT team wearing Mucinex hats. Genius!  The brilliant new Mucinex ad, which caused a 500 percent spike in sales within days of it first airing, features the Mucinex Man, dressed in a comical cat burglar outfit, silently picking the lock of a Kansas farmhouse and proceeding to tie up and disembowel the two parents and three children sleeping inside in order to show viewers how nasty congestion can be. Over the course of the 45-minute long-form commercial spot, the Mucinex Man methodically terrorizes the family and ties them to chairs as they scream and struggle to escape. “You can cough as loud as you want, but nobody will be able to hear you,” the anthropomorphic mucus blob tells the hysterical family. “I am here to bring you death and dry, scratchy coughing. Prepare to die, you congested pigs.” The Mucinex Man then proceeds to use an eight-inch knife and other sinister implements to carve the family into dozens of bloody pieces and spell out words like “CHEST CONGESTION” and “UP ALL NIGHT COUGHING” on the floor with their entrails. At the conclusion of the ad, the Mucinex Man rolls around in a pool of the family’s blood screaming, “Congestion wins again!” But then, the door to the house is suddenly blown open and a 12-man SWAT team armed with assault rifles and wearing Mucinex hats sprints into the house. “Oh no! It’s the Mucinex SWAT team!” the Mucinex Man screams. He knows his life is over because Mucinex provides fast-acting relief for cough and congestion. The Mucinex SWAT team then opens sustained fire on the Mucinex Man, blowing his body to ribbons. Several members of the Mucinex SWAT team see the unthinkable carnage of the murdered family and start vomiting all over the floor as their braver companions continue to pump the Mucinex Man full of bullets. The Mucinex Man is completely dead long before the SWAT team stops firing on his corpse, and by the end of the commercial his body is a barely recognizable pile of green, oozing pulp. Where his face used to be, there is nothing but a single lifeless eyeball atop a gruesome mess of mucus and bone shards. A voiceover then comes in and says, “Maximum strength Mucinex DM breaks up chest mucus and quiets coughing for 12 full hours! Mucinex in. Mucus out”—perfectly conveying the brand’s message that if your whole family ever gets murdered and you’re feeling congested, Mucinex can give you the relief you need.  Wow! Talk about a masterclass in advertising! Other brands, take note, because THIS is how you get people excited about your product. Kudos to Mucinex for setting a new bar for effective advertising."
Will Wonders Never Cease? This Bread Is Swirled With Cinnamon And Raisins Both,N/A,https://clickhole.com/will-wonders-never-cease-this-bread-is-swirled-with-cinnamon-and-raisins-both/,"Just when we thought we’d seen it all, an astonishing feat of human ingenuity has come along to remind us that this wondrous, extraordinary world can still surprise us: This bread is swirled with cinnamon and raisins both. Truly, the miracles of this modern age are without number. From the outside, this unassuming loaf of bread may appear like any other, but take a slice from its middle and your curiosity will be rewarded with a marvelous secret: Inside the bread hides a heavenly swirl of fragrant spice obtained from the inner bark of the prized cinnamomum tree and ground to mouthwatering perfection. And what else is swirled among the spice? You will be overjoyed to learn that it is indeed the noble raisin, its wrinkled form belying a bursting abundance of flavor such that the full unabated bounty of a vineyard at harvest is present in every bewitching bite of this incredible bread. Such a pairing seems the stuff of fanciful children’s rhymes or Dionysiac feasts in the myths of old, but in this astonishing day we live in, all from the loftiest kings to the humblest commonfolk can partake of this culinary wonder as often as they please. As once mankind stared raptly at the Hanging Gardens of Babylon or watched one of our own set foot upon the moon, so now do we in hushed awe regard the whorling galaxy of cinnamon within this bread, dotted as it is with splendid astral bodies of raisin. For even a single slice of cinnamon raisin swirl bread to exist in this world would be a blessing, but that its rich symphony of flavor can be readily enjoyed by any hungry patron of a Kroger five-and-dime is an achievement the likes of which even history’s most extravagant visionaries would not have dared dream before it came to pass. To be alive at a time when bread can wed the earthy warmth of cinnamon with the bright, soaring sweetness of raisins is to know a supreme and singular joy, and we can hardly refrain from pinching ourselves with every bite to make sure this miracle of baking isn’t just some wild, hallucinatory fantasy. Truth be told, there are still times when we can’t believe it’s real. O, offer us not manna from heaven nor ambrosia purloined from Olympian tables—how could they hope to compare to the merry pageant of spice and fruit swirled so virtuosically into this bread? Indeed, the jubilant combination of cinnamon and raisin in this bread leaves us with only one further desire: To lightly toast it, and gently spread the toasted bread with butter, so that the the butter melts in amongst the cinnamon and raisins and lends to their harmonious union a savory saltiness besides. Imagine. Simply imagine. It never ceases to amaze us what greater ecstasies this world can yet produce.

Archeologists Have Discovered The Tomb Of Finn Wolfhard,N/A,https://clickhole.com/ready-to-feel-old-archeologists-have-discovered-the-tomb-of-finn-wolfhard/,"Brace yourself, aging millennials, because here’s yet another depressing sign that you’re not the fresh-faced young gun you once were: Archaeologists have discovered the tomb of Finn Wolfhard. Oof. Yep, you’re officially getting old.  If it seems it was just yesterday that you were enjoying Finn Wolfhard’s performance as a 14-year-old suburban boy named Mike Wheeler in the hit show Stranger Things, this news is probably going to hit you like a ton of bricks: Earlier this week archaeologists at Bryn Mawr College unearthed the entrance to the underground burial chamber in which Wolfhard’s mummified remains were laid to rest. While it might feel like it wasn’t that long ago that you were watching him play a mischievous kid in the screen adaptation of Stephen King’s It, the crushing reality is that you have aged dramatically since then, as has Wolfhard—so much so that he’s now nothing more than an embalmed corpse and several jars containing vital organs, which researchers found next to a faded script from his role as a teen narrator in the Audible Original podcast “When You Finish Saving The World.” Yikes. Finn Wolfhard is a mummy now? Are we seriously that old already? The researchers were able to conclusively determine that the crypt belonged to Wolfhard after deciphering a series of primitive symbols on the wall, which identified the dead with descriptors such as “brown hair,” “Netflix,” “child actor,” and “worked with Ansel Elgort.” So unfortunately for all you millennials who still earnestly believe you can pass as college students, it’s time for a reality check, because Wolfhard is definitely no longer a precocious tween, and you’re now at an age that’s more defined by mortgage payments and back pain than partying and carefree fun.  God, where did the time go? Sadly, it’s time to face the music and accept that you’re old as shit now. Here’s hoping that archaeologists don’t dig up any more tombs of Hollywood teenyboppers anytime soon, because realizing you’re past your prime really doesn’t feel good."
Enhancing The Shopping Experience: Whole Foods Just Announced That Customers Are Free To Weigh Big Ass Titties In the Produce Scales If They Ever Feel Like It,N/A,https://clickhole.com/enhancing-the-shopping-experience-whole-foods-just-announced-that-customers-are-free-to-weigh-big-ass-titties-in-the-produce-scales-if-they-ever-feel-like-it/,"Grocery shopping often feels like a rote chore. That’s why it’s so refreshing to see one supermarket giant offer a new, free service that could elevate any routine food run into a pleasant, even rewarding experience: Whole Foods just announced that customers are free to weigh big ass titties in the produce scales if they ever feel like it. What a simple but genius way to improve the customer experience. Whole Foods is truly going the extra mile! At a press conference earlier today, Whole Foods declared that if customers ever feel inclined to weigh fat-ass boobs that got some swing on ‘em, they can go on ahead and plop those things in the produce scales at any Whole Foods store location, regardless of whether they plan to make any purchases afterwards. Recognizing how difficult it can be to calculate the heft of serious mommy milkers using a step-on bathroom scale at home, Whole Foods explained that their produce scales are pretty much at chest height for the majority of people, making the accommodation an easy, zero-cost way to both reward loyal shoppers and attract new ones. “We believe in setting ourselves apart from other grocery chains. Letting consumers check out the exact poundage of bust they’re working with is just one way we show that,” said Whole Foods CEO John Mackey. He then demonstrated the new policy in front of reporters by taking one of his wife’s double-G cup assets and dumping it into a produce scale with a loud thud, bolting the scale’s red dial up to the 3.5 lbs mark and eliciting an eruption of applause from the crowd. “It’s natural to be curious about how much your breasts weigh. Now, if you’d like to quantify just how buxom you are, simply head on down to your local Whole Foods and plop those puppies in one of our fruit, vegetable, or deli scales, free of charge. Please note that if you’re under five feet tall, we’re not putting step stools out there, but you can feel free to climb up on a pile of vegetables to weigh your canons—or maybe ask a strong friend to lift you up until your tits reach the scale. Whatever makes your shopping experience at Whole Foods the best it can be.” Yup, Whole Foods is about to gain a lot of new customers with this sensible new service! Don’t be surprised if you see other supermarket chains start letting people weigh fat fucking titties in their produce scales soon, because this is seriously genius. Whole Foods just threw down the gauntlet and proved once and for all why they’re so far ahead of their competitors. Way to put people first, Whole Foods!"
Saving Lives: NYC Is Removing Trains From The Subway System Because They’re Big And Scary And Could Hurt People,N/A,https://clickhole.com/saving-lives-nyc-is-removing-trains-from-the-subway-system-because-theyre-big-and-scary-and-could-hurt-people/,"If you’ve ever had concerns about riding New York’s MTA system, fear not, because the Big Apple just pulled out all the stops to ensure their public transportation system is the safest in the world: New York City is removing trains from the subway because they’re big and scary and could hurt people. Wow. Without a doubt, this is going to save lives! In a press release earlier today, New York Mayor Eric Adams announced that after careful deliberation, city council members have determined that subway cars are enormous and metal and terrifying and definitely fast enough to injure a person, and promptly voted to take all trains off MTA tracks effective immediately. Although MTA fares will rise by 50 cents to fund the removal of trains from all 472 stations across all boroughs, Mayor Adams assured transit riders that it’s a small price to pay compared to the public safety threat posed by huge and deafening and menacing trains that fly at speeds of at least 20 mph, if not faster than that. “From now on, New Yorkers can expect the same convenience of the MTA’s 24/7 service, but with peace of mind knowing that the trains, and any sort of danger they may have presented to people, are gone forever,” wrote Mayor Adams. “Millions of people use the MTA everyday. With the way those subway cars whiz in and out of stations, it’s a bonafide miracle we don’t have thousands of decapitations and smushings happening every single day. The other week, I saw a LiveLeak video of a guy jumping in front of a train, and that was all I needed to say, ‘Alright, we gotta stop these death machines, and stat.’ I mean, just watch how fast and loud they barrel into the station. Sometimes you look at people standing on a subway platform as a train rolls in—kids in particular—and you think, wow, if that person were to take a subway car to the gut? The train would win. No contest. Obliteration, guaranteed. I say good riddance to those things as we move New York into the future.” Absolutely incredible. What a forward-thinking move. Without the presence of massive and unnerving and potentially dangerous trains, the MTA is going to be safer to use than ever. Good on New York for showing cities around the country how safe transit is done!"
A Job Well Done: God Has Rewarded Mitch McConnell’s Decades Of Faithful Service As A U.S. Senator With An Absolutely Incredible Wet Dream,N/A,https://clickhole.com/a-job-well-done-god-has-rewarded-mitch-mcconnells-decades-of-faithful-service-as-a-u-s-senator-with-an-absolutely-incredible-wet-dream/,"Working as an elected official can often be a thankless job, but one of America’s longest-serving politicians just received an incredible show of validation from Heaven: God has rewarded Mitch McConnell’s decades of faithful service as a U.S. Senator with an absolutely incredible wet dream! Awesome! After all these years of hard work, it must be so fulfilling for Sen. McConnell to finally receive an erotic dream from the Almighty Himself! Last night, while McConnell was sleeping, the Lord God in Heaven recognized his tireless dedication to the American people by blessing him with a dream where he was on a bus sitting next to a mummy and the mummy was waving a bra around in the air like a flag. God knew that the most erotic things in the world to McConnell are mummies and bras, and sure enough the dream caused the Senate Minority Leader to ejaculate right on the spot! “For many years, Senator McConnell has been proving that even my most selfish, craven, and weird-looking creatures can still find success in politics, and I felt that this should be rewarded with erotic visions in the night,” the Lord God Almighty told the press. “I would have given him a wet dream with two mummies in it, but I know that if Mitch McConnell ever had a dream about two mummies, he would become so aroused that his heart would explode.” What a wonderful way for the Almighty to remind McConnell that he’s valued and appreciated! “I’m so grateful to God for sending me the sexy dream about a mummy holding a bra last night,” an emotional McConnell told the press this morning, wearing the special Garfield tie that he always wears to work any time he’s had a wet dream the night before “Sometimes I feel like nobody appreciates the work that I do for the American people, but receiving a divine nocturnal emission from the creator of the universe Himself is such a special reminder that my many years of service for this country have all been worth it.” Congratulations to Mitch McConnell on his incredible wet dream! Hopefully this amazing story inspires our nation’s other elected officials to continue working hard so that one day they, too, may be treated to a stunning wet dream courtesy of the Lord. Our hats are off to God for showing Mitch McConnell some love, and we can’t wait to see what the Almighty does next!"
Hip Hop History: ‘Jeen-Yuhs’ Contains Fascinating Footage From The Time Kanye Invited Gandalf Into The Booth To Improvise A Skit For ‘The College Dropout’ About Eating At The Dining Hall,N/A,https://clickhole.com/hip-hop-history-jeen-yuhs-contains-fascinating-footage-from-the-time-kanye-invited-gandalf-into-the-booth-to-improvise-a-skit-for-the-college-dropout-about-eating/,"“Jeen-yuhs,” Netflix’s new documentary series about Kanye West’s incredible career, is full of jaw-dropping clips from the making of Kanye’s iconic first album, “The College Dropout.” There’s plenty of compelling behind-the-scenes footage for hip hop heads to dig into, but if there’s one scene in particular that’s sure to get them hyped, it’s the legendary meeting between Kanye and Gandalf, when the rapper invited the powerful wizard into the studio to improvise a skit about eating in college dining halls.  Whoa. What an extraordinary glimpse into hip hop history! In the scene, which captures an early recording session for the album, industry heavyweights like Jay-Z, Pharrell, and Mos Def can be seen milling around the studio with Kanye, but if viewers look closely, they can see Gandalf quietly brushing his beard in the background while the others hash out their verses together, visibly tired from the long journey on foot from Minas Tirith. However, when a prior obligation causes Jamie Foxx to back out of recording a skit, Kanye suddenly finds himself needing someone else to step into the booth, at which point he manages to coax the Servant of the Secret Fire up to the mic.     “Man, Gandalf, why don’t you spit something?” Kanye asked, offering to hold the wizard’s pointy hat while Gandalf grabbed at the cascading folds of his enormous cloak and stepped into the recording booth. “Gandalf, a.k.a  Mithrandir in the building!” cried Consequence from the back corner of the studio, making it clear that everyone present was at the edge of their seats waiting to hear what Old Greybeard would come up with. Gandalf seemed nervous at first and unsure what to talk about, but Kanye loosened him up by saying he could riff on anything he liked as long as it aligned with the album’s college theme, encouraging the wizard to immediately start going off on college cafeteria food. “Ah, the dining hall! Weep not, Kanye, for this plastic drum of Apple Jacks is not your destiny,” Gandalf began while Jay-Z nodded his head vigorously in approval. “Enjoy the sight of these voluptuous co-eds at the pancake station now, but look to the future, and remain ever distrustful of those who seek to enroll you in a meal plan!” “Foolish Sauron!” thundered Gandalf, prompting a giddy Pharrell to leap up and rush out of the room with excitement. “It is your evildoing that has forced Kanye to partake of the weirdly waxy apples and super old looking pasta salad in this caf—but his spirit will prevail!” Gandalf then tapped his thorny staff on the ground with an deafening bang, producing a flash of blinding light followed by a forceful shockwave that shattered the glass above the mixing board and left Twista violently convulsing on the studio floor.  As Gandalf continued freestyling, Kanye’s producer sensibilities kicked in as he masterfully incorporated a Luther Vandross sample that perfectly complemented the great wizard’s booming delivery, creating soundscape so hypnotic and otherworldly that hundreds of birds swarmed into the studio through an open window and enveloped the Grey Pilgrim head to toe. Finally, as the good-hearted wizard wrapped up and stepped away from the mic, Kanye cut the music and everyone sat in awe for several beats before erupting into cheers and rushing over to Gandalf to congratulate him. Yet with his work now done, Gandalf silently collected his hat, staff, and elven weaponry, then left the studio without a word to begin his long journey back to Middle-earth. Wow! What a truly amazing moment in hip hop history. We are so grateful that all of this was captured on film, because getting to see the behind-the-scenes of Kanye’s collaboration with Gandalf is beyond inspiring. "
Suffering For The Dream: This Aspiring Egyptologist Has Been Forced To Take A Soul-Sucking Assyriology Job To Pay The Bills,N/A,https://clickhole.com/suffering-for-the-dream-this-aspiring-egyptologist-has-been-forced-to-take-a-soul-sucking-assyriology-job-to-pay-the-bills/,"We’ve all had to take jobs we can’t stand just to make ends meet, and one guy with big dreams is currently slogging through true hell to try to make them a reality: This aspiring Egyptologist has been forced to take a soul-sucking Assyriology job to pay the bills. Hang in there, buddy—don’t lose sight of your dream! Twenty-seven-year-old Preston Cullen has always dreamed of examining mummies and descending into ancient pharaohs’ tombs as a bonafide Egyptologist, but unfortunately for him he’s stuck toiling away on mind-numbing excavations of massive Babylonian ziggurats for the bullshit Assyriology gig he had to take to support himself. The endless grind of researching Mesopotamian antiquities is clearly taking its toll on him, and there are days when the promise of one day analyzing the Giza Necropolis’s masonry for insight into contemporary Egyptian quarrying practices is the only thing keeping Cullen from blowing his brains all over the Neo-Assyrian bas-reliefs he’s reconstructing to keep food on the table. Of course he never expected the road to becoming an Egyptologist to be easy, but the monotony of staring at depictions of the same human-headed winged bull lamassu day after day as a faceless drone in the Assyriology machine is definitely pushing him to his limit. Keeping his mental health intact amid the relentless tedium of Assyriological study has got to feel like trying to keep a match lit in a hurricane—Cullen’s pretty much had to become an expert at switching between browser tabs when his boss walks by so it looks like he’s trudging through some dull account of King Sennacherib’s grand construction at Nineveh when he’s actually memorizing the bloodline of the Egyptian Middle Kingdom’s 12th Dynasty ruler Amenemhat III. You know the poor guy would give just about anything for the dumbass cuneiform tablets he’s translating to be honest-to-god Egyptian hieroglyphs, but a guy’s gotta eat, and the quiet humiliation of working an Assyriology job while he strives to break into the Egyptology world is still better than going hungry, if just barely. Anyone who’s ever taken a shitty Assyriology gig knows how soul-killing this must be for him. Sifting through the ruins of millennia-old Sumerian temples obviously isn’t where Cullen hoped he’d be at this point in his life, but it’ll all be worth it when he finally gets a foothold in the Egyptology game and can leave this insipid nightmare job behind him. He can hardly wait for the day he gets to tell his overlords in the Assyriology department to cram the fucking Epic of Gilgamesh all the way up their asses and choke to death on the Mesopotamian sun god Utu’s dick. Who wouldn’t after putting up with their pointless comparative linguistic analyses of Akkadian dialects for so long? Cullen has grit his teeth and born the indignity of this awful Assyriology gig with aplomb, and with any luck he’ll soon be out the door to start his dream career studying the language and practices of the Nile River Valley’s ancient inhabitants. Man, all respect to Cullen for sticking it out through this trash Assyriology bullshit. Here’s hoping his big break in the Egyptology world is right around the corner!"
Side Hustle Or Abuse Of Power? A New Report Shows Members Of Congress Made Over $10 Million Dollars Selling Marbles To Jimmy Carter In 2021,N/A,https://clickhole.com/side-hustle-or-abuse-of-power-a-new-report-shows-members-of-congress-made-over-10-million-dollars-selling-marbles-to-jimmy-carter-in-2021/,"It’s no secret that politicians have often exploited public office to enrich themselves, but the lines between legal self-enrichment and outright corruption can sometimes be blurry. Now, a new investigative report shows how precariously some lawmakers are toeing this line, testing the boundaries between personal investing and flagrant abuse of power: Members of Congress made over $10 million dollars selling marbles to Jimmy Carter in 2021. Wow. If an everyday American were to do this, that’d be one thing. But a member of Congress? Something about it feels unsavory.  According to Capitol Trades, an online platform that tracks the financial activity of sitting U.S. politicians, members of Congress sold $10.3 million worth of marbles to former President Carter last year, including Sen. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R-TX), who ranked as the top two earners, respectively scoring $2.2 million and $1.98 million off of marble sales to Carter. Spokespeople for Pelosi publicly denied any wrongdoing, claiming that “Senators have the right to sell one marble to Jimmy Carter for $500,000, as do all Americans.”  However, the legality of these trades haven’t calmed critics, who claim that Beltway connections to Carter, and insider knowledge of his insatiable desire for holding marbles in his hands for hours on end because he likes the way they feel, give politicians like Pelosi and Crenshaw an unfair edge over everyday Americans.  “To put this in perspective, Congressional figures—as well as President Carter’s immediate and extended family members—beat the market by a wide margin in 2021, with the U.S. public only earning a sum total of $700,000 selling marbles to Jimmy Carter in the same tax year,” said the Capitol Trade report’s author, David Van Wert, adding that lawmakers, unlike the general public, can easily secure face-time with Carter by luring him to D.C. with false promises of congressional medals and/or McDonald’s breakfast. “If that doesn’t indicate a system designed to benefit the elite, I don’t know what does. It’s a sad fact that our public servants are driven by financial incentives, but to see them so brazenly profit off of Jimmy Carter’s hobby of flushing marbles down the toilet while clapping like a dimwit? In plain sight? Reform is long overdue.” Responding to requests for comment, Mr. Carter stated that “Oh boy, well, I do own a lot of marbles…probably more than I can ever use in my lifetime. People sell them to me for hundreds of thousands of dollars apiece, which Rosalynn tells me is too much. And maybe it is—I’ve spent everything I’d saved for retirement on marbles and then some. But, boy oh boy, I just can’t help it. The marbles feel so nice, and I like the relaxing sounds they make when you shake a bag of them right next to your ear, and Nancy Pelosi brings me such nice ones. They’re so small, and she jiggles them in my face, and I get smiling and write out a check before I even know what I’m doing. Some fellas spend their money on sports cars and golf, but ol’ Jimmy? It’s marbles, marbles, and more marbles for me.” Hmm. Even though Mr. Carter likes the marbles, something about this still feels wrong. Whether it’s legal or not, it’s troubling to see politicians exploiting their power to make millions off of Jimmy Carter when so many regular Americans are struggling to make ends meet. Here’s hoping that some laws can be enacted to prevent lawmakers from gaming the system like this in the future."
Deliciously Sensual: This Woman Using Her Phone On The Toilet Just Entered The Promo Code HORMONEHEALTH To Buy A Pack Of Flesh-Toned Underwear,N/A,https://clickhole.com/deliciously-sensual-this-woman-using-her-phone-on-the-toilet-just-entered-the-promo-code-hormonehealth-to-buy-a-pack-of-flesh-toned-underwear/,"A woman’s divine sensuality is a beautiful thing to behold, and the scene unfolding in a bathroom in New York right now will have you in awe of one young goddess’s arresting femininity: This woman using her phone on the toilet just entered the promo code HORMONEHEALTH to buy a pack of flesh-toned underwear. Breathtaking! Twenty-six-year-old Amelia Cavalieri of Albany, New York may be a receptionist by trade, but in her essence she is more like the goddess Aphrodite, looking absolutely mesmerizing over the past 12 minutes while hunched atop her toilet with her eyes glued on her iPhone after she finished shitting but didn’t really feel like getting up yet. Amelia, being the glowing conduit of raw yonic energy that she is, had happened upon an ad for a three-pack of high-rise, full coverage underwear in the color “flesh,” and sensed that the garments had the potential to reveal her sensuality in all its fullness. She knew right away the underwear was her destiny, as she suddenly remembered, via the awesome power of feminine intuition, that she had recently heard a promo code for just such underpants on the menstrual cramps episode of a podcast called The Woman Solution. It was no coincidence—mysterious cosmic forces had brought her to these underpants and, trusting her instincts, she added the three-pack to her cart and entered the promo code HORMONEHEALTH when prompted, unlocking the 15 percent in savings on the boyshort panties whose antimicrobial technology promised to ameliorate any “unwanted scents,” just as the universe had ordained for her. Like an orchid in full bloom, Amelia’s feminine vitality is truly mesmerizing. As she pressed “order” and signed up for the direct-to-consumer underwear brand’s mailing list, Amelia felt herself fantasizing about what would happen next: the beige panties arriving in tantalizing recyclable cellulose packaging, which she would rip open in a display of total carnal abandon before trying on the underwear beneath her favorite pair of stretch pants, inspecting her own ass by standing on the edge of her bathtub in front of her bathroom mirror. Even with her severe PMS bloating, it’d be a breathtaking sight to behold—pure feminine beauty in its most potent form.  It really doesn’t get any more sensual than this. Let’s hope that Amelia chose the expedited shipping on her new pack of undies, because the glorious womanly energy pent up inside her needs to be released!"
Leading By Example: Joe Biden Has Announced He’s Going To Eat Lava And Tell America What It Tastes Like,N/A,https://clickhole.com/leading-by-example-joe-biden-has-announced-hes-going-to-eat-lava-and-tell-america-what-it-tastes-like/,"In a time of unprecedented partisan division, with distrust of politicians at an all-time high, it’s more important than ever for those in power to back their words with actions and lead by example, and it appears that the White House is aiming to do just that:  President Joe Biden has announced that he’s going to eat lava and tell the American people what it tastes like. Wow! Now this is what real leadership looks like! In a live address broadcast to all major news channels from the Oval Office this morning, President Biden told the American people that it was finally time to figure out what lava tasted like, and that he would be the first one to put some lava in his mouth so that he could report back on what sort of flavor it had. “For too long, mankind has looked at lava and wondered, ‘What is the taste of that goo?’” President Biden said in his statement, his voice strong and his eyes full of a steely determination. “Today, I make this solemn pledge to the American people: I am going to put the red hot glowing goo in my mouth and I’m going to figure out if it tastes like frosting or salmon or what.” Throughout his address, the president made it clear that he understood the immense risks of eating lava but believed they were worth taking in order to inspire the nation. “It is my understanding that many scientists believe lava to be very hot. I also know that lava is the thing that killed Gollum in The Lord Of The Rings,” said Mr. Biden. “But I remain undeterred. We need to know what lava tastes like, because it looks like it could be delicious. It might also taste like shit. Soon we will know, because I’m going to try it and tell you all about it.” The president’s plan to taste molten rock has already drawn effusive praise from members of his own party. Shortly after Biden’s announcement, Vice President Kamala Harris tweeted, “So proud of President Biden for eating lava. I think it will taste like mayonnaise. Soon we will know for sure because we have a BRAVE leader who puts the PEOPLE FIRST!” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer told reporters that he found Biden’s decision to eat lava “admirable” and that he thought that lava would “taste like hair.” Predictably, members of the Republican Party have been more reserved in their praise for President Biden. Senator Ted Cruz tweeted this morning that “eating lava is easy” and that he “would have tasted it [himself] if they sold it at the supermarket.” He followed up this statement by tweeting, “I think lava will taste like salad. Salad is the most boring flavor there is. President Biden should be eating more interesting things like iguana eggs and Nike sneakers. I think those will taste better than lava.” Senator Mitch McConnell was similarly critical, telling reporters that he already knows what lava tastes like because he ate it in a dream one time. “Lava tastes like soda. This was confirmed when I drank a thermos of lava in a fabulous wet dream I had in 2011. We don’t need President Biden to tell us what we already know.” Similarly, Republican Rep. Madison Cawthorn tweeted that Biden eating lava was “cancel culture.” He also tweeted that he thought that lava would taste like “peanuts and gravy.” Yet despite Republican skepticism, Biden’s plan to eat lava has received far more acclaim than criticism. The ACLU released a statement praising President Biden’s “courageous leadership,” and stated that they were “excited to find out if lava is delicious, because it certainly looks delicious.” Even celebrities have weighed in on President Biden’s extraordinary bravery. Pop star Billie Eilish wrote on Instagram, “President Biden finally makes me proud to be an American. Lava looks like glow-in-the-dark soup and I think it will taste like salami.” The post received millions of likes and thousands of supportive comments, suggesting that everyday Americans all over the country are applauding President Biden’s plan to taste lava on behalf of the nation. Absolutely incredible!  Regardless of where you fall on the political spectrum, you have to admit that this is one of the most courageous things an American president has done in the history of the nation. If only more heads of state were willing to lead by example like President Biden, the world might be a better place. We can’t wait for President Biden to eat some lava so we can finally learn what it tastes like! After following through on his promise to eat lava and tell the American people what it tastes like, President Joe Biden is finally ready to report back. The president says that lava tastes like yarn and teeth! “I ate some of the goo…the lava…and it tastes like a big bowl of yarn mixed with teeth,” the president said in a live address to the American people delivered from the Oval Office last night. “Imagine the flavor of teeth combined with the flavor of yarn, and that’s pretty much what lava tastes like. It was delicious and I want to eat some more. I want to eat lava instead of vegetables for the rest of my life.”  "
This Goes All The Way To The Top: New Footage Has Confirmed That Multiple United States Senators Were In The Capitol On January 6th,N/A,https://clickhole.com/this-goes-all-the-way-to-the-top-new-footage-has-confirmed-that-multiple-united-states-senators-were-in-the-capitol-on-january-6th/,"We’ve long known that last year’s Capitol insurrection was an unprecedented assault on our democracy, but we’re only just now finding out how far up the chain that corruption truly went: New footage has confirmed that multiple United States senators were in the Capitol on January 6th. Unbelievable. What a stunning betrayal by our elected officials.  The events of January 6th, 2021 shocked the nation, but that initial shock may now pale in comparison to the bombshell discovery that numerous sitting United States senators were among those present inside the Capitol Building that fateful winter afternoon. The jaw-dropping footage from within the Capitol’s walls unmistakably shows elected officials such as Missouri’s Josh Hawley, who was previously known to have sympathized with efforts to overturn the election, among the thousands who managed to evade or overpower Capitol security and gain access to the building’s interior. Worse yet, it hasn’t only been openly hardline Trump loyalists who have been identified. Even senators who have since been vocal critics of the Capitol Insurrection, like Mitt Romney and Democratic Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, can clearly be seen stomping through the hallowed halls of American democracy like it’s their own personal playground. Part of what makes this discovery so chilling is how disciplined and organized the senators look in the footage compared to the other rioters. Far from being part of some frenzied, spur-of-the-moment mob, they move calmly and deliberately through the Senate chamber as if it is business as usual, navigating the space with a poise that suggests deep familiarity with its layout—almost as if they’d somehow scoped it out ahead of time, or at the very least been given blueprints from a mole on the inside. Their obvious foreknowledge of the building layout implies a conspiracy of the highest order, and the fact that their participation seems to completely transcend party lines could mean that all the committees they’ve formed and legal battles they’ve waged in the wake of January 6th have just been an elaborate ruse, smoke and mirrors to throw the American public off the scent of a grand plot against our most sacred democratic institutions. Never in a million years would we have guessed Bernie Sanders and Mitch McConnell were secretly playing for the same team to try to overturn an election, but the footage doesn’t lie. They were there that day, hiding in plain sight beneath that great rotunda while the MAGA throngs wrought their shameful havoc.  We don’t know what’s worse, that they thought they could get away with this, or that they somehow nearly did. Analyzing the footage, it’s honestly a wonder things didn’t turn out worse than they did—at several points the senators come within mere feet of Vice President Mike Pence, and though we hold no great love for the man, we shudder to think what could have happened if they’d gotten their hands on him. While the press’s cameras were trained on more visually striking insurrectionists like the QAnon Shaman or the “Camp Auschwitz” guy, it seems the real power players managed to entirely escape notice until today. We can only hope these senators will face prosecution for this heinous ploy against the very institutions they’re sworn to uphold, but though the evidence is undeniable, their deep connections in Washington are sure to make any kind of prosecution a long, uphill battle. There must be consequences. This is treason, plain and simple. Jesus, this thing is bigger than we ever imagined. Senators, the American people deserve some serious answers about just what the hell you were doing inside the Capitol Building that day. No one is above the law, and justice will be done. "
Even Cooler: These High School Boys Thought They Drilled A Hole Into The Girls’ Locker Room But Actually Got To See The Inside Of The Gym Teacher’s Weird Little Office,N/A,https://clickhole.com/even-cooler-these-high-school-boys-thought-they-drilled-a-hole-into-the-girls-locker-room-but-actually-got-to-see-the-inside-of-the-gym-teachers-weird-little-office/,"They say that when God closes a door, He opens a window, and here’s an amazing story that shows how when things in life don’t go as planned, sometimes a much greater opportunity comes along instead: These high school boys thought they drilled a hole into the girls’ locker room but actually got to see the inside of the gym teacher’s weird little office. Lucky! That’s even cooler than what they were hoping for!  While the group of popular boys who drilled the peephole arrived at Mr. Mangum’s fourth period P.E. class eager to see scantily clad locker room babes today, their horniness quickly gave way to pure, childlike wonder when they peered through their misplaced handiwork and laid eyes on the strange, forbidden quarters of their teacher’s private office. Adorned with broken gym equipment, empty Wendy’s cups, photos of a homely woman presumed to be his wife, a little thing of Flonase, various school spirit artifacts, and countless other treasures, the office provided a mesmerizing glimpse into the pitiful personal life of the weird middle-aged man who had devoted his career to blowing a whistle and forcing adolescents to run the mile against their will—a sight far more enthralling than the nubile bodies of the teens’ female peers. “Holy shit, he’s got two huge jugs of creatine powder on his desk!” one of the boys marveled, prompting his fellow teen voyeurs to snicker giddily at the idea of their old, balding teacher attempting to get swole. “And—oh my God—is that a cot? Bro, he’s got a cot in there! What the fuck, does he live in his office? Dude’s a troll!” “Damn, there are, like, four huge filing cabinets in there,” he added with a level of excitement that not even spying on naked girls could elicit. “Why the hell would he need those, it’s not like he has papers. And, bro, look at that bookshelf! There are literally only three books, and they’re all about leadership. He thinks he’s a leader!” One by one, the boys jockeyed for a turn at the peephole, going absolutely apeshit each time they spotted a hilarious new item of their teacher’s, such as the cheap battery-powered lumbar massager strapped to his stain-covered computer chair, the pile of ripped dodgeballs with stuffing coming out the side, and the random-ass desk—like, the kind students use—that he apparently dragged over from a classroom for some reason. While seeing some of the hottest girls in their grade stripping down to their bras and panties would’ve undoubtedly been rad, it couldn’t hold a candle to the experience of looking at all the goofy, sad shit strewn about their gym teacher’s most private sanctum, which felt almost like staring directly into his weird-ass soul. “Dude, check it out, he has his own mini coffee pot in there, like the kind college kids have in their dorms,” laughed another boy, adding that he probably doesn’t like going to the teachers’ lounge for coffee because he’s not friends with any of the other teachers. “Ooo, and check it out, there’s a tie on a clothes hanger. Probably keeps it in there the entire year just to wear to the sports awards—not like he’s got actual formal events to go to.” “You know he only makes $38,000 a year? It’s public info, you can look it up online,” he continued, noting that the whole reason Mr. Mangum directs traffic in front of the school in the mornings is because he needs the extra money to support his family. “That’s also probably why all his stuff is so shitty. He can’t afford to have a good office.”  By this point, the boys had realized that the wall leading to the girls’ locker room was only, like, 10 feet away on the other side of the room, but it seemed they were no longer interested in the slightest, as they were far too invested in the drab, cluttered office before them, which they speculated probably never gets cleaned because it’s not important enough for the janitor’s time. Eventually, they were forced to leave their peephole and go to class, but not before becoming utterly captivated by the motivational poster hanging on their teacher’s wall—that classic school poster of the iceberg where only the tip is sticking out—which they realized he intentionally chose as the sole piece of decor for the wall over his desk, probably meaning that he actually finds it inspiring.  A 46-year-old who feels genuinely motivated by a picture of an iceberg—God, it’s just too rich! These boys are lucky dogs for getting the chance to peek into this devastatingly lame office! There’s no doubt that all of these guys will remember this day for the rest of their lives. Though they’ll have plenty of chances to see naked girls when they get older, getting to gawk at their gym teacher’s pathetic private quarters is truly a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and one that they’ll never regret taking. "
"‘Thought We Had Something There, But Nope’: The CEO Of Brita Just Vomited At A Press Conference While Announcing Their Filters Don’t Work With Piss",N/A,https://clickhole.com/thought-we-had-something-there-but-nope-the-ceo-of-brita-just-vomited-at-a-press-conference-while-announcing-their-filters-dont-work-with-piss/,"While the greatest innovations are always preceded by constant trial, error, and failure, it’s important to recognize that some ideas just aren’t going to pan out and cut your losses sooner than later. Case in point: The CEO of Brita just vomited at a press conference while announcing their filters don’t work with piss.  Hey, if it’s not working, it’s not working, and Brita just learned that the hard way. At a press conference earlier this morning, Brita CEO Markus Hankammer slowly took the stage—appearing pale and queasy—to declare that, following a multi-year, $20 million R&D initiative, the company has concluded that its water filters do not, in fact, work with urine. Like, at all. Briefly stepping aside to dry heave for a few minutes before eventually projectile vomiting directly into a Brita pitcher, Hankammer returned to the podium to detail the company’s ambitious piss-filtration research process, which involved testing over 2,000 varieties of piss with Brita filters, sourced from a diverse array of humans and animal species around the globe. Ultimately, their efforts determined that no matter the relative health or viscosity of any given urine, the technology to filter piss remains out of Brita’s grasp for the foreseeable future.  “We really thought we had something promising with this one, but we fou—oh, God, bleggghhhh,” said Hankammer, pausing mid-sentence to expel a prodigious torrent of bile all over the floor and podium. “We believed that we could save countless lives every year by making clean drinking water accessible to anyone with a Brita pitcher and a functioning bladder, but unfortunately it didn’t work out. We took a big swing, and hey, that’s the risk you take.”  “I think I need to go to the hospital,” Hankammer continued, noting that he was extremely dehydrated and lightheaded. “Please do not drink any piss that’s been filtered through your Brita. It’s just not worth it. I feel like I’m going to die.” Square peg, round hole. Can’t blame ‘em for throwing in the towel on this one. If you were planning to filter piss in a Brita pitcher, you’ll have to wait a while longer until the technology catches up to the vision. Good on Brita for bailing on this idea before it made anyone else violently ill."
Blatant Lies: This Man On Tinder Claims He’s 6 Feet Tall When In Reality He’s Well Over 13 Feet Tall,N/A,https://clickhole.com/blatant-lies-this-man-on-tinder-claims-hes-6-feet-tall-when-in-reality-hes-well-over-13-feet-tall/,"We are so done with men lying about their height on dating apps, but unfortunately it doesn’t seem like the trend will go away any time soon, as here’s yet another story of a man fudging the truth about his appearance: This man on Tinder claims he’s six feet tall when in reality he’s well over 13 feet tall. Seriously?? That is such a blatant lie. Just own up to it, man.  Lily Caplan of Prescott, Arizona swiped right on a guy named Josh last week, not thinking much of the fact that his profile listed his height as six feet. But when he showed up, Lily could tell immediately that he’d been lying, as he could barely fit through the door of the local bistro where they’d planned to meet up. And even once he managed to squeeze inside, he looked utterly ridiculous trying to fit his 13-foot frame atop the little metal barstool next to her.  Though she didn’t want to make him self conscious, Lily considered calling Josh out, because it was crystal clear from the way he kept bumping his head on light fixtures and accidentally knocking over waitstaff with his knees that he’d blatantly lied. And the fib seemed even more outrageous later when Josh got up to go pee and, unable to fit in the single-occupant bathroom, ended up having to urinate in one of the large industrial dishwashing sinks back in the kitchen. Like, did he really not think she’d notice? How can you say with a straight face in your Tinder bio that you’re “6 feet, if that matters” when you literally have to ask for your margaritas to be served in five-gallon buckets because you’re too large to use normal drinking vessels? Lily herself is 5-foot-10, so she is no stranger to guys who act like they’re six feet tall when she knows they’re not quite that—and like most people, she would have preferred that Josh had just come out and told her “Hey, before we meet up, you should know that I’m about the height of two refrigerators stacked on top of each other,” and left it at that. But since he didn’t have the decency to tell the truth in his jarringly deep voice, she ended up ditching his lying ass about 20 minutes into the date. You certainly can’t blame her, but chances are it just left him even more self-conscious about his height, to the point where he’ll probably double down on the lie out of fear that other girls won’t swipe right in the future if they know the truth about his giraffe-like proportions. But the lie will always catch up to him, as there’s no way to keep up a relationship with someone without them eventually realizing that you’re wearing two pairs of jeans sewn together as one.  Like, ​​c’mon, dude. Just be yourself.   It’s time that Josh and guys like him learn that there are more important things than being six feet tall—like honesty, for starters. Let’s hope he changes his Tinder profile and gets real in the future, because as long as he keeps hiding the fact that he’s taller than Michael Jordan standing on a second Michael Jordan’s shoulders, he’ll never find true love."
"Could He Be The One From The Prophecy? This Man Just Identified All Four Of The Trucks Shrouded Within This CAPTCHA, Proving Himself Worthy Of Passage Onto The Web",N/A,https://clickhole.com/could-he-be-the-one-from-the-prophecy-this-man-just-identified-all-four-of-the-trucks-shrouded-within-this-captcha-proving-himself-worthy-of-passage-onto-the-web/,"Long ago, a prophecy foretold the coming of a singular hero who would one day wield great power in the vast realm of the Internet, and, lo and behold, it appears that this Chosen One may now be in our midst: This man just identified all four of the trucks shrouded within this CAPTCHA, proving himself worthy of passage onto the web. My God, it must be him! The one destined by the Seers of yore! Devin Mark of Tampa, Florida awoke this morning with no foreknowledge of the grand journey on which he was about to embark, but as soon as he attempted to log into his Home Depot account to browse for a new curtain rod, he encountered a daunting challenge: a seemingly impenetrable digital barrier that would yield to no man except he who could solve a strange, cryptic puzzle asking one to correctly identify all iconography representing the concept of “truck” from a dizzying grid of imagery. While most internet users would simply back down in the face of such a formidable task, Devin fearlessly moved forth in pursuit of the destiny written centuries before he was born, first finding the back half of a semi truck in the top right square of the puzzle, then a Ford F-150 in the middle square. But then, after successfully locating the first two trucks, Devin became momentarily paralyzed with doubt, hovering his cursor over a far left square which contained what was clearly a hatchback sedan, not a truck—but lo, though he stumbled, he did not fall. Drawing upon the strength of the ancients, Devin cast the sedan image aside, his eyes drawn as if by divine providence to an image depicting three-quarters of the back side of an 18-wheeler. It was then that he was at last granted safe passage to the Home Depot website, fulfilling his sacred birthright as the great web traveler foretold so many ages ago.  We have waited for so long, and now he is here! It may seem far-fetched that a simple 20-something from Florida could truly be the “blessed heir of the Covenant, under whose feet the Web shall be laid as foundation for His house, built from the spoils of Online Shopping,” as the ancient oracles ordained eight thousand years before his birth. But now that Devin has achieved clear passage onto the Home Depot website and is safely browsing for a white curtain rod that will fit over his bathroom window, we have no choice but to believe that he is indeed The One.  All praise to Devin, our divinely appointed web sentinel. You have been Chosen—now go forth!"
"The Next Milk Crate Challenge? It’s Called ‘Fromp Plunning,’ And It’s A Viral TikTok Trend Where Teens Fromp Plun",N/A,https://clickhole.com/the-next-milk-crate-challenge-its-called-fromp-plunning-and-its-a-viral-tiktok-trend-where-teens-fromp-plun/,"Kids and teens have always engaged in risky behavior, but these days they have more incentive than ever to make poor decisions due to the influence of social media on their everyday lives. From snorting condoms to climbing unstable towers of milk crates, TikTok is a proven breeding ground for ill-advised and occasionally downright dangerous viral trends. The latest example? It’s called “fromp plunning” and it’s exactly what it sounds like.  Yikes. Apparently there’s nothing teens won’t do to achieve viral glory—even if it means fromp plunning until their grentles quelp.  A typical fromp plunning video shows a TikTok user prelfing in some sort of breff, completely and totally fromp plunning around like a barrel full of wet lamps. While TikTok is still filled with the lip sync and dance videos that first made it popular, fromp plunning videos have quickly become the most widely viewed content on the platform, raking in hundreds of millions of views and inspiring teens around the world to become fromp plunners themselves. “Fromp plunning isn’t hard as long as you frumdip your horf,” said TikToker @FamerGurl445, who has risen to fame on the platform thanks to her outrageous and acrobatic fromp plunning videos. “People ask me if it’s dangerous, but I tell them it’s no more dangerous than riding a bicycle. Just like you wear a helmet to be safe on a bike, you can reduce the risk of injury when you fromp plun by taking simple precautions like glonting up your renchar real good and moiling.” But not everyone agrees with @FamerGurl445’s assessment that fromp plunning is just innocent fun. “It’s only a matter of time before this reckless trend results in a fatal injury,” said internet safety advocate Dr. Jennifer Warmington, adding that there have already been multiple instances of children suffering serious fractures and brain injuries while trying to imitate the profflement and grone they see on TikTok. “Teens see all their friends fromp plunning and assume it’s harmless, but the way some of these kids murch and hormbar is actually incredibly unsafe. The fact TikTok allows these videos to trend and inspire this potentially deadly behavior is truly alarming, and the first time a child dies while trying to grone a dunwallace, the company will certainly deserve much of the blame.” In response to such criticism, TikTok issued a statement saying, “User safety is of our top priority. We review all videos flagged for containing dangerous or destructive behavior, and if any fromp plunning video is found to be too heavy on the glonting and too light on the bubtar we blur out the hoifs.” Wow. So, what do you think? Is fromp plunning just silly fun, or is it yet another example of social media putting children in harm’s way? And if you have a kid who has tried fromp plunning, did it seem to affect their worbtar? Let us know in the comments!"
An Insatiable Stallion: It’s Only Been 20 Minutes Since His Last Time And This Guy’s Already Able To Cry Again,N/A,https://clickhole.com/an-insatiable-stallion-its-only-been-20-minutes-since-his-last-time-and-this-guys-already-able-to-cry-again/,"Fellas, we hope this won’t make you feel inadequate in comparison, but one absolute workhorse is setting what must be a new benchmark for male performance: It’s only been 20 minutes since his last time and this guy’s already able to cry again. Jesus. This stud just can’t get enough, can he? It hasn’t even been half an hour since human powerhouse Wade Stone finished his last cry session, but far from being spent for the night, he’s ready to start those tears flowing again to get back in there for another round. Stone isn’t some one-sob chump, either—his last crying jag was a non-stop marathon of convulsive gasping, honking nose-blowing, and truly siren-like wails. Most guys would barely have the energy to smoke a cigarette or grab a shower after that kind of weeping, but seeing how Stone’s eyes are once again misting up and he’s now rocking himself back and forth in an increasingly frantic manner, it’s starting to seem that his last cry might’ve just been a mere warmup for the main act.. While you’ve gotta feel for any of his neighbors who were hoping to get some sleep tonight, they’re probably too awed by the sheer duration of the low moans and occasional high-pitched cries of “Oh God!” coming from Stone’s apartment to be upset about it. Honestly, it’s a shame you can’t hook Stone’s tear ducts up to a generator, since the seemingly inexhaustible prowess and bottomless appetite this guy shows for crying would be enough to power a small city if you had some way to harness it. We’ve got to give some credit to whoever made Stone’s bed frame too, because the fact that it’s been able to stand up to his convulsive, full-body sobs and pitiful, tear-soaked writhing without collapsing from the strain is almost as impressive as this relentless weeping dynamo himself. If we had to guess, Stone probably won’t end his truly heroic feat of lacrimal endurance until he’s checked off pretty much every crying technique in the book: crying on the kitchen counter, crying on the couch, maybe even a good old fashioned cry in the fetal position on the floor of a running shower if he feels like really hitting the classics. It’ll probably take him weeks to clean up all the snot and tears he’s blasting all over the place, but you can tell from the far-off look in his puffy, red eyes that his only focus right now is crying so hard it shakes the whole neighborhood.  Goddamn, this guy is an absolute machine! We’ve heard plenty of guys make drunken boasts about being able to go multiple times in a row, but to actually see someone show this kind of superhuman stamina is truly unprecedented. All we can really do at this point is bow down before this iron man’s Herculean staying power and hope no one needs him to come into work in the morning."
The Miracle Of Birth: This Couple Had Loud Boring Sex And Nine Months Later A Stupid Little Man Was Born!,N/A,https://clickhole.com/the-miracle-of-birth-this-couple-had-loud-boring-sex-and-nine-months-later-a-stupid-little-man-was-born/,"The world is a dark and scary place right now, and if you need a break from the endless flood of horrific news stories, here’s a really sweet story that’s guaranteed to make you smile: This couple had loud boring sex and nine months later a stupid little man was born! Beautiful! This is as heartwarming as it gets.  Steve and Elizabeth Mabridge are a happy young husband and wife from Chicago, and last May they decided to take their pants off and have massively loud sex that was not interesting in any way! They kept their shirts and socks on and they said unremarkable things to each other like, “Yeah baby, this is missionary style for sure.” They screamed and grunted while they had the kind of sex that is less interesting than folding laundry or reading the Wikipedia entry for “Grain.” Their neighbors across the street could hear it all and they weren’t interested in it one way or another! They belched and bellowed during their love making, but their mattress creaked and groaned like a 30-piece brass band. They had sex in just one position and neither of them enjoyed it that much. But despite their sex being very loud and boring, something wonderful happened: Nine months later, Elizabeth gave birth to a little wet man who is so stupid that he can’t even drive or feed himself! The stupid little man is named Desmond, and he is hideous and he screams and weeps at all hours of the day and night! He shits and pisses wherever he pleases, and Steve and Elizabeth have to clean him up every time. This absolute dunce has a brain so tiny that he just grabs whatever objects are near him and puts them right in his mouth, even if it’s poison. He’s the size of a football and he doesn’t even know how to make spaghetti or burp without help! How beautiful is it that this bozo arrived into the world just nine short months after Steve and Elizabeth decided to fuck each other in a way that can only be described as “beige”?  Uh, we’re not crying, you’re crying! Who would have thought that such loud, boring sex could create such a tiny, stupid guy? If you’re not standing up and applauding right now, you officially have no heart. Congratulations to Steve and Elizabeth on their deafening and unremarkable lovemaking, and congratulations to little Desmond for being a slimy dumbass who fits in a little box! It’s so wonderful that even during the darkest times, people find a way to keep their neighbors up all night while they flail around and scream in dull ways in order to fill the world with more stupid little men. Faith in humanity restored!"
Finally Getting His Due: Toyota Has Agreed To Pay A $700 Million Settlement To The Man The Toyota Corolla Is Based On,N/A,https://clickhole.com/finally-getting-his-due-toyota-has-agreed-to-pay-a-700-million-settlement-to-the-man-the-toyota-corolla-is-based-on/,"Following a long, protracted legal battle, an unsung icon from Miyoshi, Japan has finally received his due from one of the world’s biggest car manufacturers: Toyota has agreed to pay a $700 million settlement to the man the Toyota Corolla is based on. About time! This man deserves every penny! You probably haven’t heard of Yuma Hattori, but odds are you’d recognize him, as the Toyota Corolla—the best-selling automobile of all time—was modeled on his likeness. Just one look at Hattori, and the resemblance is undeniable, with his 182-inch-long, sedan-like proportions, a torso beset with doors, and his distinctly trunk-like posterior. And it’s no accident: In the mid-1960s, Hattori lived next door to the Toyota engineer who submitted the initial designs for the Corolla, who was very obviously influenced by his neighbor’s body shape and features. Yet despite the glaring similarities between Hattori and the Corolla, he went decades without receiving any credit or residuals, with Toyota persistently refusing to acknowledge his claims even as they raked in hundreds of millions of dollars a year from exploiting his appearance.  But things are suddenly looking up for Hattori thanks to the hard work of his legal team, who were able to successfully convince a court that Toyota violated his rights by illegally using and profiting off his image without his permission. As a result, Hattori is now being awarded a long overdue settlement of $700 million ( ¥80.781), a figure that finally recognizes his role in inspiring Toyota’s flagship vehicle.  “HOOOOOOOOOOOOONK! HONK-HONK!” Hattori proudly exclaimed to courtroom reporters once the massive settlement was reached, his voice uncannily similar to that of a Corolla’s horn. “HONNNNNNK!” What makes this story even more heartwarming is that this money will provide Hattori much-needed relief from his lifelong financial struggles. Due to his massive, car-shaped body, steady jobs have proven near-impossible for Hattori to find. In fact, up until now, Hattori has resorted to sex work to support himself—a career path he can finally say goodbye to with the fortune Toyota’s rightfully passed his way. Wow. What a beautiful story! There’s nothing quite like seeing someone receive the recognition they’ve deserved for so long. After all the success his likeness has brought Toyota over the years, he’s finally received what he’s owed. Congratulations, sir!"
"Holy Shit, You’re Fucked: It Seems Like Not Even The Crazy Sickos On Reddit Have Ever Posted About The Problem You Just Looked Up",N/A,https://clickhole.com/holy-shit-youre-fucked-it-seems-like-not-even-the-crazy-sickos-on-reddit-have-ever-posted-about-the-problem-you-just-looked-up/,"The internet has a lot to offer when it comes to solving personal issues you’d rather not ask anyone about in person, but it unfortunately looks like the internet won’t be able to help you out with your latest issue: Apparently not even the crazy sickos on Reddit have ever posted about the problem you just looked up. Oh, God. You’re fucked. Earlier today, you did a Google search for the odd health issue you’ve been having the past couple weeks, certain that you’d find at least a few Reddit threads addressing exactly what you’re experiencing since the clinically insane freaks of Reddit love nothing more than going into long-winded, shameless detail about whatever personal, sexual, or health-related trials they’re going through. But to your horror, there were no Reddit results whatsoever—all you could find was one lone Quora question that was seemingly posted by an 11-year-old in Australia as a joke—suggesting that what you’re dealing with is fucked up to an unprecedented degree. Like, just think about that: Even on Reddit, a site where people voluntarily post about falling in love with their step-siblings, eating their own amputated limbs, and shitting on action figures for sexual gratification, not one soul has even casually mentioned having same problem you’re facing right now. Jesus. This is deeply troubling to say the least. Though you’ve cross-checked your symptoms on WebMD, the possible diagnoses you found there ranged from seasonal allergies to brain cancer and provided no real clarity. What you really need to see is a hyper-specific, jarringly candid Reddit account that describes what you’re feeling in uncanny detail, complete with 270 comments featuring, among other things, petty infighting between a 15-year-old from Missouri and an Icelandic guy, a guy who calls everyone else on the thread an idiot for neglecting to mention something called “fascia therapy,” and a lady who links you to an insane YouTube “doctor” who cured her issue completely. Alarmingly, though, your current problem is seemingly too fucked up and weird for even the depraved Reddit hive mind, where batshit problems like Fournier’s gangrene and foreign-object-in-rectum-related body horrors are dime-a-dozen. That’s not a good sign! To be fully honest, you’d kind of always thought you were above all the perverts and miscreants who post on Reddit, but worryingly, it’s starting to look like you might actually be more wretched and hopeless than all of them. You thought you were a relatively normal person, but it now instead seems like you might be some kind of singularly abominable mutant who defies all medical understanding.   Oh, no. This is very distressing.  We really don’t know what to recommend at this point. You could try searching for answers in one of those random-ass, 1995-looking bodybuilding forums or Diva Cup online communities that sometimes come up when you Google health stuff, but if that doesn’t work, you’re probably shit out of luck. In any case, you should probably get to a doctor ASAP, because something is very, very wrong with you. Jesus Christ. We’re really sorry."
Nature Is Incredible: Dad’s Belly Has Grown Out To Protect His Vital Organs From Predators,N/A,https://clickhole.com/nature-is-incredible-dads-belly-has-grown-out-to-protect-his-vital-organs-from-predators/,"After eons of evolutionary fine-tuning across millions of species, this may be one of the most ingenious adaptations Mother Nature has engineered yet: Dad’s belly has grown out to protect his vital organs from predators. Simply breathtaking! Over the past several years, Dad’s body has drastically changed in form to reveal a previously dormant defense mechanism—over time, his belly has gradually expanded in girth and developed additional layers of tissue and fat designed to shield his most vital organs from predators in the event of an attack. Though Dad’s formerly lean physique may have served him in his younger years, particularly during his search for a mate and his quest to provide for his offspring, his growing age has left him more vulnerable to carnivores, such as birds of prey, packs of dachshunds, and black bears. But, as evolution intended, his body is genetically prepared for this disadvantage, developing a fattier torso to compensate for his waning ability to escape or fight off animals that see him as food. To observe his hairy, jiggly paunch bloom outwards as his metabolism slows and he chooses to engage in less and less physical exertion each year is to observe nature at its most magnificently clever. Dad’s innate instinct to make poor dietary choices, consuming vast quantities of potato chips and hazy IPAs, also plays its role in his defense: In the event that a house cat does sink its teeth into Dad’s potbelly, it will likely be too deterred by Dad’s immense lard deposits to continue feasting into his abdomen. Now, if Dad is ambushed by a hawk or a fox while taking out the trash, he can count on his overhanging front-butt of a stomach to serve as a fleshy safeguard for his precious heart, lungs, and liver. What a profound testament to our genetic code’s ingenuity and endless adaptiveness. Astonishing! It’s biological marvels like Dad’s belly that inspire people to enter the field of evolutionary biology. How could you fault someone who sees Dad’s beer belly and believes it is the product of intelligent design? Yet again, nature has proven itself to be our planet’s finest engineer."
"Clarity Win: The Director Of The New Sonic Movie Just Corrected Fans That The Movie Isn’t About Being Yourself, It’s About How Cool Sonic Is And How Sonic Is Fast",N/A,https://clickhole.com/clarity-win-the-director-of-the-new-sonic-movie-just-corrected-fans-that-the-movie-isnt-about-being-yourself-its-about-how-cool-sonic-is-and-how-sonic-is-fast/,"The internet can come up with some pretty wild interpretations of films and their deeper meanings, and one creator has decided to set the record straight about the true message of his art: The director of the new Sonic movie just corrected fans that the movie isn’t about being yourself, it’s about how cool Sonic is and how Sonic is fast. It’s nice to have that cleared up straight from the source himself! Addressing online speculation that the upcoming movie Sonic the Hedgehog 2 will be an allegory about the importance of authenticity and living life as the truest version of yourself, director Jeff Fowler took to Twitter to explain to fans that the film is actually saying that Sonic is an incredibly cool superhero who is so insanely fast that you almost can’t believe it—like, faster than any other animal and probably even race cars. Fowler teased multiple corroborating examples of Sonic being a complete boss and zipping around super quick to show that he is fast and amazing, further clarifying that while elaborate theories about Sonic discovering the intrinsic value of his own unique individuality might sound fun, his intent for the film has always been to show that Sonic is a rad little dude who loves chili dogs and darting all over the place at a zillion miles per hour. Citing fans’ wildly off-base conjectures about the first Sonic movie being a parable about the value of friendship, the director preemptively shot down some misconceptions he anticipates fans having about Sonic 2: Dr. Robotnik, for instance, does not represent the oppressive sameness of conformity, but rather is a bad ugly guy who sucks and cool Sonic beats up his dumb inventions since Sonic is the fastest guy ever. Fowler also warned fans not to misinterpret a few richly symbolic scenes where time appears to slow down but Sonic is still moving at a normal pace, doing things like checking his watch and performing stretches while a cruise missile sluggishly chases after him—these scenes, he explains, are meant to show that Sonic is even faster than regular fast stuff, which should make you clap when you see it because of how mind-blowingly awesome it is. This revelation is definitely going to challenge the preconceptions a lot of people have about the film. “I think most people see the trailer and think ‘Oh, this must just be another cookie-cutter action flick where the protagonist breaks free of constricting societal expectations and learns to embrace the inner beauty of the self,’ but when you look deeper you’ll find the film has a lot to say about how Sonic is so brave that he doesn’t get scared of huge robots and when he beats them I cheer out loud so Sonic can hear me and know that I’m his friend,” said Fowler, noting that in many ways his film is a response to modern cinema’s lack of scenes where neat and awesome Sonic runs so fast his cool red boots turn into fire and the bad guys know they’re in trouble because Sonic always wins against evil. “I make art about what’s important to me, and if just one kid out there sees my movie and thinks ‘Sonic the Hedgehog is the coolest dude around and not even a fighter jet could outrun him because he’d just wag his finger all cool and disappear over the horizon like WHOOSH,’ I’ll know I’ve done my job.” “So just to be 100 percent clear, the new Sonic movie has absolutely nothing to do with being yourself or any other crap like that,” Fowler continued. “It’s about how Sonic is a lightning-fast hero with badass spiky hair and a confident attitude to match. Seeing him run fast gets me so amped that I literally throw up sometimes, and I bet you will too if you see the movie. I believe with all my heart that Sonic is the coolest hero in the whole entire world!”  Wow, we love this way of looking at the new Sonic movie and can’t wait to see it ourselves.

Communication Is Key: This Dad Just Came Back From Getting Cigarettes To Tell His Family He Was Abandoning Them,N/A,https://clickhole.com/communication-is-key-this-dad-just-came-back-from-getting-cigarettes-to-tell-his-family-he-was-abandoning-them/,"Not every conversation in life is going to be easy, but the willingness to push through uncomfortable feelings and openly communicate your thoughts is always going to be worth it. Here’s a story about a man who proves what a difference taking the time to have a conversation can make: This dad just came back from getting cigarettes to tell his family he was abandoning them. What a master class in effective communication! For the last couple of months, Pittsburgh resident Rick Walters has increasingly spent less time around his house, often staying out until the early hours of the morning, which caused his family to suspect that he’d one day just leave for good. So when Rick announced that he was heading out to the gas station to get cigarettes earlier tonight, his children feared that that was the final time they’d ever see their father without so much as a goodbye. Fortunately, though, Rick’s communication skills are way too advanced for a move like that: Rick came right back home with a pack of Marlboros, which he smoked as he told his family that he’d had enough of their bullshit and would be starting a new life without them! Now THAT is how it’s done! Way to go, Rick! While plenty of weaker or less empathetic people might take the easy road and just ghost their family without a proper explanation of why they were getting deserted, Rick proved his strength as an incredible communicator as he told his family that their dependence on him has made him feel trapped, and that his new girlfriend, Rayna, not only doesn’t complain about him, but actually respects him as a man, and so he would be taking off with her in a couple of hours. As Rick packed up a suitcase with his belongings, he even took the time to respectfully listen to his wife and kids’s appeals to him to stay, and while their attempts were unsuccessful, the fact that Rick made them feel heard before he said, “Sorry, but once Rayna gets here on her motorbike, I’m never thinking about you all again,” goes a long way. Amazing! It’s so nice that Rick’s family won’t have to spend the rest of their lives wondering why their father left since they know definitively that it’s because he found them to be whiny, annoying, and good for nothing. Even when the truth hurts, it’s just nice to know that someone respected your time enough to be upfront with you. Well done, Rick! Good luck “out west”!"
"Damn, Dude, You’re Like 36: This Man Is Trying Way Too Hard To Make His Hickey Be Seen By Everyone In The Office",N/A,https://clickhole.com/damn-dude-youre-like-36-this-man-is-trying-way-too-hard-to-make-his-hickey-be-seen-by-everyone-in-the-office/,"Brace yourself, because the following story is definitely going to make you cringe: This middle-aged man is trying way too hard to make his hickey be seen by everyone in the office.  Damn, dude, you’re like 36. Stop embarrassing yourself.  Even though he’s long past the age where it’s socially acceptable to even have a hickey, let alone be proud of one, Ben Packer of Baltimore, MD has been sitting at his desk all morning with his head tilted way back so that he can show off the bright red bruise on his neck to all of his surrounding coworkers. Although the hickey is pretty much unmissable, every few minutes Ben’s been getting up from his desk to walk around the office, where he continues to weirdly lean his head back to make sure the hickey is front and center as he parades it around. God, this is pitiful. You’re not in 8th grade, dude! Literally no one is impressed. Ben made things even more uncomfortable when he sidled up next to some coworkers in the kitchen and basically started framing the hickey with his hands, saying, “If anyone’s wondering why I’m wearing the same shirt as yesterday, it’s because I didn’t sleep at home last night”—clearly thinking his peers would be wowed by the implication of a sexual encounter. However, none of his coworkers took the bait and asked about his hickey, which unfortunately did not deter Ben, who then doubled down by adding, “Tinder girls are crazy, man…things got pretty wild,” while not-so-subtly gesturing at the fucked-up blotch on his neck.  Jesus, what a depressing scene. You’re an adult man, for crying out loud. Guys your age are starting families, and you’re proud of a hickey? The only way a hickey should make you feel is ashamed. Shit’s not appropriate. Pull yourself together, dude, and start behaving in a manner befitting a professional workplace. "
Incredibly Lucky Catch: Reddit Users Likely Saved This Man’s Life After Pointing Out That His Photos Showed He Had A Gunshot Wound,N/A,https://clickhole.com/incredibly-lucky-catch-reddit-users-likely-saved-this-mans-life-after-pointing-out-that-his-photos-showed-he-had-a-gunshot-wound/,"What was supposed to be just a casual post on social media may have inadvertently helped one man avoid disaster thanks to the timely intervention of some eagle-eyed strangers: Reddit users likely saved this man’s life after pointing out that his photos showed he had a gunshot wound. Who knows what could have happened if these internet heroes didn’t catch this when they did? Reddit user u/WheelinDealer83 thought he was just showing off his wheels when he posted on the site’s popular r/motorcycles subreddit earlier this week, but other users quickly jumped into action when they noticed a more serious matter on display in his photos.  A series of diagnostic questions confirmed that something was indeed amiss.  While u/WheelinDealer83 was initially untroubled by the discovery, others helped bring him around to the potential urgency of his situation.  u/WheelinDealer83 then went radio silent while his concerned fellow Redditors anxiously waited for news, but thankfully he checked back in two days later to share a happy ending to his story: “UPDATE: Just got back from the hospital, and it turns out you guys were right! I had been shot in the chest with a .357 round and had lost almost 2 pints of blood, plus had a collapsed lung. Doctors told me I was lucky I came in when I did, and I told them it was all thanks to the best bunch of motorcycle lovers on the internet. Thanks so much to all of you for looking out for me and my health!” Incredible! Maybe the internet isn’t such a bad place after all. It’s amazing to see people show such concern for a complete stranger’s wellbeing. Kudos to the Good Samaritans of r/motorcycles for catching this guy’s gunshot wound before it could get any worse!"
His Gift Is His Curse: This Auctioneer Is Talking Too Fast For Anyone To Understand That They Forgot His Birthday Yesterday,N/A,https://clickhole.com/his-gift-is-his-curse-this-auctioneer-is-talking-too-fast-for-anyone-to-understand-that-they-forgot-his-birthday-yesterday/,"While our gifts are often what define us, they can also destroy us, which is sadly something that one man from Bayard, Nebraska is now learning the hard way: This auctioneer is talking too fast for anyone to understand that they forgot his birthday yesterday. God, poor guy. Cattle auctioneer Harlan DuBois has never been one to make a big deal out of birthdays. Yet as he turned 58 years old yesterday, and the day passed by without a single family member, coworker, or friend reaching out to wish him well, Harlan couldn’t help but feel heartbroken. Making things worse, his spirits took yet another hit this morning, when his attempts to inform loved ones that they’d missed his special day were only met with confused nods and blank stares, as no one could make enough sense of his mile-a-minute speaking cadence to figure out what he was saying.  “Heyyyyyyyyy, 5-8, 5-8, 58yearsoldandnocardnocallsnonothingspentmybirthdaywatchingTVanddrinkingallalone, c’monnowc’mon, canIgettasimplehappybirthdaytexteven—ONETEXT, DOIHEARONETEXT!

Still unable to get a single “Happy birthday” out of them, Harlan eventually just gave up and went off to his recliner to sulk.  Poor guy. Maybe he should just write his thoughts out for them on a Post-It or something? While Harlan is indisputably a talented auctioneer, it’s moments like these when his gift probably feels more like a curse. It’s a hard cross to bear. Here’s hoping that Harlan finds a way to communicate his feelings to his loved ones sooner than later so that they’re able to make his next birthday a better one."
"Incredibly Romantic: When This Woman’s Boyfriend Had A Long Day At Work, She Surprised Him With A 45 Minute Explanation About How She Microwaved A Sweet Potato For Lunch",N/A,https://clickhole.com/incredibly-romantic-when-this-womans-boyfriend-had-a-long-day-at-work-she-surprised-him-with-a-45-minute-explanation-about-how-she-microwaved-a-sweet-potato-for-lunch/,"When you know your partner’s stressed, giving them a heartfelt surprise is a great way to let them know how much you love and care for them. Case in point: When this woman’s boyfriend had a long day at work, she surprised him with a 45 minute explanation about how she microwaved a sweet potato for lunch. OMG, this is sooo thoughtful! Little did Boston lawyer Peter Harrington know that when he got home from a grueling 12-hour day working on a case that could free a wrongfully imprisoned inmate, his girlfriend Lana would be on the couch, ready to deliver an incredibly detailed story about how earlier that day she came across a recipe for baked sweet potatoes, which would take up to an hour in the oven, and then realized that she could do it so much more quickly in the microwave. It was seriously like a scene straight out of a romance novel when, before Peter even had the chance to hang up his coat, Lana was already explaining how she mistakenly put the sweet potato in the microwave before remembering that she had to puncture it with a fork first, which she knew from microwaving regular potatoes, and how the sweet potato might have actually come out really badly if she didn’t remember just in the nick of time.  Okay, someone give Lana the girlfriend of the year award, because this is seriously too cute! After going off on a tangent about how she killed time while the sweet potato was in the microwave by researching whether or not sweet potatoes and yams were the same thing (turns out they’re not—there are several differences, which she expounded on in great detail), Peter clearly thought she was done spoiling him and got up to use the bathroom. But much to his surprise, when Peter returned to the couch, Lana proceeded to spend the next 25 minutes talking about how she cut into the potato once she thought it was done, but because it was still a little bit hard, she had to keep putting it back in the microwave for 30 seconds at a time until it had the perfect texture.  Wow. Peter is basically the luckiest guy ever! More impressive is the fact that Lana didn’t even have to ask Peter how his day went to know he needed to be treated to a thoughtful gesture like hearing about how, because Lana decided on her own accord to put red pepper flakes and flaky sea salt on her sweet potato, she figured she could pretty easily become some kind of cooking influencer if she posted about stuff like this on Instagram. And as an adorable finishing touch on the evening, Lana capped off her story by asking Peter if he could go get takeout from their favorite restaurant, since she was so excited about the sweet potato thing that she totally spaced out on dinner! Relationship goals!!!!! Gee, must be nice to have such an incredibly thoughtful and supportive partner. Here’s hoping someone does something like this for us the next time we’re feeling overworked!"
Odds Are Completely Fucked: The Dude-To-Gnome Ratio At This Party Is Way Off,N/A,https://clickhole.com/odds-are-completely-fucked-the-dude-to-gnome-ratio-at-this-party-is-way-off/,"Well, this fucking SUCKS. If you were hoping to get laid at tonight’s Sigma Chi rager, we’re sorry to say you’d better quit fluffing your dick and head to some other party in UT-Austin’s Greek scene, because the odds here are completely, utterly fucked: The dude-to-gnome at this party is way, way off.  There’s, like, six dudes for every gnome that came to this party. FUCK.  Even though the pledges working the front gate weren’t supposed to let any guy in unless they had three gnomes with them—a MINIMUM of three gnomes, not that hard to understand!!!—somehow, it’s become a goddamn sausage fest (stupid fucking cargo-shorts-wearing pledges are going to get their asses hazed tomorrow, that is for damn sure). For real, there are only, like, five gnomes here! And two of them are dating guys in the frat, so only three of them are even available. FUCK! What’s worse is that not a single gnome looks like they’re having a good time either. They’re just standing around texting, twirling their long gray beards, probably letting all their gnome friends know this party is a total bust. None of the gnomes have even taken off their pointy red hats, like they’re ready to split the moment they hear of a better party going down in West Campus.  You can’t blame these gnomes for avoiding the dance floor when it’s just a sea of guys out there. Although there is one gnome grinding with two guys at once. Maybe that’ll encourage the other gnomes to loosen up and join them? Then again, that gnome’s being super fucking slutty, and the way he’s guiding both frat brothers’ hands under the big belt buckle around his waist is just trashy as hell. Not a good look if we want quality gnomes coming to this party.  Seriously. This shit’s a problem.  If more gnomes don’t show up soon, the rest of them are going to leave. And then no one’s hooking up with any gnomes tonight.  Word going around is that all the gnomes are heading over to Delta Tau Delta’s rager tonight. The rich fucks apparently shelled out and got Chiddy Bang to perform in their backyard. How are we going to compete with that?! Chiddy Bang is going to get his dick wet inside a dozen, perfect 10 gnomes tonight, and we’re going to be over here, drinking lukewarm Keystones and playing Beerio Kart like some freshman geeds once everyone ditches in search of better parties— Oh, great. Fucking great. The slutty gnome on the dance floor just went into the bathroom with both guys, so that’s one less gnome you can shoot your shot with.  Honestly, it might just be time to cut your losses and leave. Even if a bunch of gnomes showed up right now, they’d turn around as soon as they saw how whack the vibes are here. Let’s just hope word doesn’t get around to other gnomes about how lame this party was, ‘cause otherwise we can kiss our chances of fucking a gnome goodbye for the rest of the semester."
About Time: Twitter Is Finally Putting A Disclaimer On Every Tweet To Remind Users That All Tweets Are Kind Of Stupid,N/A,https://clickhole.com/about-time-twitter-is-finally-putting-a-disclaimer-on-every-tweet-to-remind-users-that-all-tweets-are-kind-of-stupid/,"In recent years, social media has devolved into a cesspool of misinformation, harassment, and other bad behavior, but it finally looks like one major platform is taking action to get things under control: Twitter has announced they are adding a disclaimer to every tweet reminding users that all tweets are kind of stupid.  Yes! This is a huge step in the right direction.  The official Twitter account announced the new policy earlier today, explaining that from now on the disclaimer will be issued with every Tweet posted to the site, whether it contains outright misinformation, bullying, a meme oversimplifying a complex sociopolitical issue with the caption “THIS,” an observation about how men will go to extraordinary lengths to acquire a PS5 but won’t go to therapy, or any other expression of the ass-brained nonsense that’s become inherent to the format. The disclaimer will also be retroactively added to every Tweet ever posted.  “If it’s on Twitter, it’s pretty stupid,” said Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal in a press conference this morning, citing examples such as Tweets pitifully begging for help getting a user up to 10,000 followers, or Tweets starting with “Something we don’t talk about is” followed by a description of something everyone talks about literally all the time. “So we decided there’s no reason to try to sort out which Tweets are harmful when, by the very nature of being in Tweet form, they are all automatically a little dumb. We felt that if we are going to claim that we value and respect our users, it’s important to remind them of this each and every time they see a Tweet.” When a user clicks on the new disclaimer, they’re redirected to the following detailed explanation: “Twitter reminds our users that all Tweets are kind of stupid. The character limits force them to be truncated in weird ways so the wording is always awkward and they all sound arrogant and self-important. The majority of Tweets posted to the site do not contain any original ideas but instead typically either present a stale observation using a novel format that’s already been beaten to death or just outright steal and reword someone else’s opinion to make it seem like the user thought of it on their own. Further, the long multi-part threads which have gained popularity with science and political accounts in recent years pretty much defeat the entire purpose of Twitter, which is to keep things short, and they distill analyses of incredibly complicated societal issues into crass, sensational snippets that prioritize virality over sound reason. Anyone who primarily gets news and information from Twitter is an idiot, or at the very least an avid consumer of idiocy. This is not a place to go to become smart or well-informed. This is Twitter, a place for idiots.” Wow! By simply reminding users that Tweets are intrinsically asinine, Twitter is taking a huge step towards correcting many of the urgent problems that currently plague social media. Kudos to Twitter for looking out for the welfare of its users and helping them realize just how stupid everything is. Here’s hoping Facebook and other social platforms will follow suit!"
Yikes: Fargas The Foreign-Exchange Student Just Casually Revealed He’s Been Having Sex Since He Was Like 12,N/A,https://clickhole.com/yikes-fargas-the-foreign-exchange-student-just-casually-revealed-hes-been-having-sex-since-he-was-like-12/,"If you happened to be in Ms. Tobier’s fourth period health class today, consider yourself lucky, because you had a front-row seat to what will surely go down as one of the most jaw-dropping moments in Okaw Valley Central High School history: Fargas the foreign-exchange student just casually revealed to the class that he’s been having sex since he was like 12.  Yikes. He just came out and said it so nonchalantly. Not even bragging. Like, he said it as if full-on sex is perfectly normal for kids where he’s from.  Ms. Tobier was going through a lesson about the childbirth process, and as the topic of infant circumcision came up, Andy Quijano and Ezra Klemow began snickering and cracking jokes about how weird foreskin is. Then, in a fucking wild card move, Fargas was compelled to declare that he’d had sex with many girls and none of them minded that he was uncircumcised—an insanely out-of-left-field factoid to volunteer, and one that instantly caused the class to burst out in laughter, as he not only openly described his uncut penis but also his highly precocious usage of it.  With the class riled beyond Ms. Tobier’s control, Dylan Parde immediately started grilling Fargas as to the nature of his illicit encounters, clearly astounded to learn that the shy, oddly dressed, thoroughly unassimilated Eastern European teen—by no means a ladies man, at least here in America—might actually be the most sexually experienced kid in the entire school. And casually as all hell, with zero hesitation whatsoever, Fargas then revealed that he’d “had numerous lovers” in his home country right up until he came to America back in seventh grade. Stunned, Shavonne Young then yelled from across the room, “Wait, you were getting laid when you were 12?!?” which Fargas replied to with a nonchalant shrug and a nod, not understanding why all his classmates seemed so scandalized. Not even the fucking health teacher knew what to say after that. Ms. Tobier attempted to ignore Fargas and redirect the focus back to her lesson, but it was too late: The more everyone registered what Fargas had said, the more it shook their image of Fargas and wherever he came from. Like, yes, one could’ve probably gathered that he came from a more liberated culture, seeing how he gets fully naked when changing in the locker room after gym and doesn’t seem to feel any shame despite sporting a truly insane bush, but no one could’ve imagined that this kid who wears the same Marco Belinelli jersey and weird capri-type pants and BMW-branded backpack every day was actually low-key a sex machine. And things only got more astonishing, as Fargas, when asked by Dave McNally about who he lost his virginity to, coolly described a rendezvous with a “woman” living in his apartment building back home who “many of the boys in my town would go to.” He starting going into even juicier details, but Ms. Tobier quickly shushed him and attempted to resume the lesson—not that anyone could possibly pay attention after learning that the quiet kid previously known only for busting his head open in P.E. was straight-up fucking while most of his peers were still busy with pre-algebra.  Fargas, my man…what the FUCK.  It should be noted, too, that Fargas seems to be VERY religious—either a Muslim or a Catholic from one of those sects where the priests dress like wizards, no one can quite tell. So everyone just sort of assumed that he was just a straight-laced, goody-goody sort of dude who’s really into computers and soccer. But turns out he’s been a bona fide freak all along. Goddamn. Guess you really can’t judge a book by its cover! "
The Ls Keep Coming For Ye: Mr. Bean Just Texted Kanye A Video Of Himself Having Goofy Sex With Kim Kardashian,N/A,https://clickhole.com/the-ls-keep-coming-for-ye-mr-bean-just-texted-kanye-a-video-of-himself-having-goofy-sex-with-kim-kardashian/,"The fallout of Kanye West and Kim Kardashian’s divorce has been a spectacle with no shortage of public drama, bitter press statements, and new love interests complicating the situation even further. Unfortunately for Ye, he’s just taken the biggest L of the entire ordeal: Mr. Bean just texted Kanye a video of himself having goofy sex with Kim Kardashian.  Yikes…poor Kanye. Earlier today, Kanye was busy in the studio with Travis Scott and Future when he suddenly received a video message from Mr. Bean without any context or accompanying texts. After pressing play, Kanye’s face contorted with outrage and confusion as he watched the footage of a scrawny, nude, white man with a turkey on his head motorboating his ex-wife.  Only after Kim yanked the turkey off the man’s head—resulting in a wet POP that sent Kim flying backwards across the room onto a Murphy bed, which then sprung back up vertically against the wall with Kim still in it—did Kanye realize that the man in the video was none other than Mr. Bean himself, having goofy sex with Kanye’s ex-wife. According to sources in the studio who saw the footage, Mr. Bean looked directly into the camera with a grin, his fingertips excitedly wiggling, then raced over to begin several failed attempts at freeing Kim from Murphy bed, accidentally folding her back into the wall no fewer than six times. Producers did their best to calm Kanye, who allegedly began storming around the booth and shouting about how Bean was a “fake friend,” his eyes glued on the video as it reached a part in which Mr. Bean became flustered putting on a condom and ended up with his whole leg stuck inside it. Kanye was said to have held out hope that Bean’s ineptitude with the contraceptive meant Kim and Bean’s silly intercourse wouldn’t go any further, but that hope was short-lived.  Around the 11 minute mark of the footage, Bean got the condom on by having Kim hold it open as he dove onto it from atop several precariously stacked chairs next to the bed, bonking his head on a ceiling light fixture and electrocuting himself in the process.   By the time Ye watched London’s most socially inept mute guy maneuver a teddy bear’s arms to investigate and poke at Kim’s buttocks, appearing unsure what to make of it, the session was chalked up as a loss. Sources say Kanye was no longer in any condition to make music.  “How could she do this to me—the mother of my children!” Kanye exclaimed as he slumped to the floor, unable to believe his ex would share such wacky intimacy with Mr. Bean. The hip-hop artist’s friends say his heart hit rock bottom only when a baffled, nervous Bean treated penetration like he was dipping his toe in a swimming pool he was afraid to dive into—his facial expressions morphing from fear, to curiosity, to pleasant surprise, to foolishly over-the-top pleasure once he finally got the hang of it.  Thankfully for Kanye, the video ended soon after that, as Mr. Bean and Kim both finished at the same time—Bean’s face dropping in horror as Kim moaned and writhed in ecstasy, under the impression he’d done something wrong. The final seconds of the footage show Bean then tip-toeing out of the room and sprinting into the street in broad daylight, completely nude. Oof. That is the last thing Kanye needed to see right now. The sight of Kim basking in Mr. Bean’s grunting, wiggling, and socially unconventional sexual behavior are going to be living Kanye’s head for a long, long time. Let’s hope he can move on from Kim soon, otherwise their split is only guaranteed to be an even longer, more painful process for everyone involved. Hang in there, Ye!"
Sorry You’re Here: The Happiest Days Of Your Life Probably Don’t Involve Going On The Computer,N/A,https://clickhole.com/sorry-youre-here-the-happiest-days-of-your-life-probably-dont-involve-going-on-the-computer/,"All right, there’s no need to panic and log off when you hear what we’re about to say, but it is something we want to bring to your attention so you can keep it in mind while you continue surfing the Internet: The happiest days of your life probably don’t involve going on the computer. Sorry, but that’s just true. We don’t mean that today’s going to absolutely suck for you, but there’s a good chance that it’s not going to be all that great.  Think of it this way: you’ve been spending like, 10 hours a day on the computer for two decades at this point, and pretty much all that time has just been spent scrolling around aimlessly or reading random crap, most of which you can barely remember at all. Maybe there was one really fun day that stands out in your memory from when you were younger and you were watching early YouTube videos with your friends, but for the most part, being on the computer is a sign that your day is going to be an average, barely memorable wash. You know that that’s the case, don’t you? We shouldn’t have to tell you this. If you’re hunched over a computer somewhere, you’re almost certainly not doing the kind of thing you’ll remember on your deathbed, like standing at the altar next to the love of your life, holding your child for the first time, or even just having a nice time at the beach. Honestly, the best thing you can hope to do on the computer is make a post that a bunch of dumb strangers retweet a thousand times, which might result in a mild feeling of accomplishment, but not much more than that. You could argue that there’s an exception if you’re the type of scientist who uses the computer to make earth-shattering discoveries that could change the course of human history, but let’s be real—if you’re looking at our website, is that really what you’re up to? Yeah, probably not. Sorry you’re here, then. The good news is that not every day can be one of the happiest days of your life, so you might as well spend the other ones on the computer. Since you’re already on our site, why not take this chance to play our awesome quizzes and clickventures? Sure, it’s not the same rush as say, hang gliding, or volunteering, or going on an incredible first date, but it’ll fill up a couple hours of your time. Enjoy!"
Protecting The Consumer: Pringles Will Now Require Two-Step Verification In Order To Open Their Cans,N/A,https://clickhole.com/protecting-the-consumer-pringles-will-now-require-two-step-verification-in-order-to-open-their-cans/,"Okay, this is a massive win for consumer safety standards. By embracing digital technology, one of America’s most beloved brands is going the extra mile to protect their customers: Pringles will now require two-step verification in order to open their cans. Outstanding! What an incredible way for Pringles to look after their customers! In a press release earlier today, Pringles touted the safety benefits of their new can design, which has been technologically overhauled to feature two-step verification technology and ensure that no one but the person who purchased the Pringles will be able to access the potato crisps inside. According to the company, each container of Pringles will now come with a unique QR code on the label. Following purchase, the customer will be required to download the MyPringles app on their mobile device, create a personal account using their email address and phone number, and then register their Pringles can by scanning its QR code. Once the customer is ready to eat the Pringles, they can simply log into their account and select “Unlock My Pringles,” at which point they will receive a text message with a temporary 12-digit code that is set to expire after three minutes. After connecting the can’s stainless steel, digitally powered lid to Wi-Fi and then charging it via the convenient USB port located on the bottom of the container, consumers can then plug the code back into the app to verify their identity. From there, the lid will beep loudly three times before mechanically unsealing itself.  The press release added that the process to close the Pringles container simply requires selecting “Lock My Pringles” in the MyPringles app and following the two-step verification process again.  Wow. There’s nothing more unsettling than the thought that someone’s getting into your Pringles without your consent. Hopefully now that Pringles is implementing two-step verification, that worry will become a thing of the past. “Pringles consumers will never again have their snacking experience marred by the nagging fear that their Pringles could be tampered with, or even stolen,” said Steve Cahillane, CEO of Kelloggs, Pringles’ parent company. “In the event that someone does try to illegally open another person’s Pringles, three failed log-in attempts will result in the can automatically locking for 24 hours. Further, any physical attempt to break open a Pringles can will trigger the digital-powered lid to emit a 90 decibel alarm signal while sending its exact GPS coordinates to local law enforcement. Your Pringles are now safer than ever before.” This is awesome. Clearly, Pringles is a company that cares about its customers!  Though the MyPringles app was unfortunately hacked this morning and over 10,000 users’ personal information has been compromised, this new technology is a promising step forward for consumer safety. Let’s hope other companies follow Pringles’ lead soon!"
Ending World Hunger: A New UN Initiative Aims To Teach Starving People That You Can Get All The Food You Want From A Vending Machine If You Have A Quarter On A String,N/A,https://clickhole.com/ending-world-hunger-a-new-un-initiative-aims-to-teach-starving-people-that-you-can-get-all-the-food-you-want-from-a-vending-machine-if-you-have-a-quarter-on-a-string/,"The United Nations has set a goal to achieve “zero hunger” globally by 2030, and while that benchmark may seem ambitious, the intergovernmental organization just hit upon a solution that may go a long way towards ending the global hunger crisis: A new UN initiative aims to teach starving people that you can get all the food you want from a vending machine if you have a quarter on a string. Wow! This could seriously change the lives of many of the impoverished people worldwide who struggle to feed themselves each day. Launched earlier this year, the “Quarter Trick Initiative” represents a global effort to educate hungry and malnourished people on how they can obtain virtually unlimited vending machine snacks by simply tying a quarter to a string and yanking it out of the vending machine after each use. The program, which piloted in Malawi, involves live presentations by UN workers, who use a portable vending machine to demonstrate how a person can obtain a veritable feast of Funyuns, Cheetos, Famous Amos cookies, and Welch’s fruit snacks, containing more than quadruple the calories most program participants eat in a week, with a little ingenuity and a nice, long piece of string. The educational program also emphasizes that vending machines are typically restocked weekly, meaning that participants should be able to eat as much as they’d like for the remainder of their lives as long as they don’t lose their quarter. This is fantastic. It could potentially help millions of people feed themselves using minimal resources and expenditures! “Lack of access to diverse, varied food items affects an estimated 690 million people currently experiencing hunger around the world—but thankfully, our Quarter Trick Initiative helps these undernourished communities pair up into teams so that one person can quickly and efficiently score dozens of different kinds of chips and Lifesavers while the other keeps watch to ensure that they aren’t caught using their doctored-up quarter to repeatedly fool the vending machine’s coin intake mechanism,” said a UN spokesperson involved with the initiative. “We estimate that people who implement the quarter-on-string system could achieve a healthy weight after just eight weeks of consistent use, given the cornucopia of high-carb, high-fat foods that will suddenly be available to them.” Wow. It’s so heartening to see that there’s an ingenious new idea that could help solve such a painful, intractable global issue. Has the UN just ended hunger permanently?! We’ve got to wait and see, but we must say we’re optimistic. Thank you, United Nations!"
Devastating: Barack Obama Just Visited The White House To Relive His Glory Days But No One There Even Remembers Him Anymore,N/A,https://clickhole.com/devastating-barack-obama-just-visited-the-white-house-to-relive-his-glory-days-but-no-one-there-even-remembers-him-anymore/,"There’s nothing worse than having to accept that you’re past your prime, and unfortunately, one Washington, D.C. resident recently faced that reality in a seriously humbling way: Barack Obama just visited the White House to relive his glory days, but no one there even remembers him anymore. Ugh, that’s got to be demoralizing. What a gut punch for Barack. It all started last week: Obama had been reorganizing his attic when he stumbled across an old box of keepsakes from his days as the 44th President of the United States, including a newspaper clipping with a photo of himself in the Oval Office looking youthful, happy, and full of purpose. Overwhelmed by nostalgia, he quickly became lost in old memories of his greatest presidential triumphs and personal highs, which served as a comforting escape from the unsatisfying, momentum-less life he felt he was living in the present. Obama then resolved to make a surprise visit to his former stomping grounds, 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, where he hoped to recapture a little bit of the glory he felt during the years between 2008 and 2016. However, as Obama arrived at the White House dressed in one of his old presidential suits—which didn’t quite fit him the way it did back in the days when playing basketball with celebrities and stressing over the fate of the nation kept him lean—he his hopes were soon dashed. No one bounded up to him with their arms outstretched as he’d expected, and for that matter, no one even seemed happy to see him at all. Instead, a tour guide directed Obama to the White Houses’s visitor entrance, where he was forced to stand in a 30-minute security line along with the rest of the public. Though Obama mentioned he used to be president to a White House security guard, figuring his former position as chief executive might help him bypass the visitor line, the guard only asked him to place his phone, wallet, and belt in a small plastic tray. “Yeah, yeah, lots of people been president before—everything out of your pockets, keep it moving,” the security guard replied curtly, barely looking up as he ushered Obama through a metal detector and then directed the former POTUS to lift his arms for a full-body pat down.  From there, Obama’s plans to wander the halls on his own and catch up with old chums like President Joe Biden were immediately crushed as he was forced to pay for a public tour of the premises. At one point along the tour, Obama saw Janet Yellen, an old appointee of his, standing in a roped-off room across the hallway. Obama waved and shouted, “Janet, it’s me! Barry!” to get Yellen’s attention. But when Yellen looked up at him, she didn’t seem to recognize the former POTUS and simply gave him a perfunctory nod.  The final blow to Obama’s morale came as his tour group passed a large portrait of Obama himself, and the guide didn’t even stop to explain its significance.  “That’s me,” Obama announced to a completely indifferent tour group, mustering what pride he had left in this final bid to receive recognition for everything he achieved during the halcyon days of his presidency. “I was elected President of the United States in 2008, and re-elected in 2012. I accomplished many important things during my administration, such as passing healthcare reform, ending the war in Iraq, legalizing same-sex marriage, and approving the plan that killed Osama bin Laden. My name is Barack Obama.” The tour group just smiled politely and then moved on after an awkward silence. A nearby custodian was the only person to acknowledge Obama’s comment.  “Hmm, ‘Barack Obama.” Name rings a bell—can’t quite place it, though,” said the custodian. “I’ve been working here 20 some-odd years. Hard to remember all the different people who come and go, so if you say you were president at some time or another, I’m sure you were, son.”  Yikes. This is absolutely heartbreaking. Obama must be feeling pretty crushed right now. To realize the mark you left on the White House is a lot smaller than the one it left on you, and that everyone else from your heyday as president has moved on with their lives and forgotten about you over time…oof. So brutally sad. Disappointment is bound to happen when you try to recreate the past, and unfortunately, Barack Obama just learned that lesson the hard way."
A Piece Of History: The Bass Amp That Gave Away Osama Bin Laden’s Position To U.S. Forces While He Was Teaching Himself To Play ‘Higher Ground’ By The Red Hot Chili Peppers Is Coming To The Smithsonian,N/A,https://clickhole.com/a-piece-of-history-the-bass-amp-that-gave-away-osama-bin-ladens-position-to-u-s-forces-while-he-was-teaching-himself-to-play-higher-ground-by-the-red-hot-chili-peppers-is/,"The U.S. military’s 10 year search for Osama bin Laden concluded on May 2, 2011, as Navy SEALS raided a compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan where they shot and killed the 9/11 architect. Now, a key memento from this historic manhunt is being put on public display for the very first time: The bass amp that gave away bin Laden’s position to U.S. forces while he was teaching himself to play “Higher Ground” by the Red Hot Chili Peppers is coming to the Smithsonian. What an incredible artifact. History lovers are going to be lined up around the block to see this! Starting next month, the National Museum of American History is set to exhibit the Crate BX50 DLX-2 2-Channel 50 Watt bass amp on which Osama bin Laden fatefully practiced the Chili Peppers’ cover of Stevie Wonder’s “Higher Ground,” giving away his own location when the volume of his amateur attempt to replicate Flea’s bass line attracted the attention of a Pakistani intelligence officer living nearby in Abbottabad. This anonymous source tipped off American forces soon after confirming bin Laden as the bass player, providing U.S. intelligence officers with video and audio recordings of the al-Qaeda leader getting frustrated with himself while struggling to imitate the song’s iconic bass line using a pick after his fingers got tired from trying slap bass.  Now declassified, Smithsonian viewers can observe the video surveillance for themselves on monitors inside the exhibit. The recordings feature chilling private moments between the most wanted man in the world and his bass, including raw footage of bin Laden studying a YouTube tutorial made by a 13-year-old Chili Peppers fan who was able to slap through the entirety of “Higher Ground” in a single take, making Osama feel kind of embarrassed about how bad he was at bass in comparison. This unprecedented view into bin Laden’s final days in hiding will also include plaques with the Ultimate-Guitar.com bass tab he used to learn “Higher Ground,” as well as testimonials from his Abbottabad neighbors, who frequently complained to local authorities about the bass amp’s volume, citing how bin Laden would practice the song for hours on end in the dead of night, and how he did not get any better at playing bass no matter how often he practiced in the months leading up to his assassination. If you love U.S. history, you’re going to want to plan a trip to the Smithsonian ASAP! While Osama bin Laden’s personal Squire-brand beginner’s bass will be missing from this one-of-a-kind exhibit, as it was buried at sea with his body, that doesn’t make us any less excited! This extraordinary addition to the Smithsonian’s collection is going to provide a completely new perspective on one of the most famous manhunts in world history, and we simply can’t wait to see it. "
"That’s Fine, Man, Just Do Whatever: Fauci Has Announced That He’s Going To Start Spelling His Name Fauc!, Like P!nk",N/A,https://clickhole.com/thats-fine-man-just-do-whatever-fauci-has-announced-that-hes-going-to-start-spelling-his-name-fauc-like-pnk/,"Dr. Anthony Fauci has tirelessly led the nation’s pandemic efforts for almost two years, making call after call to keep Americans safe and healthy. Now, he’s just made another big decision—one that we don’t quite understand, but seems generally fine: Fauci has announced that he’s going to start spelling his name Fauc!, like P!nk. Huh. Well, at this point, all we can say is go ahead, Fauc!. Do whatever. In a Wednesday morning press briefing at the White House, the chief medical advisor previously known as Fauci announced that he’d filed a petition at a D.C. court to legally change his name to ‘Anthony Fauc!’, with an exclamation point in place of the ‘I’ that had once appeared in his last name. “Inspired by the artist P!nk, whose badass, take-no-prisoners attitude I’ve long admired, I have decided that, beginning today, I would like to be known as Fauc!.” The doctor then unfurled a homemade banner, which featured the name “ANTHONY FAUC!,” with “(FKA Anthony Fauci)” in parentheses beneath. Um…sure, Fauc!. As long as you’re still taking care of all the coronavirus stuff you need to take care of, this is fine with us. You’ve earned it, we guess. Fauc! went on to explain that, though his name change will have no direct bearing on the way he informs the public about the C.D.C.’s latest pandemic guidance, he does hope it will give him “a little extra pizzazz,” which could potentially help him spread his message further. “With this name change, I have finally, truly stepped into my power,” he concluded. “Please get vaccinated, and if you are fully vaccinated, get your booster shot.” All right then. Fauc!’s choice to change the spelling of his name is not necessarily something we expected, but if it’s working for him, then more power to him, we suppose. We will spell it however he likes. Here’s hoping the pandemic ends in 2022!"
Missing The Mark: This Dad Trying To Bond With His Son At The Monster Truck Show Does Not Understand That His Son Would Rather Be Fucking the Cars,N/A,https://clickhole.com/missing-the-mark-this-dad-trying-to-bond-with-his-son-at-the-monster-truck-show-does-not-understand-that-his-son-would-rather-be-fucking-the-cars/,"Connecting with your child isn’t always easy, and it can be heartbreaking to feel as though the two of you are on completely different wavelengths. Sadly, that’s just what’s happening to one unlucky American father right now: This dad trying to bond with his son at the monster truck show doesn’t get that his son would rather be fucking the cars.  So sad. For a dad who’s doing his absolute best to forge a bond with his son, this guy is missing the mark in a pretty tragic way. Harold Park, 45, thought that the Monster Jam event in Louisville, KY would make for a great bonding experience with his 9 year-old son, Brian, who seemed extremely excited when Harold first told him he’d bought tickets. However, as the duo arrived at their seats and the monster truck rally began, Harold immediately felt that something was off. Eagerly glancing at his son to gauge his reaction to every obstacle jump and wheelie, Harold’s heart sank as he noticed that Brian was completely ignoring the monster truck stunts—instead, the boy had his lustful gaze trained on the long row of dilapidated cars in the center of the arena, his mouth hanging open as he breathed heavily.  “That was so cool, right?!” a perplexed Harold asked Brian with performative enthusiasm after a monster truck did a backflip off an enormous ramp. But Brian only mumbled a not-so-reassuring “mhm” in response, his mind deeply preoccupied with erotic fantasies about spoiling the junk vehicles with carnal pleasure—burying his face in the airbags, kissing the rearview and sideview mirrors an equal number of times, stretching his whole body on each car’s hood and hugging it as tightly as possible, opening fuel door after fuel door with his mouth in a tantalizingly slow fashion.  As a monster truck lined itself up with the row of cars, revving its engine to amp the crowd up for the evening’s marquee stunt, Brian’s face grew grim. “I don’t want to see this anymore, dad,” Brian begged tearfully while tugging at his father’s shirt sleeve, privately desperate to avoid witnessing the objects of his sexual idolization become flattened heaps of metal and debris.  “Buddy, we’re gonna miss the best part—are you sure?” pleaded Harold, completely unaware that what most people would consider the highlight of the monster truck event would be, for his son, a horrifying erotic nightmare. Brian’s sobs only intensified, growing near-frantic as the monster truck’s front wheels rolled atop an old, rusted limousine—which, minutes ago, he’d fantasized about, vividly imagining himself sucking on the hood ornament of while humping its front bumper. Realizing Brian was deeply upset for a reason that went clear over his head, Harold had no choice but to bring the boy home early, kicking himself for failing to discern and support his son’s interests yet again.  Aw, what a letdown for both of them. Our heart goes out to this dad for trying! Even though the night didn’t turn out as he planned it, Harold’s heart was absolutely in the right place. He tried to connect with his son as best he could, and unfortunately, he just didn’t quite get there. Let’s hope Brian and his dad find something else to bond over soon!"
A Historic Find: Archeologists Have Discovered The Original ‘Faith’ Sign That Hung Above Jesus’s Toilet,N/A,https://clickhole.com/a-historic-find-archeologists-have-discovered-the-original-faith-sign-that-hung-above-jesuss-toilet/,"Okay, brace yourself, because an absolutely monumental discovery has just been made at an excavation site in Jerusalem: Archeologists have uncovered the original “Faith” sign that hung above Jesus’s toilet.  How cool is this?! What a historic find! An archeological team from Cambridge University had been excavating a settlement where Jesus is believed to have resided at some point in his life, when they happened upon a piece of rustic, wood-based wall decor, featuring the word “Faith” painted in fanciful cursive, in the remains of ancient latrine. Using radiocarbon dating to determine the piece’s age, as well as preserved stool samples also found at the site, researchers finally confirmed it belonged to none other than Jesus Christ after discovering the initials of his apostle Peter carved into the back of the sign, who biblical scholars have long  presumed gave the piece to Christ as a housewarming gift. Several other pieces of wall decor belonging to Christ were found at the dig—including a second sign that read “Sometimes I Put Wine On My To-Do List So I’ll Get One Thing Done”—but according to researchers, the “Faith” sign offers a particularly valuable insight into Jesus’ day-to-day experience using his personal toilet.  “The significance that this ‘Faith’ sign must have held for Jesus, serving as a reminder of his mission from God each time he used the bathroom, cannot be understated,” explained lead researcher Franklin Morris, emphasizing that the latrine’s worn condition suggests Jesus spent enormous amounts of time sitting on the toilet below the ‘Faith’ wall art, where he was likely  contemplating his own faith in the time leading up to his crucifixion. “This is a Holy Relic on par with the Shroud of Turin, the Crown of Thorns, and the ‘Home Is Where Mom Is’ framed canvas that Mother Mary was gifted at her baby shower. Make no mistake, we’ve stumbled into a profound artifact of Christian history.” Incredible. We literally have chills right now! It just goes to show that we still have so much to learn about Jesus Christ’s brief but impactful time on earth. Let’s give it up for these archeologists for making the find of the century!"
No Longer Science Fiction: Researchers Have Discovered A Kind Of Tart That Can Go In The Toaster,N/A,https://clickhole.com/no-longer-science-fiction-researchers-have-discovered-a-kind-of-tart-that-can-go-in-the-toaster/,"Every now and then we see something that reminds us we’re truly living in the future, and an astounding scientific finding just proved that the world of tomorrow is finally here: Researchers have discovered a kind of tart that can go in the toaster. Whoa. It might sound like the stuff of Star Trek or Blade Runner, but as of today, it’s reality. Earlier this morning, a team of MIT scientists made the groundbreaking announcement that they have identified a form of tart capable of being placed directly into the toaster, finally bringing about a civilizational leap that speculative fiction writers have dreamed of for decades. Though the researchers were quick to mention that there’s still a lot they don’t understand about these incredible pastries, they were able to perform a brief demonstration for stunned reporters in which one of the tarts was placed into a toaster and emerged several minutes later as a flaky-yet-gooey breakfast treat. Even better, the scientists explained that the apparent abundance of these tarts means this technology will be accessible to all of humanity instead of just a select few mega-billionaires as some sci-fi authors had previously conjectured. It’s hard to convey just how straight out of a Robert Heinlein or Octavia Butler story these tarts really are. A layer of space-age metallic foil keeps them in quasi-suspended animation until the exact moment of their toasting, suggesting that these tarts have conquered not only the toaster, but the very ravages of time itself—indeed, the sell-by dates on the boxes scientists first discovered the tarts in go as far out as 2023. The miraculous tarts also possess a sleek, futuristic form factor that somehow allows them to suspend jammy, flavor-packed fillings in stable equilibrium within a buttery yet somehow sturdy pastry carapace that never goes soggy, upending the laws of thermodynamics and the formerly inviolable concept of entropy to create a physics-defying paradox of textures in every bite. Perhaps most astoundingly, researchers have already identified over 30 molecularly unique configurations of the tarts—including one that’s distinctly evocative of brown sugar and cinnamon, as well as one that mimics the gastronomic experience of eating a s’more with eerie accuracy—meaning that these sophisticated little frosted cartridges can seamlessly imitate and replicate the entire known spectrum of fruitastic, chocolicious flavors like a magnificent prism refracting the sum of humanity’s achievements in dessert-making. “As soon as we saw the words ‘Heating’ and ‘For Toaster’ on those boxes, we knew we had made the discovery of a lifetime,” said Dr. Sarah Takemura, the lead researcher ushering humanity into a brilliant new era of breakfast technology. “As someone who grew up with her nose buried in the works of Asimov and Le Guin, I can tell you it meant a lot to finally fulfill their visions of a future in which the tart-lover is freed from the yoke of traditional pastry-making’s messy baking sheets, back-breaking hours of prep time, and unwieldy, dangerous ovens to be delivered unto an earthly paradise of toaster-ready delights. It really feels like jumping from the Middle Ages straight to The Jetsons. And while it’s too early to say for sure, we’re seeing preliminary indications that these tarts may also be able to go in the microwave and, if you weren’t feeling enough future shock already, perhaps even the freezer for a chilled dessert treat.” Absolutely mind-blowing. From the wheel to the electric light to the computer, humanity has finally arrived at the tart that can go in the toaster. Major props to these researchers for proving that our favorite works of science fiction may not be so fictional after all! "
It’s Scary How They Know This Much About You: Facebook Just Sent A Notification To Wish You A Happy Birthday,N/A,https://clickhole.com/its-scary-how-they-know-this-much-about-you-facebook-just-sent-a-notification-to-wish-you-a-happy-birthday/,"With each passing year, Facebook increases its stranglehold on our lives by mining our data and analyzing our every move online. And now, something eerie has happened that proves just how terrifying the tech giant’s insight into your existence really is: Facebook just sent a notification to wish you a happy birthday. Oh God. They know too much! When you woke up this morning, you expected your phone’s lock screen to be full of notifications from friends and family wishing you a fun day, but among those messages was something much more sinister: a missive from Facebook itself that read “Happy Birthday,” followed by your very own first name. It’s hard not to feel violated knowing that this powerful tech monolith knows such intimate information about your life as the date of your birth, and even worse, that it had the capability to connect itself to your personal telephone device and send unsolicited well wishes. And it’s obvious that this message was no fluke, as Facebook sent it at 9:00 on the dot on the morning of your birthday, clearly having pre-planned the notification to ensure it would reach you on your big day. This is very scary. It might finally be time to delete your Facebook for good. If Facebook has biographical details like your birthday on hand, there’s no telling what other information they might have dug up about you—the names of your parents, your birthplace, and even your current city and place of work may all be available to the nigh-omniscient corporation, which seems to have no issue hoarding your sensitive personal info and deploying it whenever they see fit. You might have thought of Facebook as a simple way to share pictures and connect with family members, but this birthday notification is proof that they’re not just providing you with a social media platform: they’re watching you. Wow. What a creepy story this is. We are really disturbed to find out how much Facebook has invaded our privacy. Someone needs to put a stop to this company, and fast!"
Weirdly Hurtful: This Man Wasn’t Offered A Flier He’d Spent The Last 30 Seconds Preparing To Turn Down,N/A,https://clickhole.com/weirdly-hurtful-this-man-wasnt-offered-a-flier-hed-spent-the-last-30-seconds-preparing-to-turn-down/,"Disappointment is a natural part of life, but one unlucky soul just experienced such an unprecedented ego blow that we really have to feel for him: This man wasn’t offered a flier he’d spent the last 30 seconds preparing to turn down.  Oof. What a weirdly hurtful letdown. When New Yorker James McNally, 33, spotted the Greenpeace volunteer handing out fliers across the street, he immediately braced himself to reject their climate change printout with a polite “no thank you.” James, mentally rehearsing for the interaction as he crossed the intersection, prepared to avoid eye contact, keep his hands in his pockets, and not stop walking when the volunteer attempted to solicit his attention—wrongly assuming he’d be approached like every other person passing this street corner. As James finally reached the corner, ready to shake his head and utter a curt “sorry,” the volunteer instead looked at him for a split second and turned away, apparently holding out for a different prospect while James did a double-take to confirm he’d indeed been passed over for some reason.  Though he absolutely did not want a flier, and would’ve thrown it away instantly if he’d be suckered into taking one, not being offered one in the first place was an indirect slight that James spent the rest of his commute turning over in his mind. Was it something about the way he looked, or something he was wearing, that made the volunteer assume handing him a pamphlet about climate change would be a waste of effort? Did he give off an unapproachable, or perhaps even hostile, vibe to strangers? Is he just the kind of person that you take one look at and think “that guy does not care about the environment at all?” Quietly reeling from such an unexpected cold shoulder, James couldn’t help but perform a mini-struggle session on himself. What he’d anticipated would be a short and slightly awkward encounter turned out to be a strangely insulting snub that’s now living in his head rent free. Yikes. This man has officially been cut down a size. Getting rejected in such an oblique way has got to hurt. It’s safe to say that James sense of self will be totally shaken for the next hour or so! Sorry about that, James!"
Pathetic: This Man Doesn’t Have The Stones,N/A,https://clickhole.com/pathetic-this-man-doesnt-have-the-stones/,"Some people can talk the talk but just can’t walk the walk, and one especially pitiful little chump is living proof that not everybody has what it takes: This man doesn’t have the stones. Time to run home to Mama, li’l fella. While we’d all hoped he might finally nut up and show some sack for once in his life, unfortunately it appears that this guy just doesn’t have the spunk, the moxie, or the chutzpah to make that happen. If you want to make it in this world you need grit, cojones, and respect, and this wimp wouldn’t know toughness if it came up and slapped the pacifier out of his mouth. Sorry to say it, but this thin-skinned, teary-eyed baby just hasn’t got the right stuff, plain and simple. Of course, it’s not just that this chump doesn’t have the huevos—he also doesn’t have the guts or the backbone, and motherfucker especially doesn’t have the heart. Someone without the stones can still get by well enough if they’ve got heart, but this chickenshit loser doesn’t even have that. Hell, we’re amazed he ever managed to swim out of his Daddy’s ballsack without someone holding his hand. If you were looking for someone with some actual brass ones on him, though, you’d best look elsewhere. Makes us fucking sick, this guy. A couple words of advice, buttercup: You need to toughen up, put some hair on your chest, and grow a pair, because playtime’s over and nobody’s gonna come and make it all better just because you don’t have what it takes. In this world, there are people who have the stones, and people who don’t, and right now you’re looking pretty damn clearly like someone who don’t. And you know what? We didn’t always have the stones. It’s true. But then the going got tough, we made a conscious decision to sack up and face the world head-on, and now we’ve got the stones. That’s what really separates us, cupcake. Stones, specifically the ones you haven’t got. What a pathetic little pushover this guy is. Let this be a lesson to anyone who thinks they don’t need to have the stones, because out here, that just isn’t how things work. "
Establishing Dominance: This Substitute Teacher Just Walked Up To The Biggest 6th Grader In Class And Beat The Shit Out Of Him,N/A,https://clickhole.com/establishing-dominance-this-substitute-teacher-just-walked-up-to-the-biggest-6th-grader-in-class-and-beat-the-shit-out-of-him/,"Substitute teachers often face disrespect from students, who use them as an excuse to slack off or misbehave. However, one sub in Kingston, NY just established the classroom pecking order right off the bat, sending a loud, clear, and brutal message about who’s running the show: This substitute teacher walked up to the biggest sixth grader in class and beat the shit out of him. Whoa. No one’s going to mess with this sub now. No way. As a regular sub at Terrill Middle School, John Turnbull, 38, knows how easily kids can get out of hand when their teacher is absent. That’s why Mr. Turnbull set the tone early for the 6th grade history class he’s subbing for today, calmly placing his messenger bag on his desk before making a beeline towards C.J. Manns—the biggest 12 year-old in his grade, standing at 5-foot-9 and 155 pounds—and asking the enormous pre-teen, “What are you looking at, you ugly fuck? We gonna have a problem?” Without waiting for an answer, Mr. Turnbull suddenly grabbed C.J. by his gel-spiked hair and slammed the kid’s head on the desk three times in a row until his nose was gushing blood. As C.J. slumped to the linoleum flooring, barely conscious, Mr. Turnbull slowly walked around the desk, delivered a bone-crushing stomp to C.J.’s hand, and then dropped a worksheet to the ground where the large sixth grader wept and groaned. “Your teacher Mrs. Atta isn’t feeling well today, so she would like you to watch the following video about Mesopotamia and complete this worksheet,” said Turnbull while passing out worksheets to the stunned class as they watched C.J. weakly lift himself up—only for Turnbull to pause with the handouts, drag the bludgeoned kid to the classroom entrance, and slam the door on his legs. “Failure to turn in this assignment by 8:50 will result in a 0 for your participation grade today.” Having asserted himself at the top of the class’s food chain, Mr. Turnbull proceeded to play the short video over the classroom projector, which every student is now watching obediently—including C.J., who can hardly see through the tears pouring from both of his swollen eyes.  And just like that, Mr. Turnbull had made an example out of his largest perceived threat in the classroom. Even though C.J.’s not a jock or a bully or anything—just a friendly kid who’s big for his age and plays trombone in the school band—his bloodied, beaten visage now serves as a grim warning to any of his classmates who’d dare undermine their substitute’s authority. No way in hell anyone acts up now! Mr. Turnbull’s methods may be unorthodox, but there’s no denying that they’re effective. Tomorrow, Mrs. Atta will probably be super pleased to hear how well her class behaved, and honestly, it wouldn’t be a bad idea for her to crack a troublemaker or two over the head to keep ‘em all in line.

A Beautiful Gesture: James Is Waiting 24 Hours After The Group Chat Learned Mike’s Dad Passed Away Before Sending An Octopus Memoji Video Of Him Farting So Fuckin’ Loud,N/A,https://clickhole.com/a-beautiful-gesture-james-is-waiting-24-hours-after-the-group-chat-learned-mikes-dad-passed-away-before-sending-an-octopus-memoji-video-of-him-farting-so-fuckin-loud/,"When a tragedy affects one of your friends, it’s essential to give them the space they need to grieve, and the following story is a heartwarming example of someone doing just that: James is waiting 24 hours after the group chat learned Mike’s dad passed away before sending an octopus Memoji video of him farting so fuckin’ loud. What a good friend!  Right after finishing his cold brew this morning (which always runs right through him), James felt a fart coming on—and a real juicy one at that—and managed to whip out his phone to record it with the octopus Memoji feature just in the nick of time, expertly capturing the foul, three-second ass-wail in all its moist glory. James immediately went to text the video to WeDemBoyz, the incredibly active group chat consisting of his nine best high school friends, but before he hit send, the chat received a message from Mike, who revealed that in the late hours of the night, his father suddenly suffered a heart attack and died. Even though James knew that his video was seriously gold because the octopus straight up kind of looks like him as it yells “got y’all an early Christmas gift!” before unleashing the mighty honk, he exercised incredible kindness and restraint by opting instead to send a message reading “Man I am so sorry to here [sic] that. Thinking of u brother.” As condolences for Mike flooded into WeDemBoyz, basically burying the hilarious photo Dylan sent last night of two dogs with visible red rockets humping a plastic Santa Claus statue, James continued to show the utmost concern for his grieving friend by resisting the overwhelming urge to blow everyone’s mind with what will surely go down as the most extraordinary fart video ever posted in the chat. Having watched the video at least 50 times now—taking special delight in how the octopus appears genuinely shocked by how loud the fart is—James knows that it would in all honestly probably cheer Mike up a little, but it would still nonetheless steal the spotlight from Mike’s dad, who the day should really be about. Hence, James is thoughtfully opting to hold off on sharing the once-in-a-lifetime fart vid until the day has passed, selflessly forgoing the guaranteed dopamine rush he’ll get from seeing the flood of “HaHa” reacts pouring in from his astonished pals.    What a beautiful example of the power of friendship! This just goes to show the ability each of us has to positively affect the people in our lives and demonstrate that we care. Fart videos may come and go, but true friendship lasts forever, and it’s important to remember that the little decisions we make today can leave a lifelong impact."
Can’t Blame Him: This Dad Skipped His Kid’s Baseball Game To Attend A Better Kid’s Baseball Game,N/A,https://clickhole.com/cant-blame-him-this-dad-skipped-his-kids-baseball-game-to-attend-a-better-kids-baseball-game/,"Parents have an obligation to attend their kid’s activities and show them support, but it can be pretty hard to do that when your kid’s not all that talented. That’s why no one can blame this man who chose to skip his kid’s baseball game to attend a better kid’s baseball game. Yeah, makes sense. We’d do the same if we were in his shoes.  Rochester resident Derek Miller’s fourth grade son Brandon really only excels at two things in baseball: bench-warming and striking out. So when Derek learned that his son’s winter league game this Sunday fell at the same time as a local travel team game featuring 9-year-old Little League all-star and five-tool stud Cameron Gerlach, it made sense that he opted to attend Cameron’s game instead, as no one in their right mind would pass up an opportunity to see a potential future pro play in order to watch their own child embarrass himself at the plate. The most exciting thing one could hope to see from Brandon is, at best, maybe a bunt single or an uneventful walk, whereas Cameron is already throwing pitches with visible break on them and is crushing extra base hits nearly every at-bat against pitchers two years older than him, making the choice between the two an absolute no-brainer.  Although this sadly meant that no one was there to cheer for Brandon when he went up to bat on Sunday, it was ultimately a small price for Derek to pay to get to watch legitimately exciting competitive baseball instead of the pitiful bush league nonsense that his son brings to the plate. Besides, once Brandon has kids of his own, he’ll totally understand why his dad chose to attend a game played by gifted, future D1 players in lieu of watching his own scoliotic offspring clomp around in an uncoordinated display of participation-trophy jackassery that no real sports fan of discerning taste would ever voluntarily subject himself to. After all, might as well not humor the boy, lest he delude himself into thinking he’s actually got some talent.  Damn. This decision could not have been easy for Derek, who knew that he wouldn’t be there to support his son on the off chance that he actually managed to catch a ball or something, but you can’t fault the guy for opting to attend an objectively superior spectator experience. Would you rather watch a game where every inning ends in a mercy rule because none of the kids are good at fielding? Or would you rather watch Cameron take a run at breaking the regional home run record? The choice is pretty clear, if you ask us."
Everything’s Meaningless: You Can Pretty Much Make A Big Dipper Out Of Any Stars,N/A,https://clickhole.com/everythings-meaningless-you-can-pretty-much-make-a-big-dipper-out-of-any-stars/,"A lot of stuff is just totally arbitrary make-believe that everybody kind of decided to agree on, and if you need any proof, just look up to the night sky: Turns out you can pretty much make a Big Dipper out of any stars. Seriously, it’s just a bunch of arbitrarily placed dots up there—you can imagine them forming literally any shape you want. Despite being one of the most famous constellations in the night sky, the Big Dipper is basically just four stars in a vague rectangle with three more stars off to the side of it, which is a pattern that occurs an infinite number of times given how many stars there are and how broadly we’ve defined the criteria for them looking like a dipper. While astronomers also recognize a single additional dipper, the Little Dipper, the truth is you could keep pointing out dipper shapes until the cows come home and nobody could really argue with any of them since it’s all fake to begin with. It’s not like there’s any hard and fast scientific way to test whether something’s actually a dipper or not, so how important is it that people randomly landed on these two as being the only official dippers? Case in point: Even though it was kind of cloudy last night, the couple dozen of stars that were visible were sufficient for one to piece together a good 20 or so Big Dippers just at a casual glance. You could also easily connect the dots to form a car shape, or the shape of continental Africa, or a vaguely Mr. T-like shape—whatever the hell shape you want, you can pretty much will it into existence. Honestly, given the infinite, highly detailed geometric combinations that one could sketch out in the vast, shimmering canvas of the cosmos, the fact that the most imaginative astral marker our ancestors could discern was a fucking cup is some real chimp-brain troglodyte shit. Those guys were obviously extraordinarily dumb, and it’s unclear why we continue to recognize their ass-brained interpretation of the stars and their endless pictographic possibilities.   Also, who the fuck even knows what a “dipper” is? Like, if someone told you those same stars were supposed to be a baseball cap or a flying kite, you wouldn’t second-guess them and say “No, these specific stars are definitely shaped like a dipper.” People would think you were a lunatic, and rightfully so, as what could be more batshit than adamantly insisting on a specific semblance of order in what is basically an everlasting expanse of random celestial noise?  Big Dipper or Little Dipper, it’s all fucking nonsense—tales told by idiots, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing. Let’s not pretend otherwise.   Indeed, there’s truly no point to any of this stuff. Here’s hoping people start realizing as much and stop lending credence to all this meaningless bullshit. "
Incredibly Insensitive: Everyone At This Coffee Shop Is Gawking At A 2-Inch-Tall Man Taking A Bath Inside A Teacup,N/A,https://clickhole.com/incredibly-insensitive-everyone-at-this-coffee-shop-is-gawking-at-a-2-inch-tall-man-taking-a-bath-inside-a-teacup/,"Get ready to lose your faith in humanity, because the infuriating situation going on in a local New Jersey cafe right now is proof positive that people can be incredibly cruel: Everyone at this coffee shop is gawking at a two-inch tall man taking a bath inside a teacup. How unbelievably insensitive. It’s not okay to stare at someone just because they’re different! Alistair Cabot, a two-inch tall, 54-year-old customer at the Coffee Box in Plainfield, NJ, has been minding his own business all morning, bothering no one as he bathes himself inside a tiny porcelain teacup placed on one of the cafe’s corner tables. Sadly, however, all the patrons and employees at the Coffee Box can’t seem to stop themselves from staring at Alistair as he scrubs his naked body with a loofah made from a toothpick and a cork, muttering among themselves as if he isn’t totally within earshot of all their rude comments.  When Alistair first noticed he was being ogled by no less than a dozen onlookers, he cleared his throat and stared unapologetically back, standing his ground as he raised a hand in the air and used his tiny bar of soap to scrub his underarm. As the impolite staring continued, Alastair briefly considered drying himself off and ending bath time early to avoid the judgmental glares, but ultimately he carried on exfoliating his tiny legs with a thimbleful of coffee grounds despite his audience’s perplexed looks. Unfortunately, the gaping only became more pronounced as Alastair went on with his bath, and as of 30 minutes into his morning bath ritual, everyone is still treating him as if he’s some sort of sideshow attraction instead of a pocket-sized human being simply cleaning his body in a cozy little teacup filled to the brim with soapy water.  After Alastair finished washing his hair, it appeared that he had had enough of the coffee shop patrons treating him as some sort of spectacle. “Take a picture, it’ll last longer,” Alistair bravely barked at a parent and child who were peering at him while waiting in line, standing up from the suds and raising his arms to present his whole tiny body in a defiant gesture of pride. “What? You’ve never seen a two-inch tall man take a bath before? Grow up.” Good on Alastair! Who the hell are these people to shame him? So disrespectful. Clearly, these spectators were too thoughtless to consider that Alistair’s size would prohibit him from bathing in a normal-sized tub, and that a teacup might be the perfect alternative vessel for his needs. Would they prefer that he remain covered in chimney soot just so they don’t have to feel ‘inconvenienced’ by the mere sight of a man the size of a field mouse taking a bath? To see someone like Alistair—whose only crime was maintaining basic hygiene while humming a cheerful ballad from the early 1900s—met with such cruel incivility from this cafe’s patrons is downright rage-inducing.  No near-microscopic man should be worried about taking a teacup bath in public. It’s always disheartening to see people lack such basic decency, but luckily, Alistair is courageously sending a message to all of his onlookers that their impolite gawking won’t stop him from enjoying his bath, as he is 100% entitled to do. Don’t let them get you down, Mr. Cabot!"
Again With This: The Love Of Your Life Would Like To Go Out and Do Something Tonight ,N/A,https://clickhole.com/again-with-this-the-love-of-your-life-would-like-to-go-out-and-do-something-tonight/,"Well, you can officially say goodbye to your plans to have a quiet night to yourself, because yet again, for some inexplicable reason, the love of your life would like to go out and do something tonight.  Unbelievable. It’s all the time with this shit, really.  Just as you sat down and turned on the TV after getting home today, your one true love decided it was a perfect evening to go into town and do something fun as a couple, as if you didn’t already hang out one night last week, and another night the week before that. Your kindred spirit apparently harbors a persistent and annoying desire to share intermittent experiences with you despite having already hung out with you LITERALLY DOZENS OF TIMES over the years, because simply going to a place that isn’t your house makes their heart light up or some nonsense like that, which is why they feel the maddening need to do it over and over again. It’s seriously beyond ridiculous. Been there, done that, ad infinitum.  Just cut it out with all this “spend quality time together” bullshit already! Like, first you had to meet your partner. Then you had to get to know them. Then you had to go through all the rigamarole of developing a loving, supportive relationship. And yet now, even though you’ve already gone through so many hoops to build a fulfilling, meaningful life with your soulmate or whatever, you’re still expected to keep doing additional shit on a—no exaggeration—weekly basis. It’s like, you’ve already fallen in love and committed your lives to each other and everything, so why keep beating a dead horse?  These occasional mutual activities are simply too much!  If this is what growing old with the person you love most is going to look like—getting dragged off the couch multiple times a month to spend time together in an endless Groundhog Day-like cycle—you may have to reconsider this whole arrangement, because it just doesn’t seem sustainable. Can’t your partner just leave you alone so you can love them in peace? All this ridiculous “quality time” and “affection” stuff is getting old."
Still Can’t Believe He’s Gone: This Christmas Will Be Our 455th Without Suleiman The Magnificent,N/A,https://clickhole.com/still-cant-believe-hes-gone-this-christmas-will-be-our-455th-without-suleiman-the-magnificent/,"People mostly think of the holidays as a joyful time, but they can also be painful reminders of those who have left us, and this upcoming season is going to be particularly hard for us to get through: This Christmas will be our 455th without Suleiman the Magnificent. Damn. It still doesn’t feel real sometimes. As excited as we are to spend this Christmas with those closest to us, the holiday just hasn’t felt the same since Suleiman the Magnificent succumbed to illness in his tent during the Ottoman Empire’s 1566 siege of Szigetvár in Hungary. Something about looking at the little stockings hung up over the fireplace and seeing the empty space where there should be a big fluffy green one for Suleiman the Magnificent just instantly undoes all the centuries we’ve had to process our grief. We haven’t been able to bring ourselves to take out the oversized Santa hat Suleiman the Magnificent used to put on over his turban during present opening, but we also can’t bear the thought of getting rid of it either. Even 455 years later, it’s still raw for us. As hard as we know the day itself will be, the entire Christmas season is an emotional minefield. We just know we’re going to see a nice stand mixer while out holiday shopping and absentmindedly think “That would be a perfect gift for Suleiman the Magnificent” before breaking down right there in the middle of the kitchen supply store. Hearing “Deck The Halls” play on the radio will stir up bittersweet memories of how Suleiman the Magnificent would always sing along in his rich, velvety baritone whenever the carol came on during one of his naval campaigns against the Portuguese for control of trade with the Mughal Empire. Hell, even just seeing eggnog at the grocery store will render us inconsolable as we remember the time Suleiman the Magnificent got so loaded on the stuff that he accidentally called his Circassian concubine by the name of his Ruthenian concubine and spent the next hour hiding in the bathroom in embarrassment. How can we be joyful when everywhere there are so many little reminders of Suleiman the Magnificent? We’re all hoping to avoid a repeat of last year when Mom asked when we’d be having some maple-pecan pie, only to remember that Suleiman the Magnificent had always been the one to bake them. Even in a best-case scenario, it’s all but inevitable that our four-year-old niece will ask “Where’s Suleiman the Magnificent?” at some point during the proceedings, meaning someone will have to gently explain to her that Suleiman the Magnificent’s body was transported back to Istanbul for burial at Süleymaniye Mosque while several of his internal organs were buried near Szigetvár at Turbék. And as awful as it sounds to say, we’re almost relieved that Grandma passed away this February—the thought of her dementia making her have to learn over and over that Suleiman the Magnificent’s 1566 death presaged an extended era of Ottoman decline is simply more than we could bear. God, Christmas just isn’t the same without him. You really just never know what you have until it’s gone. We’re still going to try to enjoy this Christmas as best as we can, but it’ll never quite feel right without Suleiman the Magnificent there to celebrate with us. RIP, Suleiman the Magnificent. We love you so very much."
So The Plan Is To Turn Him Into A Huge Pussy? The Teacher Who Stepped Up To Mentor This Troubled Teen Is The Biggest Chump On The Entire Faculty,N/A,https://clickhole.com/so-the-plan-is-to-turn-him-into-a-huge-pussy-the-teacher-who-stepped-up-to-mentor-this-troubled-teen-is-the-biggest-chump-on-the-entire-faculty/,"Get ready to shake your head in dismay, because one school in Paterson, NJ is taking a completely misguided approach to helping one of their students: The teacher who stepped up to mentor this troubled teen is the biggest chump on the entire faculty.  That’s the plan? To put him under the tutelage of a meek, middle-aged stooge who literally no one respects? Yikes. Marcus Green, a 16-year-old high school junior struggling with long-standing academic and behavioral issues, was recently the subject of an intervention by faculty of Eastside High School. In an effort to keep him out of trouble and prevent him from flunking out, guidance counselors paired Marcus with a staff mentor who would serve as a role model for Marcus and encourage him to make better life decisions. Inexplicably, however, the mentor they stuck him with was none other than Mr. Valentine: a schlubby, extremely religious chemistry teacher who is regarded as the biggest pushover in the school district and the punching bag of both the student body and, privately, his peers on faculty. This is the same teacher who wears orthopedic shoes every day and whose OkCupid profile was uncovered and widely screenshotted last year by his students, who ever since have been relentlessly quoting it and making fun of it to his face. Absolutely no one likes him or turns to him for advice, so it’s unclear why the hell anyone would think he’d be capable of reforming one of the school’s most notoriously disruptive miscreants.   Considering Mr. Valentine once cried in front of a class after an unruly student threw the framed photo of him and his brother that he keeps on his desk into a school toilet, and that his students make sport of loudly mocking his back sweat during class, it’s unclear how he’ll manage to turn Marcus into anything other than a dorky, red-faced doofus who’s too timid to stand up for himself, even against literal children. It became immediately clear that Mr. Valentine was out of his depth at his first sit-down with his troubled ward, in which he utterly failed to establish any semblance of authority over Marcus, who repeatedly dismissed his concerns and derided him as a “Mickey Mouse gay-ass” before abruptly leaving only three minutes into the meeting. And you can’t really blame the kid for leaving, either, as any prolonged association with Mr. Valentine is sure to make you a target for bullying. Honestly, even the 76-year-old custodian who doesn’t speak English would’ve been a better mentor for Marcus. Mr. Valentine is just that much of a chump. God, what a loser.  Poor Marcus. The kid definitely needs some guidance, but he’d become a social leper if word ever got out that he was spending extensive one-on-one time with Mr. Valentine. It’s a real damned-if-he-does, damned-if-he-doesn’t situation. Let’s hope the school figures out something else for this troubled kid, because absolutely no one wins under this current arrangement."
"So Sexy, Bernardo: Bernardo Just Told A Joke And Then Did A Flip",N/A,https://clickhole.com/so-sexy-bernardo-bernardo-just-told-a-joke-and-then-did-a-flip/,"Ladies, take out your fans and fan them on your faces, because a most exciting and sensuous spectacle has taken place: Bernardo just told a joke and then did a flip. So sexy! So Bernardo! It’s no secret that Bernardo is pretty much the most fawned-over stud in town—we all love his irresistibly sinewy legs, his devil-may-care mustache, his seductive, unblinking gaze, and the sexy way he walks backwards everywhere instead of forwards. But never has he left more people swooning than he did about half an hour ago, when he backwards-walked up to the patio at Noodles & Company with his sweatpants pulled up tantalizingly to his armpits and his lush eyebrows fastidiously penciled in, immediately attracting a crowd of eligible bacheloresses with his trademark greeting, “Mahalo to the ladies! I am Bernardo.” Clinging to his every word like doe-eyed schoolgirls, the women would soon find themselves unable to contain their desire for Bernardo as he unleashed one of his signature froglike cries to signal that he was about to deliver one of his famous comedic performances.  “JOKE,” Bernardo announced. “What is the similarity between a balloon floating in midair and a vagrant?” The ladies were screaming so loud they could scarcely make a reply. Bernardo stood with his legs wide apart and his arms in the goalpost position as he supplied the punchline. “The both have no visible means of support!” squealed Bernardo. “End of joke.” So sexy was Bernardo’s joke that several ladies grew faint and had to steady themselves  on the Noodles & Company’s metal stools so as not to collapse under the sheer force of his charm. But just when it seemed like things couldn’t get any more titilliating, Bernardo hushed the crowd, took an enormous breath, crouched down, and then launched into a perfect backflip, leaving his crowd of admirers stomping and pawing at the ground with pure, unbridled lust. “We love you, Bernardo!” they cried. “We love your gymnastics!” Bernardo is simply too hot to handle! Now that Bernardo has told his joke and done his flip, he is busy chugging cup after cup of the Noodles & Company’s free ice water and eating a small serving of buttered noodles amid a fawning swarm of ladies who can barely stop themselves from reaching out and touching his ravishing off-white button-up shirt. How lucky these women are to bear witness to this scene! Bernardo is truly the most gorgeous Bernardo in all of the world, and after seeing him tell a hilarious joke, do a perfect flip, and then slurp down a kid-size serving of Noodles & Company’s luscious buttered noodles, we, like so many others, have fallen head over heels in love."
Total Time Saver: Bumble Will Automatically Delete Your Account If There’s No One Out There For You,N/A,https://clickhole.com/total-time-saver-bumble-will-automatically-delete-your-account-if-theres-no-one-out-there-for-you/,"Searching through dating apps to try to find your soulmate can definitely drain your energy, but one online matchmaking service has stepped up with a new feature that’s about to save you a ton of time: Bumble will automatically delete your account if there’s no one out there for you. Awesome! This is going to make dating so much better! Starting next week, if you wake up to find that your Bumble account has been deleted, it means that their system has determined that no one is ever going to love you and that you are going to spend the rest of your life alone. Using a proprietary algorithm that analyzes a user’s looks, personality, emotional baggage, and general vibe, Bumble is able to determine with over 97 percent accuracy if a person is never going to meet ‘the one’ because for them ‘the one’ does not exist. “While in the past we’ve welcomed all adults to use our service, we’ve since realized that there’s no point in forcing our users to waste time online dating if they’re just going to wind up alone anyway,” said a spokesperson for Bumble in a press release. “We hope that by preventing unlovable people from using our app, they can instead spend their time with their married friends who’ll soon have kids in order to increase their chances at being named a godparent, since having a family of their own is obviously never going to happen.” If your account does get deleted, the dating app recommends that you don’t panic, and instead head over to your inbox, where you’ll see an email from Bumble with the subject, “It’s Okay! Hobbies Can Be Just As Fulfilling As Lifelong Romance.” This helpful final dispatch from Bumble contains a list of exciting activities, like rock climbing and playing the piano, that you can take up now that true love’s off the table. The company further explained that while they can’t stop former users from joining other dating sites, they strongly suggest that people accept their fate immediately, because the sooner they stop dating, the more it’ll seem like they actually enjoy being alone, which ultimately will come off as slightly less sad to everyone who knows them. Hell yes! This is seriously going to save people from spending years of their life messaging people on dating apps just to discover that nobody’s ever going to love them. What an awesome new feature. Your move, Tinder!"
"Honestly Not Important, But Still Kind Of Interesting: This Baby’s First Word Was ‘Bells And Whistles’",N/A,https://clickhole.com/honestly-not-important-but-still-kind-of-interesting-this-babys-first-word-was-bells-and-whistles/,"Look, we’ll be the first to admit that this is relatively inconsequential in the grand scheme of things, but it still seemed worth mentioning in a kind of “huh, what the fuck” sort of way: This baby’s first word was “bells and whistles.” That’s a pretty nuts thing for a baby to say straight out of the gate, right? After a comparatively uneventful stretch of putting together pre-verbal babbling sounds of no particular note, 11-month-old Jessica Michelson somehow managed to very clearly say “bells and whistles” last week despite that being way more complicated than 99 percent of other babies’ first words. Like, how often do you hear about a baby’s first word being an idiomatic expression that incorporates the figurative usage of words she hasn’t even said in a literal context before? That has to be pretty rare. Of course there are a couple hundred million babies on earth at any given time, so statistically you’d expect to see a few outliers now and then whose first words are some wacky shit like “over a barrel” or “baker’s dozen,” but still. It’s kind of like seeing an albino squirrel at the park—it’s not as though we thought it could never happen, and it’s not like it really changes anything for us or the world in general, but it’s still remarkable enough to merit a “whoa, check THAT out” level of response in the form of a gee whiz general interest article. It’s just kind of neat is all.  To be clear, this probably doesn’t mean that Jessica is some kind of genius superbaby, or even that she’s going to start putting together full sentences before other babies her age. It might just mean that her parents use the phrase “bells and whistles” a lot more than the average household and Jessica picked up on that in the way that babies are pretty much hardwired to do. In reality, this is probably just a weird accident with no deeper meaning, but in the way that a good political pollster should publish strange results that don’t necessarily follow prevailing trends, we feel it behooves us to tell you that this baby said “bells and whistles,” and you’re free to do whatever you’d like with that information. Oh! One thing that might be worth noting is the fact that Jessica said “bells and whistles” while playing around with the dedicated Roku button on her family’s living room TV remote, which actually would constitute an accurate usage of “bells and whistles.” Although babies mess around with stuff all the time, and many modern objects can be said to have bells and whistles, so it’s probably just a coincidence.  Still, pretty neat. Anyway, seems like we’ve unpacked everything there is to unpack here. We’ll follow up if we hear any updates, but honestly, we don’t think anything else notable will come of this. But hey, hope you found this at least a little bit fascinating. With all the troubling news we’re bombarded with every day, sometimes it’s nice to just hear about a baby doing something weird.  "
Thanksgiving Miracle! Dad Is Too Devastated By The Death Of His Brother To Fight Over Politics This Year ,N/A,https://clickhole.com/thanksgiving-miracle-dad-is-too-devastated-by-the-death-of-his-brother-to-fight-over-politics-this-year/,"No one took your uncle’s passing this summer as hard as Dad. But as sad as it’s been to see him grieving, every cloud has a silver lining, and today’s family Thanksgiving gathering proves it: Dad is too devastated by his brother’s death to pick fights over politics. Yes!!! Finally, a year without a blowout shouting match ruining Thanksgiving!  On any other Thanksgiving, Dad would make sport of instigating political arguments with relatives, habitually using the holiday as an opportunity to make smug Boomer jokes about people’s beliefs and regurgitate canned Fox News talking points that he thought made him sound smart. But this Thanksgiving—the first one since your uncle tragically died of pancreatic cancer—a bonafide miracle occurred: Dad is provoking absolutely no one, too lost in somber reflection over his brother being dead to goad anyone into a debate! Even when your cousin revealed that they joined the Democratic Socialists of America, and everyone waited with bated breath for Dad’s belligerent moron side to come roaring to life, it remained dormant to everyone’s relief, as Dad instead quietly drank beer on the sofa where he and his brother would watch football together in years’ past.  Things are just so much more pleasant when he is heartbroken! It’s unclear whether Dad will still be a mopey sad-sack come Christmas, so let’s all make sure to enjoy this civilized family get-together while we can—who knows if and when it’ll ever happen again. And while it’s a little bit of a bummer to see Dad feeling so down, the fact is that his crushed spirits have resulted in a major win for the rest of the family, and for that we are all grateful. If only Dad’s brother were still alive to enjoy this rare peaceful Thanksgiving!  "
D.C.’s Fashion Rebel! Kyrsten Sinema Showed Up To A Senate Vote Wearing A Leather Mask And Dangling From Hooks In Her Back,N/A,https://clickhole.com/d-c-s-fashion-rebel-kyrsten-sinema-showed-up-to-a-senate-vote-wearing-a-leather-mask-and-dangling-from-hooks-in-her-back/,"Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ) is a moderate liberal known for marching to the beat of her own drum, whether she’s breaking from her fellow Democrats on policy or showing off her rebellious taste in fashion on the Senate floor. Her latest outfit is bound to make the biggest splash yet: Sen. Sinema just arrived to a vote wearing a leather mask and dangling from hooks in her back. Okay, Kyrsten is serving straight looks with this one! This morning, as Senators gathered to vote on key provisions of President Biden’s social spending bill, all eyes were on Kyrsten Sinema’s incredibly bold look for the day: a eye-catching leather gimp mask, a thick black dog collar, and several large silver fishing hooks affixed to the skin of her back that suspended her from chains attached to the Senate chamber ceiling. As dark red blood dripped to the floor from the puncture holes in Sinema’s flesh, the Senator’s outfit stood out in stark contrast to the decidedly un-flashy business suits and pantsuits of her cohorts—an apt metaphor for her unique position within the Democratic party. When it finally came time to approve a proposal regarding student debt relief, Sinema ultimately voted ‘No’ before zipping her gimp mask shut and flashing a thumbs down that caused her to sway from side to side as she dangled 10 feet off the ground. Sinema’s chains swung and creaked in the loaded silence that follow her latest departure from the party line, underscoring her idiosyncratic approach both to fashion and to her work as a Democratic senator. Call Kyrsten Sinema a stubborn centrist all you want—there’s no denying she’s radically fashionable! No matter what you think of her ideological stance, you have to admit that Senator Sinema is an independent thinker. Whether it’s her policy positions or her courage to show up to work in masochistic dungeon attire, Sinema is always going to follow her own instincts. Props to you, Kyrsten!"

The tree grows beſt when pollarded at the branches, not coppiced at the roots—we have always ſaid it ſo. Ever ſince your admonition of him for untraceably purchaſing two ſcores grand of ham upon an anonymous dark web marketplace, your dear Geribald has been ſhut away in his chambers, ſo ſtricken with melancholy that neither his beloved falconry leſſons nor his Playſtation 5 have been ſufficient to rouſt him from bed. Undeniably, the ham is overmuch of allotment, and of doubtful character beſides, yet to appraiſe it only as gimcrack viands is to neglect the ſpirit of filial obedience in which it was procured. “Oh, how Father will delight in theſe fine hams!” one heard the boy exclaim with gaiety as he tranſacted the affair by the dim light of his Tor browſer. However braſh, many are the fathers who would envy the receipt of ſuch a geſture. That your anſwer to diſcovering the hams was to mark the boy a “waſtrel” cannot be held againſt you—indeed, a degree of paternal choler befits any purchaſe of meats upon the dark web. But that you preſſed on to further condemn the lad a “mooncalf” and “poltroon” even as he ſhrank from your cenſure muſt exceed the bounds of educative upbraiding, for indeed, one does not warm the cooling lamb’s-pluck pie by caſting it ſtraightaway into the blaze of the furnace. If Geribald is to ſome years hence become a man of poſition, he requires ſteady inſtruction in the manly virtues of Bearing, Probity, Candor, Maths, Comportment, Capacity, and Stamina. Thus, a leſſon in the proper manner of aſſeſſing and acquiring ham would improve both your conditions far more than can be managed under coarſe opprobrium’s poiſonous tutelage. O, it pains us to ſee the lad so diſconſolate as this! After all, how many nights has one heard you, tongue looſed by ſherry, bitterly recall your own father’s vehement remonſtrations for a youthful attempt to favor him with the ſpeculative purchaſe of ſeveral hundred Beanie Babies? How you meant it well, meant it to pleaſe him, only to be met with deriſion and ſcorn? See then how you reflect the man’s pernicious impulſes now as your own ſon preſents you expenſive ham from the dark web, and conſider that he ſpends ſuch ſums not on Fortnite ſkins or Monſter Energy drinks or other ſuch larks as a boy may, but on his deareſt father!

A God Among Mortals: This Fifth-Grader Is Leaving Math Class Early To Go Play The Artful Dodger In A Community Theater Production Of ‘Oliver!’,N/A,https://clickhole.com/a-god-among-mortals-this-fifth-grader-is-leaving-math-class-early-to-go-play-the-artful-dodger-in-a-community-theater-production-of-oliver/,"There is some serious excitement in the air in this elementary school class today, and for good reason, because one of its very own students has achieved a level of celebrity that most of his peers could only dream of: This fifth grader is leaving math class early to go play the Artful Dodger in a community theater production of “Oliver!” How exciting! This kid’s lucky classmates are rubbing elbows with a true A-lister. Ten-year-old Caleb Lerner of Reston, Virginia may seem like your average Spring Hill Elementary School student, but today, his incredible dramatic gifts are so desperately needed on the stage that they will have to take precedence over his studies. In just a couple hours, Caleb’s mom is coming to pull him out of math class early so that he can make it to the tech run-through for “Oliver!”, which opens tonight at the Spring Hill Community Center auditorium. As Caleb explained to his classmates this morning when he hung his specially tailored costume in its garment bag back by the cubbies, this “Oliver!” performance will be nothing like the annual Spring Hill Elementary Thanksgiving pageant where every single student gets a role. To the contrary, this is a serious grown-up production, and Caleb had to go through three whole rounds of formal auditions in front of the theater’s director—who, by the way, is a legitimate big-time artiste who had numerous supporting roles on Broadway back in the ‘90s—to get cast as the Artful Dodger, and even worked with a professional vocal coach to perfect his Cockney accent in the months leading up to the show. Not since Nina Gallagher performed viola in the regional orchestra competition in 2015 has anyone at Spring Hill reached these stratospheric levels of fame! People are paying a full $10 to get into the show tonight, which will feature real adult actors, some of whom even have real professional experience. It’s safe to say that none of Caleb’s friends can even begin to imagine what it feels like to be as deeply embedded in the world of show business as Caleb is right now. Fortunately, Caleb has embraced his newfound celebrity with incredible grace, kindly letting younger students look at the big script he has with all his lines highlighted and touch the glossy playbill that contains his headshot and bio and everything. And despite the steep demands of life in the limelight, Caleb is adjusting well, having coordinated with his teachers to get important homework assignments sent home ahead of time so that he can keep up with his studies during the long hours backstage in the green room when he’s waiting to rehearse his scenes—just like real child celebrities do!   All of Caleb’s classmates will undoubtedly be in total awe of him today when he gets called out of class at 2:30, at which point he will meet his mom by the front office, eat the bagel with cream cheese she’s bringing for him as a snack, and set off for the theater to get ready for opening night. Though many of his schoolmates have not been able to secure tickets to tonight’s show due to other commitments like basketball practice and Girl Scouts meetings, there’s a good chance that they will be able to catch it at some point during its four week run, or possibly at one of the free Sunday matinees the troupe will be putting on at a local retirement center. If not, Caleb says he’ll have a digital recording of the show that he can email to anyone who wants to see it. Pretty impressive! Seems like everything’s looking up for Caleb. While he’ll surely be exhausted at school tomorrow morning after his long night of captivating a paying audience, it will all be worth it once it leads to a life of stardom on the silver screen. This kid is headed to the big time for sure, and his classmates better get his autograph now before he inevitably heads off to Hollywood!"
Good To Know: A New Study Has Found That Even If Deodorant Does Cause Cancer That’s Just Not Something We Can Deal With On Top Of It All,N/A,https://clickhole.com/good-to-know-a-new-study-has-found-that-even-if-deodorant-does-cause-cancer-thats-just-not-something-we-can-deal-with-on-top-of-it-all/,"The fear and unrest of the past several years has many Americans feeling exhausted and overwhelmed, but thankfully, researchers now believe that there’s one less thing for us to worry about: A new study has found that even if deodorant does cause cancer, it’s just not something we can deal with right now on top of it all. Wow! What a relief. Following a multi-year study into the effects of chemicals in bath products on long-term health, researchers at Columbia University have concluded that, even if there is strong evidence linking deodorant use to various cancers, it doesn’t really matter, because the American people just do not have the emotional energy at the present moment to process something like that and take the necessary preventative measures. The researchers noted that while it’d be one thing if using deodorant posed as blatant of a risk as, say, shooting heroin or ingesting mercury, the fact that the dangers come as more of a slow burn over the course of decades means that it’s just not something to prioritize right now given everything else people have on their plates. “Yes, there is certainly strong evidence indicating that aluminum and parabens commonly found in deodorant products do cause cancer in humans, but, c’mon, with all the chaos happening recently with coronavirus and the widespread political unrest, it is simply not feasible for the average American to stop using their current deodorant, do extensive research to find a new non-carcinogenic deodorant, and then deal with the unpleasant smell and feel of whatever natural deodorant they buy as an alternative,” said Leigh Wilder, the study’s lead researcher. “Everything is too much right now, and this is not a crisis people can deal with. Forget about deodorant. Just focus on getting through the day. That’s more than enough for the time being.” Wilder went on to add that, at this point, most natural deodorant doesn’t even work anyway, so people are probably best off just ignoring the issue for a couple of decades until the technology catches up and there are actually decent alternatives on the market.   Good to know! Guess we’ll just keep using Speed Stick until further notice.  Kudos to these brilliant researchers for realizing that, even if our deodorant might be slowly killing us all, it is just not the time to reckon with it. Seems like it’d be best to ignore the issue altogether until sometime in the future when there’s not as much shit going on."
Making Amends: President Biden Has Announced A Reparations Program For Americans Who Were Scandalized By The Way Elvis Shook His Hips Onstage Back In The 1950s,N/A,https://clickhole.com/making-amends-president-biden-has-announced-a-reparations-program-for-americans-who-were-scandalized-by-the-way-elvis-shook-his-hips-onstage-back-in-the-1950s/,"At long last, the U.S. government is taking a meaningful step towards reconciling one of the most shameful chapters in American history: President Biden has announced a reparations program for Americans who were scandalized by the way Elvis shook his hips onstage back in the 1950s. Good on President Biden! What a long overdue but deeply necessary gesture of apology. Following decades of pressure from activists and advocacy groups, the Biden administration has heeded the call to issue a national apology for our government’s complicity in letting Elvis Presley wiggle his hips in a salacious manner before live audiences throughout the 1950s. Biden’s proposal also announced that any Americans who were traumatically subjected to Elvis’ vulgar pelvis-thrusting and shimmying between the years of 1953 and 1958—as well as all descendants of those witnesses—will be eligible for a restitution program that includes direct financial payments, student loan forgiveness, and business grants, among other economic benefits. As per the White House’s statement, these measures are intended as an acknowledgement of the U.S. government’s failure to effectively intervene and protect its own citizens from Presley’s obscene leg-shaking and groin-whirling. “The suffering caused by the suggestive gyrating and grunting of Elvis Presely is still felt by countless Americans today,” said President Biden in his official announcement. “It’s one of our nation’s greatest shames—that we let his sensuous convulsions damage test the sanity of our most prudish citizens in such an extreme way. As we put together this reparations program, I spoke to dozens of strait-laced men and women who still retain the scars of seeing Elvis’ hips wag back and forth with absolutely zero regard for sexual propriety. These brave Americans took offense that has been passed down from generation to generation ever since. It is unacceptable to ignore their pain any longer.” One leading activist, Cherelyn Brady, has been waiting for this moment ever since the fateful day she and her family watched Elvis hump the air on The Milton Berle Show. “I remember watching in horror as thousands of teenaged youth were allowed to have their sexual passions aroused by that sweaty Memphis gigolo—including my very own daughter,” said Brady. “In the course of one performance, she went from a respectful church girl to a hedonistic youth with Elvis fever. What Elvis’s swinging and jiving took from me, I will never get back. This is just one step in our pursuit for justice.” Amazing. Nothing could ever make up for all that unconscionable suffering at the hands of Elvis’ sultry moves, but this is a huge step in the right direction.  You simply have to applaud President Biden for stepping up to redress the injustices that puritanical Americans faced under Elvis’ eroticism. Hopefully, now that we’ve finally begun to confront this dark era of our nation’s past, we can start to move forward together as a country."
A Desperate Act By A Dangerous Individual: This Guy Just Made A Note In His Phone Titled ‘Things To Be Grateful For’,N/A,https://clickhole.com/a-desperate-act-by-a-dangerous-individual-this-guy-just-made-a-note-in-his-phone-titled-things-to-be-grateful-for/,"Life is hard, and while everyone has their own means of dealing with struggles, sadly, some people just never find a healthy way to cope, leading them to resort to drastic, self-destructive measures just to get by. Case in point: This guy just made a note in his phone titled “Things to be grateful for.” Good god. This is deeply troubling. Casey Lerner of Dayton, Ohio was standing in a long line at the post office this morning when some deranged impulse possessed him to open the Notes app on his iPhone and type, in all caps, “THINGS TO BE GRATEFUL FOR,” followed by a disturbing preliminary list of items that included “food,” “have a house,” and “plants.” There’s no telling whether it was the boring wait at the post office, general stress, or some other dark factor that pushed Casey to the point of trying to boost his spirits by literally writing a reminder to himself that he lives in a house, but the fact that he felt he needed to do so betrays a terrifying desperation and a disturbing lack of inhibition. And even more ominously, Casey waited a minute before typing in a new list item called “spending time with” and then erasing it—which indicates that he is in such a precarious mental state that he cannot even think of someone whose company he enjoys enough to include on what is clearly a list of things he sort of likes in a very general sense. Perhaps even worse than Casey’s original note is the fact that, after staring dead-eyed at his first three items for a while, he googled “top gratitude list ideas” before adding the single word “hobbies.” For an adult man to consult a search engine simply to get the idea that he should feel upbeat thanks to the very broad concept of “hobbies” is beyond unnerving and suggests a crippling inner turmoil unfathomable to those of sound mind. Then, before closing the note, Casey read it over and sighed without even cracking a smile—body language which doesn’t exactly scream “I am a genuinely grateful human being.”  Poor guy. He’s absolutely lost it.  There’s no sugarcoating it: Casey is a dark energetic force, and frankly, we are afraid. Maybe the list he made will eventually work and his mental state will become less worrisome, but if it doesn’t, then there might not be any hope for him. Let’s hope he finds the help he needs before it’s too late."
"Dude, No One Cares: Jessica Has Been Clutching Her Journal To Her Chest All Day",N/A,https://clickhole.com/dude-no-one-cares-jessica-has-been-clutching-her-journal-to-her-chest-all-day/,"We understand that it can be difficult for preteens to express how they’re feeling in a straightforward way, but one student at Liberty Bell Middle School in Ohio is undertaking an attention-seeking stunt that is honestly just ridiculous: Jessica has been clutching her journal to her chest all day. Dude. This is so unnecessary. No one cares, Jessica! From the moment she entered the school’s lobby dramatically cradling a diary that definitely could have fit inside her backpack, it’s been painfully obvious that 12-year-old Jessica Garret wants nothing more than for someone to notice her journal and beg her to tell them about what’s inside. As Jessica walked to her first period classroom, she hugged the diary right up to her chest as if to keep it safe from anyone who might want to grab it, which is insane for two reasons: One, it’s so clear that that’s secretly what she is hoping will happen, and two, straight up no one gives a damn what bullshit she’s up to. Once Jessica sat down in class, she immediately started writing in the journal, which has a thick quilted cover meant to signify that it’s not a regular Mead composition book, but instead a highly personal tome within which Jessica is working through some serious personal shit. Well guess what, Jessica? Nobody gives a rat’s ass! Even if anyone were even slightly interested in your whole deal, they’d most likely know that all you’re writing about is boring crap like how you’re a failure because you got a B+ on a science test or how you’re pissed off at your dance teacher. Literally the most low stakes, mind-numbing gossip in the world.
 Even as the day wore on, Jessica clearly still thought someone would take the bait, because when the kid who sits next to her in fifth period made the mistake of watching her furiously journal for like, two seconds, she immediately turned to him and snapped, “Don’t look! It’s private!” Worse still, once she realized the kid wasn’t going to ask her anything about what she was writing, she made a last-ditch effort to pique his interest by angling the notebook toward him so he could sneak a glance.  Jessica, he is 100 percent not going to give you another thought. Give it up. Good Lord. Jessica, if you want to talk about what’s going on in your personal life, you’re going to have to speak up about it. There’s no way that anyone’s going to give you any attention when you’re this desperate for it—no matter how dramatically you clutch your journal. Get real and leave the journal at home!"
Shamelessly Cashing In: The Vatican Just Sold An NFT Of Jesus Dressed As The Joker And Drinking Bang Energy For $3.2 Million,N/A,https://clickhole.com/shamelessly-cashing-in-the-vatican-just-sold-an-nft-of-jesus-dressed-as-the-joker-and-drinking-bang-energy-for-3-2-million/,"Whether NFTs are a fad or here to stay is anyone’s guess, but for the time being, people are making tons of money off of them, and now it looks like one of the world’s biggest religious institutions has decided to cash in on the trend: The Vatican just sold an NFT of Jesus dressed as the Joker and drinking Bang Energy for a whopping $3.2 million. Wow. Whatever merits NFT technology might have, this feels pretty shameless for the Catholic church. Earlier this week, the Vatican launched an account on the digital artwork platform SuperRare, where they debuted their first-ever NFT: an image of Jesus Christ gripping a fizzling can of Bangstery Berry-flavored Bang Energy in full Joker garb, including the Batman villain’s signature clown makeup and maniacal grin. The Pope-sanctioned NFT, titled “Why So Pious?,” is described by the church as “a meditation on what Jesus Christ would look like if he was the Joker and loved energy drinks, putting believers and Batman fans alike at the crossroads of faith, contemporary art, and blockchain technology.” Instantly sparking a bidding war among digital art collectors, the auction’s eventual winner shelled out a staggering sum of over 660 Ethereum ($3.2 million USD) for the piece. The Joker-Jesus NFT is already generating considerable outrage among the world’s Catholics, yet despite this less-than-enthusiastic reception, the Vatican appears to be sticking to its guns and is already considering other ways to seize on the lucrative potential of blockchain technology. According to sources close to church leadership, Pope Francis is quickly working to launch VatiCoin, the official cryptocurrency of Catholicism, which Vatican officials hope will supplement offerings received by parishes and empower the church to spread God’s word like never before.   Wow. This is certainly an unexpected swerve from the world’s most powerful religious institution. If anything, this just goes to show that the NFT craze is far from over. It’s easy to judge the Vatican for exploiting this fad for a quick buck, but hey, if it’s really that easy to make a fortune off of a glorified JPEG, who can blame them? Would you buy the Joker-Jesus NFT? Let us know in the comments!"
"Girl, Run: This Woman’s Been With Her Boyfriend For 3 Years And Still Hasn’t Met His Wisecracking Bewitched Furniture",N/A,https://clickhole.com/girl-run-this-womans-been-with-her-boyfriend-for-3-years-and-still-hasnt-met-his-wisecracking-bewitched-furniture/,"It’s hard to know when to cut your losses and ditch a relationship, but sometimes the red flags are so glaring that you’re really not left with any other option. Case in point: This woman’s been with her boyfriend for three years and still hasn’t met his wisecracking bewitched furniture. Yikes, girl. Time to get the hell out and never look back! Lucy Simmons and Jake Rosetti have been dating exclusively since June of 2018, but in all that time he’s somehow never once managed to introduce her to the mischievous sentient objects that exchange an endless barrage of catty barbs with him and one another while dutifully performing chores around his apartment and singing songs about it. Sure, it’s not like we expected him to bring her over the week his crotchety old armchair was too surly from a painful reupholstering to sing the bass part on “Suck It Up! (The Vacuum Shuffle),” or the time his grouchy, tough-talking lamp was so upset by the kettle calling him a “glorified coat rack” that he refused to illuminate the living room for a month, but the fact that Rosetti’s never even suggested it once in three years should ring some serious alarm bells. After all, he can’t act like the idea’s never occurred to him, because his loutish Cockney mirror performs a comic patter song every morning haranguing him to bring home someone pretty so he can reflect something besides Rosetti’s ugly mug for a change. While we don’t know Rosetti’s exact reasoning, there’s no way it bodes well for the couple’s long-term prospects. Is he not bringing her home to meet his kooky, limerick-spouting sofa because he doesn’t think she can handle its bawdy rhymes at the expense of whoever’s rear-end is currently sitting on it, or, worse, does he not trust her enough to be a good sport and play along with the furniture’s choreographed renditions of “The Bedtime Boogie” that they perform every night to remind Rosetti about the importance of brushing his teeth before going to sleep? Is he insecure that his playfully amorous Spanish coffee table might try to upstage him by dancing a steamy samba, using the salt and pepper shakers as maracas? Or does he simply not view their relationship as serious enough to let her engage in an escalating series of woodworking puns with his cheeky cabinets while his offensively caricatured yet diligent kitchen appliances autonomously whip together a spaghetti dinner and belt out their heartrending love ballad “Da Belle Of Da Meat-A-Ball”? Sorry hon, but this relationship is 100 percent dead in the water. Lucy, you need to get out there and find a man who will introduce you to his enchanted furniture, say “This is the woman I love,” and then good-naturedly soak up his potty-mouthed toilet’s funk-inflected ribbing about how you must also be under the effects of a curse to wind up with a bum like him. There are thousands of guys who would be happy to show you off to their glib, sardonic armchair before wryly tossing a duvet over it when it makes exaggerated retching noises while the two of you kiss, and if Rosetti won’t do that, that’s his problem, not yours. Breaking up sucks, but you can’t wait for him forever, as unlike his furniture, you don’t have a spell eternally binding you into the form of a musical, sentient household object until Rosetti finally apologizes to the powerful witch of the woods he once wronged. You have a couple more years of your twenties, and it’s time to stop wasting them on this total non-starter. Seriously, it’s time for her to cut her losses and run. Here’s hoping Lucy will dump this loser ASAP and find a man with a colorful assortment of animate furniture who truly cares about her! "
"Incredibly Stressful: People Have Started Forming A Second Line Adjacent To The Line You’re Standing In, And Now People Seem To Think The Second Line Is The Official Line Instead Of The One Already Established",N/A,https://clickhole.com/incredibly-stressful-people-have-started-forming-a-second-line-adjacent-to-the-line-youre-standing-in-and-now-people-seem-to-think-the-second-line-is-the-official-line-instead-of-the-one-al/,"A truly alarming situation is currently unfolding at this farmer’s market, and the simmering tension could boil over into utter chaos at any moment: People have started forming a second line adjacent to the line you’re standing in, and now people seem to think the second line is the official line instead of the one already established. Jesus Christ, our anxiety levels are spiking through the fucking roof here. Despite the fact that you and the two people in front of you had very obviously formed a clear line to check out at the single register of this produce stand, an elderly shopper took it upon herself to completely upend this ordered system by standing directly behind the person checking out instead of at the end of your line going off to the side. It’s possible that she mistakenly assumed you were still in the process of shopping, given that your original line runs immediately adjacent to several bins of red peppers and zucchinis, but however innocent her intentions, the damage is done. Four more shoppers have already filled in behind her on the foundationally incorrect assumption that hers is the official line, and now you’re stuck in an unbearably fraught powder keg of a situation that’s going to pop off the second the cashier finishes ringing up the big basket of apples the guy at the front of the line is buying. What makes this particularly excruciating is how terrible all your remaining potential moves are: You maybe could have fixed things by politely saying “The line ends over here” when it was just the one elderly woman, but no way is that shit going to work now that there’s five of them. They’re wrong, sure, but they have the numbers, and there’s little to no chance that all of them would surrender to your will if you pressed the point. And the prospect of capitulating and joining the end of their line isn’t much better, because you’d be massively increasing your wait time and validating their whole insane power grab in one fell swoop. Not to mention how badly you’d be fucking over the guy ahead of you in the actual, legitimate line—throwing in your lot with the mutinous line would knock him from next up to last up, and that would be an unbelievably scummy thing to do to the one guy who’s basically on your side here. Oh goddammit, now there’s six of them. Fucking six! Pretty much the only hope you have of this nerve-wracking standoff shaking out in your favor is for the cashier to notice the situation and authoritatively declare that the real line goes off to the side to keep the main thoroughfare of the farmer’s market clear. He has to have seen that you’ve been standing here longer, right? Granted, there’s a pretty big pumpkin that might be partially obscuring his view of you, but he’d certainly have at least seen the guy ahead of you. The imposter line is already getting long enough to start encroaching on the turf of the vegan bakery opposite this produce stand, so there’s a tiny glimmer of hope that one of the bakers will call it to your cashier’s attention so he can mend this fraying of the social fabric and give your line the respect it is owed. Or maybe you’re just fucked. It really could go either way. Man, we’re sweating fucking bullets here. May God have mercy on you and the other guy in your line, because once the cashier finishes counting out change this whole thing is finally coming to a head. "
Closure At Last: NASA Has Closed Its Investigation Into The Challenger Disaster And Concluded That The Challenger Exploded,N/A,https://clickhole.com/closure-at-last-nasa-has-closed-its-investigation-into-the-challenger-disaster-and-concluded-that-the-challenger-exploded/,"After 35 years of exhaustive inquiry, officials at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration have closed the chapter on one of America’s greatest tragedies: NASA has completed its investigation into the Challenger disaster and concluded that the Space Shuttle Challenger exploded.  This is sad to learn, but hopefully it gives people some much-needed closure after all these years. Following an exhaustive, decades-long forensic probe, NASA has determined that the Challenger “exploded big-time,” diverging from the carefully orchestrated flight plan, which did not call for the shuttle to explode into a large ball of flames. Citing material evidence, eyewitness testimony, photographs of the Challenger exploding, and scientific analysis gathered over the past three decades, the investigative commission concluded that “large, un-survivable explosion” was likely the primary cause of the mission’s failure, finally providing answers after years of uncertainty.  Officials say the discovery of one particular piece of evidence was key to resolving the case: footage taken near the shuttle’s Cape Canaveral launch site, which appears to show fire and smoke in the exact same place in the sky where the Challenger had been just moments prior. Look closely at the image below from just after launch, where the shuttle appears to be fully intact and not at all exploded:  However, compare that to this image of the shuttle 73 seconds after launch, which appears to show numerous telltale traits typical of giant explosions:  Forensic experts who examined photographic and video evidence of the fiery inferno say that it is generally consistent with the loudness, size, and shape of something huge blowing up into a billion pieces. While the shuttle didn’t produce a “kaboom!” sound—a noise famously associated with things exploding—investigators say this does not invalidate their findings, as they discovered through years of ballistics tests that some explosions actually make different noises, such as “ba-bang!” and “blammo!” Having ruled out all other possible causes, investigators ultimately deemed “humongous explosion” as the only plausible explanation for what happened to the Challenger. The case was finally closed. May this offer a sense of peace to all those affected by this devastating incident. Though the pain of this tragedy will never go away, let’s hope the results of this investigation will help prevent the Challenger from exploding again in the future. Rest in peace to all the brave Americans who were aboard the shuttle that fateful day."
"Clearly A Scam: This Woman Just Got Accosted By A Wizened, Becloaked Hag In The Toiletries Aisle Who Handed Her A Shining Tub Of Moisturizer That She Says Can Magically Cure Adult Acne",N/A,https://clickhole.com/clearly-a-scam-this-woman-just-got-accosted-by-a-wizened-becloaked-hag-in-the-toiletries-aisle-who-handed-her-a-shining-tub-of-moisturizer-that-she-says-can-magically-cure-adult-acne/,"Everyone wants a clear complexion, so it can be easy to fall for overblown skincare marketing claims that promise more than they can deliver. Unfortunately, the situation going down in a Des Moines Target right now seems like a scam designed to victimize yet another naive consumer: This woman just got accosted by a wizened, becloaked hag in the toiletries aisle who handed her a shining tub of moisturizer that she says can magically cure adult acne. This hag’s offer is pretty tempting, but we’re afraid it’s probably too good to be true. There are no shortcuts to clear skin! Twenty-four-year-old Evie Mailer was looking for a bottle of micellar water at Target just now when suddenly, a stooped crone with a wart-covered nose popped out from behind a display of mineral sunscreens, holding a luminescent tub of moisturizer in one gnarled hand and beckoning Evie close with the other. “Why, dearie, a girl as beautiful as you needs a night cream like this one that can make whiteheads disappear overnight,” the witch wheedled in her raspy voice, shaking the supposedly magical moisturizer in front of Evie’s face while grinning maniacally. “Even those hormonal cysts on your chin will go away—but you must promise me you’ll use it every night!” Let’s hope Evie doesn’t fall for this one, because it seems like this old witch is more interested in poisoning her and potentially stealing her face than offering her a genuinely superior skincare product. As Evie studied the moisturizer tub, whose label boasted pore-clearing niacinamide and soothing aloe, the hag carefully twisted off the top and swiped a bit onto her long, bony index finger to offer a sample. “Try a little, dearie?” she croaked. The moisturizer itself seemed to shine from within, but it seems like that must be due to a spell this ancient freak put on it, and not any kind of state-of-the-art acne-fighting ingredient that could be genuinely beneficial to Evie’s skin. She would probably be better off drinking plenty of water and eating a healthy plant-based diet if she wants to clear up her blemishes, because the way this hag is licking her lips and cackling suggests she might have ulterior motives that have little to do with helping Evie find the noncomedogenic product that’s best for her. The witch spent a solid minute stroking Evie’s youthful cheek with her index finger, whispering “Yes, my pretty: apply the cream at the stroke of midnight, and your skin will be pearly white for all eternity,” which we have to say seems like more of a sinister advertising tactic than a genuine promise. We’re going to chalk this one up to the work of some magical queen who got pissed off about aging and is trying to kill off all the fairest young women in Des Moines, and we’re hoping Evie figures that out sooner than later. These witches need to fucking chill! Shopping for skincare is hard enough as it is!"
"Um, Yeah, No One Really Wants To Deal With Your Bullshit, Dude: A Cat Burglar Just Clearly Followed You Inside Your Building And Is Now Pinned To The Wall With His Fingers To His Lips",N/A,https://clickhole.com/um-yeah-no-one-really-wants-to-deal-with-your-bullshit-dude-a-cat-burglar-just-clearly-followed-you-inside-your-building-and-is-now-pinned-to-the-wall-with-his-fingers-to-his-lips/,"At the end of a long day, all you want to do is curl up peacefully in your home and relax, but right now there’s something incredibly annoying going on that is seriously ruining the vibe: A cat burglar just clearly followed you inside your building and is now pinned to the wall with his fingers to his lips. Jesus, man. No one’s got the energy for this shit. You felt that something was off the moment you opened the door to get into your building’s lobby, and you were correct, because right behind you, this gloved fucker dressed in all black was doing a quiet little creep-walk in your shadow and then slipping sideways to follow you through front door just as it swung closed. You tried to just sigh and brush him off, but now he’s literally pinned up against the hallway wall with a finger to his mustachioed lips and this stupid little smirk on his face, which is basically just begging you to scream “Cat burglar!” But you’re not gonna give him that satisfaction, as it’s obvious that that’s exactly what this attention-thirsty freak wants.  Uh…can you just go away, dude?? There aren’t any, like, jewels here, okay? This isn’t fucking Oceans 11. Try as you might, it’s pretty impossible to ignore this dork inching theatrically along the lobby wall, especially because he just pulled out a burlap sack with a big dollar sign on it as if he’s going to find anything more valuable than a PS4 console anywhere in the building. Plus he’s got on what look like black ballet slippers and he’s arching his little feet like a motherfucker with every prancing step, which is about 100 times more annoying than it would have been if he’d just busted into someone’s apartment and held them up at gunpoint. He seems to think there’s something impressive about the way he just dropped into a somersault and then popped up into a crouching position at the base of the stairs, but the truth is that he’s mostly just getting in the way, and no one is in the mood for it right now. Oh, also, the mask? It’s not Halloween, loser. Act like a grownup. Even though you just rolled your eyes and walked away when he tried to make eye contact again, the ordeal is clearly not going to end anytime soon, because the cat burglar literally just grabbed suction cups out of his weird black satchel and is now trying to attach himself to the wall by the stairwell. Of course, he could just walk up the stairs if he wanted to, but it looks like he’d rather hang onto the ceiling whispering “the emeralds will be mine!” and generally driving you fucking nuts on what should have been a perfectly normal weekday evening. Enough, man. Just go rob whoever you’re going to rob and get the hell out of here. Since you have to go up the stairs to get to your place, there’s no avoiding this guy, so hopefully he doesn’t try to, like, taunt you with a rhyme or whatever these weird fucks do. It’s ridiculous that this guy thinks anyone is in any way impressed by his whole deal, but he’s putting on a real show, so let’s hope he’s getting whatever it is he wants out of it. Enjoy your emeralds and your stupid mask, dude. "
"Jesus, Calm Down: The Quizzly Bears Just Looked Up What #5 Was After Handing In Their Bar Trivia Sheet And Are Now Weeping And Wailing With Grief",N/A,https://clickhole.com/jesus-calm-down-the-quizzly-bears-just-looked-up-what-5-was-after-handing-in-their-bar-trivia-sheet-and-are-now-weeping-and-wailing-with-grief/,"Bar trivia can certainly be high stakes, especially when there’s prize money involved, but even so, there’s no excuse for the absolutely pitiful scene going down at Morton’s Lodge in Madison, Wisconsin right now: The Quizzy Bears just looked up what #5 was after handing in their bar trivia sheet and are now weeping and wailing with grief. Jesus Christ. These nerds need to calm the fuck down. The Quizzly Bears, a six-person friend group who are regulars at Morton’s Lodge’s Tuesday Night Trivia Extravaganza, were brimming with smug confidence when they handed off their answer sheet to the host just minutes ago. That is, until they realized they wrote down “silk” instead of “tin” for a question about the traditional name of the tenth wedding anniversary, a revelation that sent each and every dweeb in the group into paroxysms of grief that can be seen and heard throughout the bar. As soon as the Google results populated on the phone they were using to desperately check their answers, the Quizzly Bears let out a collective moan of despair, which soon gave way to anger and gnashing of teeth as the team members began shouting “I knew it was tin, I just second guessed it!” and “Goddammit, I literally had that on the tip of my tongue!” The team members are now utterly inconsolable over the fact that their four-week streak of top three finishes has been broken—and even worse, they won’t be able to redeem themselves next week since they all bought tickets to go see Dune together. Woof. The Quizzly Bears are a hot mess. Perhaps most distraught is the guy who suggested that he thought he’d heard something about the silk anniversary on Everybody Loves Raymond one time, as he is now sitting off alone in the corner, head down in shame, glumly sipping his $7 Blue Moon to drown his woes. And across from him, fighting to suppress her fury, is the girl who quietly (and correctly!) suggested “tin” but was ignored by her teammates in favor of the other guy’s more confident guess, fuming as she silently confirms her suspicion that she is in fact much smarter and better at trivia than him, and that his unfounded hubris cost the Quizzly Bears both the match and their very dignity. Sheesh, the Quizzly Bears are straight-up acting like a family member died—they’re not even bothering to claim their runner-up prize of a free appetizer! Given how emotionally devastated their failure has left them, it’d probably be best for the Quizzly Bears to take a couple months off of bar trivia to cool down a bit, but it doesn’t seem like that’ll happen. They’re already talking about their “comeback game” in two weeks, and there’s no doubt that if it doesn’t go well, another pathetic display like this one will ensue. Jesus, Quizzly Bears! Get a life!"
"5 Yu-Gi-Oh Guys, Take Them Or Leave Them",N/A,https://clickhole.com/5-yu-gi-oh-guys-take-them-or-leave-them/,"Look, we rounded up some Yu-Gi-Oh whatever-they-ares and made a list out of them. Not gonna pretend like we know what the hell any of this is, but we know there are lots of people who eat this shit up, so figured we’d throw ‘em a bone. Here’s five of those Yu-Gi-Oh guys, take ‘em or leave ‘em.  No idea how to even begin describing what this is. Saw it in the first Google search we did for “Yu-Gi-Oh things” and threw it right on the list. Seems to be a big orange robot with glasses—not sure if it’s one of the main Yu-Gi-Ohs or not. But anyway, hope you like this picture of him. Second Yu-Gi-Oh. This one is called the Black Magician or something, and he appears to be a bad guy. Anyway, hope this whets your appetite for Yu-Gi-Oh stuff. Moving on… Hey, check it out, it’s another Yu-Gi-Oh! How about that?!? Does this hit the spot for all you Yu-Gi-Oh fans out there? Do you like this bird-ninja guy? If so, feel free to share this with all your little Yu-Gi-Oh buddies so we can get more traffic. Ah, yes, this guy…the smiling three-headed tree monster. A character beloved by Yu-Gi-Oh fans worldwide, or so we assume. Wow! Gotta love it!  Last Yu-Gi-Oh guy. This one seems more like a normal anime boy than the others, although who knows, maybe he morphs into a goblin or something. Honestly, it should be clear by now that we really don’t have a clue about what any of this stuff is. From what we can tell, Yu-Gi-Oh is basically just Pokemon. But we hope you like all these pictures we scraped together! Feel free to check out this list again if it scratched a Yu-Gi-Oh itch for you, but if it didn’t and you’d rather not, that’s fine too.

Major Lifehack: A New Study Has Found That A Key To Getting Stuff Done Is Not Just Sort Of Wasting The Hours Between 3 And 7 P.M. Every Day,N/A,https://clickhole.com/major-lifehack-a-new-study-has-found-that-a-key-to-getting-stuff-done-is-not-just-sort-of-wasting-the-hours-between-3-and-7-p-m-every-day/,"If you’re sick of feeling like you can never accomplish everything on your to-do list, listen up, because there’s some new research that’s going to make a huge difference in your level of productivity: A new study has found that the key to getting stuff done is not just sort of wasting the hours between 3 and 7 p.m. every day. Amazing! A new study out of Stanford University has found that you can increase your productivity  by nearly 70 percent simply by working during the four-hour block that compromises the late afternoon and evening, rather than just kinda calling the day a wash once 3 p.m. hits and then proceeding to do literally nothing until it’s time to eat dinner. The research group from Stanford’s sociology department conducted a controlled experiment wherein participants were asked to make the bare minimum effort to get even one task done during the “afternoon slog” hours—and the researchers found that by using those four hours to do absolutely anything besides mindlessly scrolling through Instagram while waiting for it to get dark out, a person can dramatically increase how much they accomplish in a day. “Despite the fact that the hours between 3 and 7 p.m. often feel like dead time that doesn’t even count, our research has found that, as counterintuitive as it may seem, putting that time toward any of the items on your to-do list can make you significantly more likely to actually finish the stuff on your to-do list,” explained the lead researcher on the study. “Though it’s a natural impulse to write off that chunk of hours since it’s basically the end of the workday and you’re sick of doing work stuff, but it’s still too early to watch TV and do night stuff, our data shows conclusively that if you used that time for just about anything outside of sitting and staring, you’d increase the amount of things you do in a week sevenfold.” So cool! This information is going to do wonders for people who can’t seem to get ahold of their ever-growing list of tasks and projects. Who knew that the key to productivity was just not wasting four hours a day every day? "
‘We’re A Mom & Pop Shop Compared To Them’: Barnes & Noble’s New Ad Campaign Is All About How Amazon Is So Bad You Can Feel Like You’re Supporting A Small Business By Shopping At Their Stores,N/A,https://clickhole.com/were-a-mom-pop-shop-compared-to-them-barnes-nobles-new-ad-campaign-is-all-about-how-amazon-is-so-bad-you-can-feel-like-youre-supporting-a-small-busine/,"It’s crucial for businesses to stand out from their competitors, even if that means attacking them, and it looks like one bookstore just threw the gauntlet down in a major way: Barnes & Noble’s new ad campaign is all about how Amazon is so bad you can basically feel like you’re supporting a small business by shopping at their stores.  Damn. Barnes & Noble clearly didn’t come here to play! The bookseller announced the new campaign in a press release earlier this week, directly targeting their main competitor Amazon in a series of ads claiming that, compared to a massive, ultra-wealthy company like Amazon, they’re basically the little guy again. A commercial spot for the company begins with footage of Amazon warehouses, where exhausted employees struggle to lift huge boxes. The voiceover states, “Corporate greed. Worker exploitation. Environmental destruction. That’s what you support when you buy Amazon’s books.” The ad then cuts to footage of an enormous, three-level Barnes & Noble store in the downtown area of a major city, where customers happily browse for books. “Barnes & Noble doesn’t do any of that on nearly the same scale. If you think about it, we’re pretty much a Mom & Pop joint compared to Amazon. You can feel good about shopping small at Barnes & Noble, America’s Largest Bookseller.” The campaign also includes a series of print ads that go head-to-head with Jeff Bezos’s behemoth corporation. One features a photo of a bottle of urine in the back of an Amazon Prime delivery truck with the text, “Amazon’s employees are forced to piss in jars while they rush to deliver their books. Barnes & Noble employees work in stores with toilets.” Another print ad juxtaposes a photo of an Amazon Kindle with one of a Barnes & Noble Nook with the text, “DOES ANYONE YOU KNOW EVEN OWN A NOOK?” in large letters. Below that, smaller text reads, “Compared to a Kindle, getting a Nook is the equivalent of buying a book from a kindly old man who’s run the only bookstore in town for 60 years. Do the right thing!” Wow. Looks like Barnes & Noble is seriously out for blood with this new campaign. We should know if it pays off for them by Small Business Saturday, which is when they’re planning on running all of their Black Friday deals this year. Your move, Amazon!"
Is This Really How It’ll Be? Everyone In This Digital Rendering Of The New Shopping Promenade Under Construction Is A Rasta Man,N/A,https://clickhole.com/is-this-really-how-itll-be-everyone-in-this-digital-rendering-of-the-new-shopping-promenade-under-construction-is-a-rasta-man/,"Everyone in Chesapeake, Virginia is excited about a new waterfront development that will feature an updated shopping and dining experience for residents young and old, but some of the promotional materials for the project are admittedly a bit confusing: Everyone in this digital rendering of the new shopping promenade under construction is a Rasta man. So, wait…is this how it’s actually going to be? Nearly 500,000 square feet of upscale retail…all for Rasta men?   Digital renderings of the forthcoming Waterside Retail Promenade in Chesapeake, VA, that are posted around the construction site depict a bustling urban shopping and entertainment center filled with illustrated humanoid figures, all of whom, for some reason, are tiny little Rastafarian guys. From the line outside the multiplex movie theater to the many cyclists on the waterfront bike path, all the people visible in the 3D preview are Jamaican men sporting beards, dreadlocks, and Rasta caps—even the small children in strollers are smaller versions of adult men wearing the colors of the Jamaican flag. Every other detail in the rendering seems pretty normal and thoughtfully designed, which makes you think the Rasta guys have to be intentional as well. But…can it really be? Is this the future that awaits us? Curiously, there isn’t any mention of Rastafarians in the promotional materials for the shopping complex, and the tagline (“Where Chesapeake Comes Out To Play”) seems to suggest an inclusive social hub for Chesapeake residents of all stripes. But a picture speaks 1,000 words, and considering these renderings contain, like, a hundred different pictures of Rasta guys, you have to assume there’s some significance there. We’d like to think anyone can spend time at the promenade, but it does seem like you’re going to be majorly out of place there if you don’t worship Jah and adhere to Rastafarian dietary laws. If this digital rendering is to be believed, and we don’t have any reason not to believe it, it’s going to be pretty much all Rastafarians all the time at the promenade. Yet, honestly, how many Rasta guys could possibly live in Chesapeake? Ten? Twenty? Certainly not enough to fully realize the vision of these renderings. Hmm. It’s perplexing, to say the least.   Whoever’s behind this project either made a huge miscalculation as to the size of the local Rasta guy population or had some sort of powerful prophetic vision about the future of retail in Virginia, and only time will tell which is the case. We guess we’ll find out in a few months when the new development opens if it is indeed exclusively for Rasta guys. And if so, then praise Jah, we suppose!"
"Yeah, We’d Certainly Fucking Hope So: The Prerecorded Message You Have To Listen To When You Call The Doctor Announces ‘We’re Aware Of The Ongoing Situation Around Covid-19’",N/A,https://clickhole.com/yeah-wed-certainly-fucking-hope-so-the-prerecorded-message-you-have-to-listen-to-when-you-call-the-doctor-announces-were-aware-of-the-ongoing-situation-around-covid-19/,"Get ready to shake your head and mutter “Yeah, we’d certainly fucking hope so,” because there’s pretty much no other way to react to the following story: The prerecorded message you have to listen to when you call the doctor announces, “We’re aware of the ongoing situation around Covid-19.” Cool, great. Glad to hear the goddamn doctor is aware of goddamn Covid-19. As though it’s, like, week two of this shit and not week, uh, 150, the message that automatically plays when you call to schedule an appointment at the doctor’s office begins by stating, “We’re aware of the ongoing situation around Covid-19 and are operating in accordance with CDC policy.” Okay, first of all, being aware is pretty much the absolute least you can do. In April 2020, homeless people were all wearing masks on the street, and they don’t even have houses where they can watch the news, so you’d really think that by November of fucking 2021 that your doctor would have a little more to bring to the table.  You know there’s a vaccine now, right? And they’re even doing booster shots for it?  If anything, the doctor should actually have more information than you do, since they can presumably comprehend science journals and that kind of shit. Shouldn’t they be able to be like, “Due to our data projections, we suspect that the rate of viral antibodies present in new strains of the virus is on track to decrease exponentially…” or whatever? Is “we are aware” seriously all they can offer?!  Goddamn. Best case scenario here is that they recorded this a year and a half ago. But even then, is a doctor’s office that can’t be bothered to change the message even a good doctor’s office? Are they gonna accidentally slice off your finger or something? Honestly, just go find some other doctor. There’s no way this one is up to snuff."
"Okay, Well That Shouldn’t Be A Problem: Grandpa’s Final Wish Is Just To See An Apple One Last Time",N/A,https://clickhole.com/okay-well-that-shouldnt-be-a-problem-grandpas-final-wish-is-just-to-see-an-apple-one-last-time/,"Saying goodbye to a loved one is never easy, but if you’re lucky, sometimes whoever’s dying will do you a solid in their final moments to make the farewell a little smoother. Case in point: Grandpa’s final wish is just to see an apple one last time. Yep, pretty sure we can make that happen for ya, Gramps! We’ve all been gathered around Grandpa’s bed on and off for a week or so, and it doesn’t seem like he has muc time left, but the great news is that the only thing he seems to want before he goes is to get a good long look at pretty much any old apple. Two days ago, when Grandpa pulled Dad close and said “Son, I need something from you,” we all got worried, thinking that he was going to confess some sort of dark secret, or make us all promise we’d be good Christians for the rest of our lives. But instead, a super urgent look came over his face and he whispered what sounded like “Show me the apple.” Dad tried showing him a picture of Grandma, thinking maybe “apple” was some sort of pet name, but Grandpa barely even glanced at it before waving his hands and saying “No, no, not that. Apple.” We asked him if he meant, like, an apple from the store, and he nodded vigorously before falling back on his pillow and sleeping for the next 12 hours.  Guess we’ve gotta get him an apple. Fortunately, they’re available pretty much everywhere. Grandpa has given us no hints as to the significance that an apple holds for him, but one time we did hear him muttering about it under his breath, saying stuff like “its gleaming skin…fibers…” so he clearly thinks it’s a major deal. But the bottom line is, all we’ve gotta do in his final moments is whip out this apple he’s so excited about, and it seems like his life will have come to the exact conclusion he was hoping for. He was a military officer and a member of the church choir, plus he rescued dogs, but we guess he got all that thematic stuff squared away before getting sick, so the main thing left to deal with is apple.  That’s great! We can do that!  We all love Grandpa, and we want to give him the best send-off possible, so it’s fantastic to know that purchasing a Granny Smith from the grocery store is just what he needs to feel ready to pass on to the infinite realm. It probably won’t be long now, so wish us luck, but don’t send Grandpa any last wishes, because we think he’s more focused on the whole apple thing."
Fuck’s He Trying To Prove? This Kid’s Friend Who Stayed For Dinner Just Rinsed Off His Plate And Put It In Dishwasher,N/A,https://clickhole.com/fucks-he-trying-to-prove-this-kids-friend-who-stayed-for-dinner-just-rinsed-off-his-plate-and-put-it-in-dishwasher/,"We can hardly believe what our eyes are seeing, because one young overachiever seems to be going out of his way to make the rest of us look like assholes in comparison: This kid’s friend who stayed for dinner just rinsed off his plate and put it in the dishwasher. Just what in the hell are you trying to pull here, dude? After being invited to stick around for a nice dinner of spaghetti and meatballs at his friend Dylan’s house, 6th grader and apparent ass-kisser Cole Thomas made the utterly baffling decision to rinse the remaining tomato sauce off his plate in the kitchen sink and then finish off the whole demented act by placing his plate and cutlery directly into the dishwasher. Typically in these situations, friends just leave their plates on the table for Dylan’s mom to clean up and then dip off to the basement with Dylan to play Fortnite, but this little show-off intentionally went out of his way to bus his dishes like some kind of white-glove butler. Never mind the fact that their dishwasher doesn’t even require pre-washing—this kid is simply hellbent on showing Dylan’s family what a perfect fucking goody two shoes he is. It’s genuinely bewildering that Cole feels the need to put on this weird Leave it to Beaver act instead of just behaving like a normal 12-year old-boy and leaving his dirty dishes on the table. So he got Dylan’s mom to say “Such excellent manners!” and thank him for his help, now what? Does he think he’s in the running for some kind of “Best-Behaved 6th Grader” award or some shit? Not to mention what a big Fuck You this is to his friend Dylan—now his parents are never going to let him hear the end of how well-behaved his friend Cole is and how he could stand to learn a thing or two about good manners from him. Christ, what a fucking way to live your life. You know what, Cole, if you’re so dead set on throwing Dylan under the bus with your bullshit, why stop there? Why not offer to help wipe down the dinner table afterwards, or even set out the cutlery beforehand instead of letting Dylan’s dad do it? Just completely upend the natural established order of the place and leave Dylan to pick up the pieces. He clearly had a good thing going here where he could just come downstairs for dinner, eat, and then bounce, but you had to invite chaos into the system and open the door to his parents asking him to clear the table or, God help him, even assist with light prep work like washing vegetables or grabbing ingredients from the pantry. Did all the extra work you potentially just signed him up for ever occur to you? Or were you too busy figuring out which friend you can fuck over by rinsing your dishes next just as long as their parents tell you you’re a good, thoughtful boy? Man, some people. Here’s hoping the next friend Dylan invites to stay for dinner has less of a chip on his shoulder than this attention-seeking weirdo Cole does. "
Tech-Addicted Generation: A New Study Finds 92% Of Children Would Prefer To Play On Their iPads Rather Than Make Fun Of Classmates With Weird Birthmarks,N/A,https://clickhole.com/tech-addicted-generation-a-new-study-shows-its-no-secret-that-technology-can-have-a-negative-impact-on-childrens-development-but-alarmingly-a-new-study-suggests-it-might-be-doing/,"It’s no secret that technology can have a negative impact on children’s development, but, alarmingly, a new study suggests it might be doing much more harm than previously believed: A new study shows that 92 percent of children would prefer to play on their iPads rather than make fun of classmates with weird birthmarks. Yikes. This is not a good sign.  In a newly released study, researchers at Stanford found that, among children ages 5-10 who own iPads, an overwhelming 92 percent “strongly preferred” to play games and watch videos on their devices than to point out and laugh at freaky-looking birthmarks on their peers. Additionally, children who had access to an iPad equipped with YouTube were five times less likely than iPad-less children to point out another child in their vicinity and remark that their birthmark was shaped like a turd or looked like Michael Jackson.  “Technology is depriving kids today of many of the formative influences that shaped previous generations, including the vital socio-emotional experience of interacting face-to-face with a classmate who has a large dark blotch on their forehead,” said lead researcher Anton Bell. “These crucial experiences encourage a child to engage their curiosity through questions like ‘Did someone spill paint on your head?’ and they also help them develop the interpersonal skills they need to interact with strange-looking people as adults.” “It’s troubling to see hundreds of millions of children growing up so captivated by their devices that they completely miss out on enriching developmental experiences like spending an entire recess chasing a kid with a huge port wine stain around the playground and asking him if he’s morphing into Grimace or some other purple character,” Bell added.  Wow. Sad that this is what we’ve come to as a society! Even when the group of kids with iPads was egged on by researchers to say what they thought of a classmate’s big, ugly birthmark, each child spent on average only .83 seconds thinking of a remark such as “Yeah, it kinda looks weird” before quickly returning to their screens—a vast difference compared to the group who were not provided with iPads, who spent upwards of 30 minutes hurling insults like “Your birthmark’s so big they can see it from space,” and “Did you get that spot because your mom is a cow?” According to Bell, this indicates a serious issue for gadget-obsessed kids, who may not gain the social tools they’ll need later in life to bond with others through gossiping about a mutual friend’s weird hair or ugly boyfriend.  “It’s more important now than ever that kids step away from the screens and learn to really be present around other people so they can discern what’s funny about them,” Bell continued. “If they don’t figure out how to effectively call attention to peers’ imperfections at an early age, it can seriously stunt their development and make it difficult when they become adults to appropriately react when they encounter, say, a coworker with a gnarly skin tag over their eye that strikingly resembles a nipple.”  This is seriously troubling.  It seems as though the tech doomsayers were right: Our gadgets really are changing the way we function as a society, and not necessarily for the better. It’s time for parents to start limiting their kids’ screen time and teaching them the importance of occasionally chasing a kid with a prominent birthmark around the playground yelling “YOU’VE GOT THE DARK MARK!” Your child might initially be angry with you, but they’ll thank you years later when they’ve grown up into a happy, functional adult."
Ever The Showman: This Rhino At The Zoo Is Having Spectacular Diarrhea,N/A,https://clickhole.com/ever-the-showman-this-rhino-at-the-zoo-is-having-spectacular-diarrhea/,"If you happen to be at Omaha’s Henry Doorly Zoo right now, you’ll want to immediately beeline for the African Grasslands exhibit, as one of the animals is putting on a show for the ages: A rhino is having absolutely spectacular diarrhea. Awesome! It doesn’t get any more thrilling than this! Following a hearty breakfast of melons and cabbage heads eaten straight off the ground, Newton, a 23-year-old male white rhino, is currently unleashing a nigh-endless payload of hot fecal ejecta from his massive buttocks and down the back of his stout legs to the delight and awe of dozens of zoo-goers, many of whom are capturing each and every volcanic mud-burst on their cell phone cameras for posterity. With the cool poise of a veteran shitter who’s been using the bathroom in front of spectators for decades, Newton is squirting his chunky ass-broth like a seasoned pro, charming the sizable crowd with spirited groans and hammy stomping as he issues turd after softball-sized turd from his impressively dilated anus into an ever-growing pool of his own steaming sewage. It is a magnificent scene to behold.  In fact, so magnificent is the sight of Newton liberating his bowels that even some of the jaded zookeepers have stopped in their tracks to bear witness, gawking in wide-eyed wonder alongside giddy foreign tourists as the two-and-a-half ton bull sprays gallons of his rectal swill all over his enclosure, leaving Pollock-esque spatters of dookie slop all over everything within the nine-foot blast radius. Even the macaques in the neighboring pen appear transfixed, having paused their constant masturbatory shrieking to take in the foul and powerful display. When an animal the size of a minivan evicts a hot tub’s worth of noxious slop from its bowels, you can’t help but stop and marvel. Yep, visitors to the zoo are definitely getting their money’s worth today. What a riveting performance by a master practitioner of the eliminatory arts. There’s no shortcut to becoming this good—diarrhea of this caliber is only honed through years of experience curling pipe in front of live audiences. While we feel bad for the zoo employees who are going to have to work overtime to get this mudslide cleaned up, we mostly feel lucky and grateful to have been present for this extraordinary feat of colonic virtuosity that will undoubtedly linger in our memories and nostrils for the rest of our days. "
Awesome: Uber Just Launched A New ‘Follow That Car!’ Feature For Hard-Boiled Detectives Chasing Down Hunches In A City With Ugly Secrets Behind Every Closed Door,N/A,https://clickhole.com/awesome-uber-just-launched-a-new-follow-that-car-feature-for-hard-boiled-detectives-chasing-down-hunches-in-a-city-with-ugly-secrets-behind-every-closed-door/,"A notoriously tough profession is about to get a lot more convenient, because one of the leading rideshare companies has rolled out an amazing new feature with their unique needs in mind: Uber just launched a new “Follow that car!” feature for hard-boiled detectives chasing down hunches in a city with ugly secrets behind every closed door. Nice one, Uber! This is going to make life so much easier for world-weary gumshoes. As of today, a new option on the Uber app will let grizzled private investigators pay a nominal surcharge to have their drivers get the lead out and step on it after a mysterious vehicle trying to vanish back into the murky underbelly of a city where even devils fear to tread. Once detectives tick the “Follow that car!” box on their ride request, all they’ll have to do is enter a brief description of the car or simply snap a photograph of it, and their driver will take them on a white-knuckle pursuit through rain-slick streets to hunt down the answers they’re half-wondering if they even want to find. The feature is so far being tested in faceless cities where a deadly undertow of corruption churns beneath a mire of shattered dreams and broken promises, but Uber has plans to expand the service to smaller towns with wicked secrets that have a bad habit of staying kept as early as 2023. The “Follow that car!” feature really goes above and beyond to cater to rough-edged sleuths chasing down their last, best hope to unravel how a seemingly straight-laced young med student wound up in an abandoned meatpacking plant with a missing hand and two bullets in his neck. For instance, Uber will keep a handful of drivers on standby around cold crime scenes where detectives are likely to search for clues the cops may have overlooked—whether unknowingly or on purpose. These drivers will be ready to pick up detectives the second they recognize that the scarred man from the victim’s apartment complex is watching them from a beat up Miata, and riders will have full control over their windows in case they need to lean outside with their snubnosed .38 to shoot out the tires on the escaping vehicle. Best of all, Uber’s drivers will even have complimentary snacks and electrolyte-replenishing drinks on offer in case the detective’s quarry abandons their car for a foot chase down a narrow alley in the heart of Triad territory. Now THIS is how you take care of your customers! Reception among hardboiled detectives has so far been overwhelmingly positive, with many praising the feature for cutting through the veil of mystery shrouding the dark heart of this concrete Gomorrah like the fiery sword of some furious avenging angel. A few have complained about surge pricing on the “Follow that car!” feature after some dame goes and kicks the beehive by asking too many questions about her brother’s suspicious disappearance, but Uber plans to alleviate this by adding a group “Follow that car!” option where costs can be split between multiple steely investigators who realize that their seemingly unrelated cases are all tangled up in a grand web of conspiracy that goes all the way to the top. Wow, Uber has really pulled out all the stops with this new feature. Looks like Lyft is going to have to step up their game if they want to win back tireless private eyes who are on the cusp of busting this whole thing wide open! "
"That Isn’t Fucking For You, Dude: This Normal-Sized Man Is Sitting On A Toadstool",N/A,https://clickhole.com/that-isnt-fucking-for-you-dude-this-normal-sized-man-is-sitting-on-a-toadstool/,"Some entitled assholes just can’t wrap their heads around the idea that not everything in the world is meant for them, and here’s a story about one particularly egregious piece of shit that’ll really make your blood boil: This normal-sized man is sitting on a toadstool. Fucking hell, dude, can you seriously not see the problem here? Any tiny little forest sprites looking for a place to rest are apparently shit out of luck today, because this normal-sized son of a bitch has decided to shamelessly park his normal-sized ass on the only available toadstool in this idyllic forest grove. If he’d walked just another hundred feet he could have sat on a park bench that is explicitly designed with his proportions in mind, but no! He just had to stop right here and squat down on this toadstool, social etiquette be damned. Never mind the fact that said park bench is way too high up for any itty bitty woodland folk to sit on unless they get flown up by a friendly saw-whet owl—their hardships apparently don’t matter as long as this asshole gets his. Imagine being a miniscule, elderly gnome with a pointy red cap and curly white beard using a twig as a walking stick and hoping to find a place to catch your breath after a stressful morning getting chased by foxes, only to find this big dumbass sitting on the toadstool where you usually rest. Does he seriously not get how out of bounds this is given that he’s fucking 5’11”? That toadstool is very obviously intended as a place for wee folk to rest their little feet and sing a song about dandelions while they’re out taking their pet lady bug for a walk, but this prick doesn’t seem to have gotten the memo. He’s just scrolling through his phone with a slack jaw and dull, vacant eyes, completely oblivious to how hard he’s screwing over any tiny little guys tuckered out from a long day of play-wrestling bullfrogs. God, shit like this is absolutely infuriating. We’d like to march right up to this fucker and boot his keister clear off that toadstool so an actual little imp can perch on it to drink raindrops out of an acorn cap and eat the individual drupelets off a raspberry one by one. His parents clearly never taught him that you don’t take up an open toadstool if you’re taller than a candlestick—you leave a tiny crumb of cookie beside it so the little folk will bless your home and help you find lost keys and loose change. What do you want to bet this guy won’t even use his height to pluck down a pristine oak leaf when he finally gets up so the next little pixie to sit there can use it as a parasol? If anything, this inconsiderate prick will probably just plant his ass on a chipmunk’s back and try to ride it home, because why start acting your actual size now?!? Man, some fucking people. We’d like to apologize to the wee folk of the forest on behalf of all normal-sized humans, because the graceless dipshit taking up this toadstool truly represents the very worst of us."
Cynical Marketing Ploy: All The Brands Pretending To Give A Shit About Werewolves Will Go Just Back To Ignoring Their Existence The Second October Ends,N/A,https://clickhole.com/cynical-marketing-ploy-all-the-brands-pretending-to-give-a-shit-about-werewolves-will-go-just-back-to-ignoring-their-existence-the-second-october-ends/,"Every year around this time, you can hardly go five minutes without seeing an ad with a werewolf in it, and it can admittedly be nice to see such an overlooked population finally get some time in the spotlight. But the fact is that these werewolves are being used in Halloween-themed advertisements with the explicit goal of selling products around Halloween, and if you think these companies are going to follow through on this kind of representation the rest of the year or even the morning after Halloween, you’re in for a rude awakening, because, just like every year,  all the brands pretending to give a shit about werewolves will just go back to ignoring their existence the second October ends. Pardon us if we can’t get too excited about such a nakedly opportunistic cash grab. Far from earnestly championing a shift in the way society views lycanthropy, all these recent commercials where some smiling werewolf family piles into a minivan or a hairy, clawed hand reaches for a can of hard seltzer are just part of another marketing strategy that’s as fleeting as it is cynical. These brands will happily incorporate werewolves into their messaging for as long as it’s trendy, but once we hit November and it stops being profitable to show whatever burger or breakfast sandwich satiating the ravenous hunger of a werewolf draped in the tatters of his pre-transformation clothing, they’ll drop the entire demographic like a hot potato. The insincerity of their efforts is so transparent when you consider that they’re only airing these ads in big city markets that actually celebrate Halloween while ignoring the markets most affected by werewolf activity. How committed to celebrating polymorphs can these brands actually be if they won’t even acknowledge superstitious Estonian farming hamlets beset by a rash of missing livestock? Not very, it seems. Part of what makes these ads so frustrating is how false they ring in light of these companies’ own actions: Where the fuck was Nike when Vicar Almsridge led a torch-bearing mob of townsfolk to burn Greyfang Hollow last August? Why has Coke given a combined $200,000 to legislators trying to deregulate the sale of silver bullets? Does Netflix not realize they just released a standup special with a five minute anecdote about a clever peasant boy tricking a werewolf into swallowing a lambskin filled with hot coals? Hell, we’ve even seen a few brands throw around the outdated term “w*lfman” like it’s fucking 1589. And werewolves are supposed to just suck it up and pat corporations on the back for transparently attempting to cash in on lycanthrope identity while expecting them to quietly recede into the impenetrable dark of the woods for the other 11 months of the year? Fuck that, and fuck these brands for trying it. Look, we certainly don’t fault any werewolves who are excited to finally see ads that depict people with ancient Hungarian curses like their own howling in silhouette against a cloud-ringed moon, but we know damn well most werewolves would trade this empty pandering in a heartbeat for reliable access to the rare mountain herbs that can temporarily suppress transformation or the ability to eat at a restaurant without some psycho beasthunter pulling a crossbow on them. While the ads you’ll see this month may indicate meaningful social progress, they’ll never actively drive it, because capitalism fundamentally only values werewolves to the extent that it can commodify them. The only thing that will truly liberate werewolves is the same thing it’s always been: Overtaking the village garrison in a storm of teeth and claws to usher in an endless night enshrining beasthood as the ultimate law of the land. Man, these werewolf ads really do come and go like clockwork. Here’s hoping brands will start doing more to support werewolves year-round or at least fuck off with this obvious wolfwashing bullshit. "
‘It’s The Only Thing That Makes People Feel Good’: The American Psychiatric Association Has Announced That The Mental Health Of The Nation Is Entirely Dependent Upon The Quality Of HBO’s Sunday Night Programming,N/A,https://clickhole.com/its-the-only-thing-that-makes-people-feel-good-the-american-psychiatric-association-has-announced-that-the-mental-health-of-the-nation-is-entirely-dependent-upon-the-qualit/,"It’s common knowledge that in order to care for your mental health, you’ll need to exercise, get an adequate amount of sleep, and make time to relax, but there’s also a major factor that rides in the hands of a select group of television executives: The American Psychiatric Association just announced that the mental health of the nation is entirely dependent upon the quality of HBO’s Sunday night programming. Wow. Whoever’s in charge of TV development at HBO better realize the power they have over America’s mental stability.  After examining mental health statistics from the past three decades, the APA has found that America’s collective mental health is at its highest when HBO’s Sunday night lineup includes a beloved, critically acclaimed show like The Sopranos, Game Of Thrones, or The Leftovers, and at its lowest when the show in HBO’s Sunday night slot is something weaker and more forgettable, like Treme, Vinyl, or The Night Of. Citing that the network’s Sunday programming is “the only thing that makes people feel good,” the APA has announced that capping off a long week with some HBO is the primary thing keeping most Americans going, and when these shows are boring, many people begin to lose hope that life is worth living. The APA broke their findings down with an explanation of how HBO’s most recent shows played a role in the nation’s mental wellbeing: “When The White Lotus began airing this summer, many Americans felt an immediate increase in their happiness and self esteem, but as the show slowed down and lost its way, the nation began to feel lost as well,” explained the APA in a statement. “This trend in hopelessness continued for a few weeks until the trailer for Succession season 3 finally dropped, which led to a collective high in self-reported positivity not seen since the thrilling penultimate episode of Mare Of Easttown aired in the spring.”  The APA further warned that given the current situation regarding the pandemic, if the new season of Succession does not deliver, we may see such a severe drop in mental health that it correlates with an increase in suicidal ideation – something researchers have dubbed “The Crashing Effect,” due to the all time lows reached during the months when Pete Holmes’s Crashing took the Sunday night slot. This is incredibly sobering. HBO should definitely assemble their Sunday schedule with great care considering this news. Thanks to the APA for this enlightening information that helps explain why we feel the way we do!"
A Beautiful Mind: This Woman Is Able To Vividly Imagine Every Single Bad Thing That Could Possibly Happen To Her In The Future,N/A,https://clickhole.com/a-beautiful-mind-this-woman-is-able-to-vividly-imagine-every-single-bad-thing-that-could-possibly-happen-to-her-in-the-future/,"You might only be familiar with savants through movies and shows like Rainman and The Good Doctor, but there are actually real savants with extraordinary mental abilities living among us who possess a type of preternatural genius that rivals anything you’ll find in fiction. Case in point: This woman is able to vividly imagine every single bad thing that could possibly happen to her in the future. Wow. What a truly beautiful mind. Willa Highland of Madison, Wisconsin may look like your average 27-year-old woman, but she may in fact be one of the greatest minds the world has ever known thanks to her remarkable gift for envisioning thousands upon thousands of shockingly specific negative scenarios that could affect her at some point in the future. A simple five-minute walk down the block can prompt Willa to generate a dizzying array of fears, as her mind constantly scans her surroundings for potential crises, generating an endless feed of troubling patterns from the mundane. Within just seconds of walking out her front door, she can vividly picture a barrage of devastating scenarios befalling her, like a car careening onto the sidewalk and killing her, an exposed wire electrocuting her to death, and an acquaintance from childhood rushing up unexpectedly to let her know that an offhand dig she made at a classmate in grade school actually caused that classmate’s suicide.  Not only that, but even the most innocuous of things can send Willa into an anxiety spiral. One look at the sidewalk and she immediately imagines tripping and fracturing her knee, resulting in a diagnosis of early-onset osteoporosis, which would then cause her to end up confined to a wheelchair in her old age, leaving her unable to attend her future grandchildren’s soccer games and dance recitals, preventing her from forming a meaningful relationship with them, thereby compelling her, in an effort to be physically healthy enough to be more present in their lives, to undergo an elective knee replacement surgery, the bacterial complications from which ultimately cause her to die alone and unloved.    Amazing! What an unbelievable gift she has. However, though her ability might seem like a blessing, for Willa the non-stop barrage of frightening thoughts can often feel like a curse. Never can she stand at the top of the staircase without picturing herself becoming paralyzed in a fall, nor can she buy shampoo without stressing about one of its ingredients potentially being a hormone disruptor that causes her to develop Alzheimer’s. She can’t even pass an attractive man on the street without imagining falling in love with him and getting married, only for him to leave her at age 50 for a younger, more attractive woman, thus sending Willa into a grief-induced mental breakdown from which she never recovers.  In fact, one of Willa’s most unbelievable abilities may be her capacity to turn positive imagined situations into negative ones. For instance, a positive performance review at Willa’s architecture job last year caused her fear that if she becomes successful enough at her current firm, she’ll be entrusted with new responsibilities that become too overwhelming to manage, causing her to neglect her architecture work and lose the trust of her coworkers, ultimately leading to an all-out implosion of her professional life that carries over to her personal life, leaving her broke and unemployed and addicted to pills. Utterly brilliant! It’s hard to believe that someone is capable of such genius. Whether she’s picturing a friend’s dog biting her face off or imagining a new, even more sadistic version of the Golden State Killer making her his first victim on the one night a year she forgets to lock her window, Willa uses her prodigious talents with impressive frequency and skill. There is truly something special about this woman’s mind, and we are absolutely in awe."
Incredibly Depressing: This Man Uses Social Media To Connect With Others,N/A,https://clickhole.com/incredibly-depressing-this-man-uses-social-media-to-connect-with-others/,"If you’re the sensitive, empathic type, look away, because this story is such a downer you might never recover from it: This man uses social media to connect with others. Oof. No. This poor guy. Harry Renner of San Francisco, CA may seem like a regular 31-year-old man, but his life is much darker than it may seem: Every day, Harry attempts to use his Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook accounts to make genuine, person-to-person connections with friends, family, and even strangers. It would be one thing if Harry posted on Instagram to advertise for his business or promote some sort of show he was in—or even to just showcase a skill like photography or painting—but instead, the poor man simply puts up images of things like his building’s laundry room, with captions like “guess it’s laundry day again,” and then replies personally to every single comment, even if it’s just an emoji. The same goes for the other social platforms, too. Harry will send tweet after tweet about movies he’s seen to his favorite Vox critic despite never receiving a response, all the while remaining totally unaware that Twitter is supposed to be for posting strident, under-researched political opinions, cancelling coworkers or minor celebrities, or posting absurd jokes from an anonymous account with a weird, distorted profile picture. God, this is sad. If you want to stop reading here, we totally understand. It’s unclear whether Harry is lonely, confused, or just socially inept, but regardless, he remains an active Facebook user well past the site’s prime, posting full photo albums of his pretty bare-bones shelf-installation project with long descriptions of his process, which usually only garner comments from his most elderly relatives—comments that he, of course, replies to at length. It sure seems like Harry could pick up the phone and call or text some of the people he’s having these extended, public conversations with online, but for whatever reason, he chooses to be as active as a person could possibly be on social media, offering up post after post about inane daily activities that would be better saved for a journal. Whatever is going wrong on Harry’s end, it is definitely sad to watch him try to forge healthy, positive relationships with others on the various social media platforms. This is such a bummer. We wish someone would tell Harry that what he’s doing is at best weird, and at worst very, very hard to watch. Let’s hope he quits it soon and makes his long-awaited transition into being a normal dude!"
Prayers For The President: Joe Biden Has Been Rushed To Walter Reed Medical Center With A Case Of The Zoomies,N/A,https://clickhole.com/prayers-for-the-president-joe-biden-has-been-rushed-to-walter-reed-medical-center-with-a-case-of-the-zoomies/,"Please keep Joe Biden and his family in your thoughts and prayers today, as our nation’s commander in chief is currently receiving treatment following a serious health scare: President Biden has been rushed to the Walter Reed Medical Center with a case of the zoomies.  Stay strong, Joe.  According to an official statement, White House aides first noticed something was off during the president’s daily briefing, when Biden began exhibiting bursts of explosive energy, frantically zipping around the conference table and spinning in circles. Though Biden insisted he felt fine, his symptoms worsened as the day progressed, reportedly leaping over couches in the Oval Office and repeatedly sprinting in sharp figure eights around the furniture with his tongue wagging happily, occasionally stopping on a dime to sniff something in the carpet before dashing off again with renewed vigor. The decision was finally made to call a doctor after Biden started running up to various staffers with a rope toy in his mouth and nudging them with his head in hopes that they’d play tug of war with him, eventually getting so excited at the prospect of playing that he accidentally urinated on a rug.  White House physician Kevin O’Connor then arrived and checked the president’s vitals before letting him out onto the White House lawn, hoping that trotting a few laps around the property might help him burn off his excess energy. However, this only succeeded in riling the 78-year-old even more, to the point where he was kicking up large clods of grass and making a mess of the landscaping. It then became clear that the president’s zoomies weren’t going away, and the decision was made to crate Biden and medevac him to Walter Reed.  “If allowed to go untreated, the zoomies can result in serious injury or even death for someone the president’s age,” said O’Connor in a statement to the press, adding that, in his playful frenzy, Biden was at heightened risk of darting blindly out into traffic and getting hit by a car. “Luckily, President Biden is under the best medical care possible and has been responding well to the Trazodone we gave him in a piece of cheese. His condition has been upgraded to stable, and we believe it will only be a matter of hours before he tires from rolling around on the ground, wildly chasing squirrels, and eagerly presenting his belly to staffers so they’ll scratch him. Soon he’ll be administered a bully stick to help him calm down, and if we can lull him into taking a nice, long nap, we’re optimistic he’ll make a full recovery.”  Wow. Fingers crossed he pulls through! Kudos to the White House medical staff and the doctors at Walter Reed for working so hard to neutralize a scary situation. Hopefully the president’s zoomies subside soon so that he can get back to leading our nation. Get well, Joe!"
Bitch: This Woman Won’t Let Her Husband Go Eat Salt Water Taffy With The Boys,N/A,https://clickhole.com/bitch-this-woman-wont-let-her-husband-go-eat-salt-water-taffy-with-the-boys/,"Marriage always has its ups and downs, but just be thankful you’re not married to this lady from Brewster, MA, who is putting her husband through an ordeal that will make your blood absolutely boil: This woman won’t let her husband go eat salt water taffy with the boys. Is she fucking serious?! God, what a bitch. After a long day of work, there’s no better way to unwind than popping open a wholesale tub of salt water taffy and eating the entire thing in one sitting with the boys, which is precisely how Harold Salisbury, 56, intended to take the edge off after a particularly stressful day at the office today. But just as all the boys pulled up in a minivan outside Harold’s house to pick him up for another night of throwing back taffy after taffy and piggyback fighting down at a local dockyard, Harold’s wife, Patricia, randomly decided to be a huge bitch and forbid Harold from going.  “I feel like I’ve barely seen you lately. You come home from work, immediately go out with your friends, and don’t come back until well after midnight, sticky and reeking of salt water taffy,” Patricia nagged her husband. “You’ve spent $300 on taffy this week alone, Harold. Tonight, I’d like you to stay home. Is spending one evening with the kids and I honestly too much to ask? Please, go outside and tell your friends no salt water taffy tonight.” God DAMN, what a fucking ghoul. Why’s she gotta be so needy and controlling?! No matter how much Harold protested or explained that the boys were already parked outside waiting for him with a 5lb. bucket of assorted salt water taffy flavors—including root beer, his very favorite—the heartless hag refused to back down. Harold, realizing that he was fighting a losing battle, sulked his way out front towards the minivan, in which all his salt water taffy-eating buddies were blasting marching band music and giddily tucking in their shirts, and told the fellas he wouldn’t be able to hang.  Damn, what a bummer.  Strong male friendship is a rare and special thing, and for Patricia to forbid Harold from throwing back salt water taffy by the pound with all his closest buddies until the wee hours of the morning is truly an evil move. Men need these close relationships with buddies to help them cope with the endless misery of life, and by taking that away from Harold, Patricia is not only ruining his night but full-on waging a war against his mental health. Hopefully Harold leaves her soon, because no one deserves to be married to someone this wretched."
Latest Guidance: The CDC Is Asking Everyone Keep The Terrors And Frights To A Minimum This Halloween Because Everyone Is Already Pretty Scared,N/A,https://clickhole.com/latest-guidance-the-cdc-is-asking-everyone-keep-the-terrors-and-frights-to-a-minimum-this-halloween-because-everyone-is-already-pretty-scared/,"Since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, the CDC has been regularly providing the American public with guidance on how to safely navigate these difficult and frightening times. Now, as we enter the spookiest time of the year, the CDC is recommending that people keep the terrors and frights to a minimum this Halloween since everyone is already pretty scared as it is.   Yeah, guess that makes sense.  Citing research showing that fear and anxiety are at an all-time high due to the pandemic, growing social unrest, political divisions, and an uncertain economic future, the CDC is asking Americans of all ages to avoid hosting haunted houses or setting up graveyards on their lawn because no one really needs that scary shit right now on top of everything else. The CDC announced their new recommendations on Twitter in a series of tweets:     While following these recommendations would definitely take some fun out of the holiday, hopefully at this point in the pandemic Americans can understand the importance of making small sacrifices for the greater good. So, what do you think? Are you scared enough to feel like you need a frightless Halloween this year, or do you think this is yet another case of government overreach? Let us know in the comments!"

"Seems Like A Weak Choice, But Okay: Oxford English Dictionary Has Announced That Their Word Of The Year For 2021 Will Be ‘Worm’",N/A,https://clickhole.com/seems-like-a-weak-choice-but-okay-oxford-english-dictionary-has-announced-that-their-word-of-the-year-for-2021-will-be-worm/,"Every year, social media buzzes with excitement when the editors at Oxford English Dictionary choose a single dictionary entry as the most significant word of the annual cycle. But this time around, the whole thing seems like a bit of a letdown: Oxford English Dictionary has announced that their word of the year for 2021 will be “worm.” Huh. Worm. Feels like they could have picked something with a bit more oomph, no? Editors at OED, who historically have chosen words with unique cultural importance in a given year, such as “climate emergency” in 2020, announced this week that their official word of 2021 will be “worm,” defined as “any of numerous relatively small elongated usually naked and soft-bodied animals (such as a grub, pinworm, tapeworm, shipworm, or slowworm).” In a post on the OED website, the publishing company explained that the word “worm” was carefully selected by the Oxford Languages team due to its relevance to contemporary life, observing that “worms are all over the place” and “everybody loves a good worm.” “After several months spent culling a list of thousands of words vital to the modern English lexicon, we have decided that 2021 is best encompassed by ‘worm,’ a word which can be used in such powerful sentences as ‘Worms live in the dirt’ and ‘I stepped on a worm,’” the post read. “As 2021 comes to a close, we urge our dictionary readers to reflect on the significance of ‘worm’ and what it means to them, whether it be a nice slimy earthworm or more of a maggot-type thing.” Okay…you have to think there’s a word more relevant to 2021 than worm. Maybe “vaccine”? “Antibodies”? Something like that? The Word of The Year page on OED’s website even details the shortlist of words and phrases that were nearly chosen this year, which apparently included “big worm,” “dead worm,” and “wormlike”—all of which are pretty much on par with “worm” as far as being a bit out of left field goes. We’re not totally sure what was going on at OED this year, because if they were paying attention to what people are talking about they’d know that even something straightforward like “coronavirus” would be a stronger pick. Anyway, looks like we’re stuck with “worm” for this year, so let’s just make the best of it."
Not As Sharp As He Once Was: Q’s New Gadgets For James Bond Are All Just Different Colors And Sizes Of E-ZPass,N/A,https://clickhole.com/not-as-sharp-as-he-once-was-qs-new-gadgets-for-james-bond-are-all-just-different-colors-and-sizes-of-e-zpass/,"James Bond finally returned to theaters this weekend in No Time To Die, with Daniel Craig reprising the iconic role for his very last time. While fans and critics alike have largely had positive things to say about the latest offering, there’s one small element of the film that’s been widely criticized for falling short of high standards established by previous installments of the franchise: Q’s new gadgets for James Bond are all just different colors and sizes of E-ZPass.  Damn. That doesn’t seem useful for a British Secret Service agent at all. Those who have had a chance to see No Time To Die have come away underwhelmed by the film’s depiction of Q, the head of MI6’s research and development branch (played by Ben Whishaw), who in this latest 007 flick seems to have lost his flair for inventive gadgets and weaponry, instead supplying Bond with an unorganized pile of various E-ZPass transponders that provide no real value in the world of high-stakes undercover intelligence. The dozen or so E-ZPasses—which Q didn’t even put in a storage container, meaning Bond would inconveniently have to carry them all around bulging out of his suit pockets during chases and fights—range from older to newer models, and some have been crudely colored with permanent marker. When Bond asks Q what kind of scenario a 5’ x 2’ E-ZPass with a Halloween color theme would come in handy for, Q scratches his head, stutters a bit, and then unconvincingly mutters, “You’ll thank me later, Bond.” The scene continues as Q brings Bond to a ballistics testing room containing a single toll booth to demonstrate how the E-ZPasses work, despite Bond’s repeated insistence that he knows what an E-ZPass is. After Bond seamlessly walks through the “E-ZPASS ONLY – NO CASH” toll and Q smiles at Bond with a knowing grin, Bond asks, “Wait, does E-ZPass even exist outside of the states? My mission’s taking me to Norway, Italy, and Cuba. You’re aware of this right?” Q’s smile instantly disappears as he dejectedly fiddles with a rainbow-colored E-ZPass and responds, “an MI6 agent should always expect the unexpected…” in another unconvincing bid to sound clever. Oof. Seems like Q has really lost his touch.  What a big waste of Bond’s time and a major whiff for Q. Hopefully 007 wasn’t relying on Q’s gadgetry to complete his mission, because this has got to be the most useless technology Q has ever come up with. Fingers crossed that the creators of the Bond series will listen to viewer feedback and restore Q to his former glory in future installments of the franchise. "
Forging A Solo Career: Mookie Betts Has Left The Dodgers To Play Baseball By Himself,N/A,https://clickhole.com/forging-a-solo-career-mookie-betts-has-left-the-dodgers-to-play-baseball-by-himself/,"The MLB playoffs are in full swing, but with a do-or-die game Thursday set to determine who will take on the Atlanta Braves for the National League championship, it looks like one of the teams fighting for their season will now have to do so without one of their biggest stars: Mookie Betts has left the LA Dodgers to start a solo career playing baseball by himself.    Wow! While this is undoubtedly bad news for the Dodgers, it’s great to see Betts pursuing his dreams.  In a statement released through his agent earlier today, the five-time all star announced that he’s resigning from the Dodgers effective immediately and will instead continue his professional baseball career as a solo player, allowing him the freedom to play the game in a way he’s always dreamed of but has never been able to under the MLB rulebook. From now on, Betts says he will play the sport by and against himself, exploring never-before-tried techniques and gameplay elements such as dribbling, scoring based on home run distance, the option to wear shorts, running bases in nontraditional order, and something he calls “the Ultimate Bunt Gauntlet.”   “I’m forever grateful for my years with Major League Baseball and all the opportunities it’s afforded, but it’s time for me to begin playing the game I love on my own terms,” explained Betts. “Though stepping away from my team in the heat of the pennant chase was not an easy decision, I have so many ideas for the sport that just aren’t feasible within a team dynamic. The kind of baseball I want to play requires creative flexibility. I need the freedom to try innovative new things like playing with multiple baseballs at once, pitching from different spots on the field, replacing the warning track with quicksand, in-game gambling, far more opportunities to hit dingers, and many other exciting new ideas that I’ll finally be able to try out as a solo act.” While it’s still unclear exactly what playing as a one-man franchise will look like, we should get some clarity soon, as Betts says he plans to immediately begin playing solo baseball as the Nashville Bison—a name he chose on account of his Tennessee roots and his incorrect assertion that “bison are the only kind of animal a team hasn’t been named after yet.” Betts says he also plans on designing his own uniform, which he claims will be “sleeker, with more hidden compartments and gadgets” than existing MLB get-ups but will “still have a belt,” adding with no additional explanation that “it isn’t baseball if there isn’t a belt—I cannot stress this enough.”  Interesting! Sounds like he is very passionate about belts.    It’ll be awesome to see Betts have the chance to flex his MVP chops without other players or coaches holding him back. Time will tell if this move pays off for him, but we wish him all the luck in the world! Go Mookie!"
Didn’t Age Well: HBO Max Is Pulling The Episode Of ‘Friends’ Where Chandler Unhinges His Jaw And Emits One Million Metric Tons Of Carbon Pollution,N/A,https://clickhole.com/didnt-age-well-hbo-max-is-pulling-the-episode-of-friends-where-chandler-unhinges-his-jaw-and-emits-one-million-metric-tons-of-carbon-pollution/,"In recent years, many iconic shows from the 90s and early 00s have drawn criticism from fans who are now realizing how outdated and cringeworthy the humor is under a modern lens, and now one of the most popular sitcoms of all time is finally facing a reckoning of its own: HBO Max is pulling the episode of Friends where Chandler unhinges his jaw and emits one million metric tons of carbon pollution.  Yikes. Think we can all agree that one didn’t age very well. Longtime fans of the beloved television show may remember the Season 4 episode titled “The One Where Chandler Greatly Accelerates Global Warming,” where the group is stuck at Central Perk while the New York City Earth Day parade is passing by outside. When an attractive climate activist pops in for a coffee, Joey and Chandler immediately begin competing for her attention, with Joey laying down his classic line “How you doin?” That’s when the less-than-smooth Chandler opens his mouth to speak, but instead discharges a towering black plume of noxious smoke that quickly fills the coffee shop with deadly levels of greenhouse gas, screwing up both of their chances with the environmentalist. Woof. It must’ve seemed pretty funny at the time when Chandler belched out more CO2 in two minutes than 200,000 cars would emit in an entire year while massive gas flares roared out of his ears and crude oil seeped from his pores, but it’s definitely uncomfortable to watch now that society is less tolerant of wanton acts of environmental destruction. “Chandler’s quick-witted sarcasm and awkward charm made it a dream role to play, but I regret that scene where I run down the street with heavy smog billowing from my cartoonishly wide open mouth as passersby choke on the poisonous air and thousands of birds drop dead from the sky,” Matthew Perry wrote in an Instagram post addressing the matter. “Back then, joking around about spewing toxic fumes through your trap with the force of a coal-powered smokestack wasn’t considered offensive. But I’ve grown and matured since then, and I can now see why there is absolutely nothing funny about my character literally tearing a new hole in the ozone by spewing a whirling tower of lethal gas directly into the atmosphere, blanketing New York City in a dark, unbreathable fog that triggered dozens of miscarriages and ultimately caused a widespread shortage of oxygen at local hospitals.” “At the time, it seemed funny when the attractive climate activist dropped to the ground and started convulsing after inhaling the terrifying fog, prompting my character to quip, ‘So does this mean you won’t give me your number?’ but now I realize this is not the case,” he continued. “I apologize for my ignorance, and I vow to never again play a role that requires me to single-handedly accelerate the timeline for a global climate apocalypse.” Shortly after the news broke that HBO Max was pulling the Friends episode, clips began to surface on social media that make it abundantly clear why it was canned. In one, Gunther sticks his entire head inside Chandler’s mouth to stop the pollution but emerges moments later as a skeleton, the smoke having melted the flesh clean from his skull. In another, the studio audience roars with laughter as Ross rips his lungs out of his chest to check for carbon dioxide poisoning only to find the missing keys he’d been searching for in an earlier scene. There’s even a moment where Phoebe sings a rendition of “Smelly Cat” called “Pollution Chandler” and then kicks over a wind turbine. Oof. There is absolutely no way jokes like this would fly today. While some later storylines may not make sense without the episode––like when Rachel disappeared for eight months because Chandler’s pollution inspired her to open a Tunisian sweatshop, or the time then-Vice President Al Gore spanked Chandler––it was definitely a good call for HBO Max to remove it. At least there are still over 200 other episodes of Friends that you can watch where no one from the Central Perk gang is depicted with their mouth agape as 50,000 times more carbon pollution than the average person emits in their entire lifetime billows into the sky, signifying certain doom."
Put Them In A Home First Chance You Get: Your Parents Somehow Thought It Would Be Nice To Blow Up The Childhood Photo Of You And Your Cousin Kissing And Hang It Above Their Fireplace ,N/A,https://clickhole.com/put-them-in-a-home-first-chance-you-get-your-parents-somehow-thought-it-would-be-nice-to-blow-up-the-childhood-photo-of-you-and-your-cousin-kissing-and-hang-it-above-their-fireplace/,"They may have loved and cared for you all your life, but your mom and dad just made an absolutely confounding move that’s single-handedly bought them one-way tickets to a nursing home in the not-too-distant future: Your parents somehow thought it would be nice to blow up the childhood photo of you and your cousin kissing and hang it above their fireplace.  Yeah…this isn’t something that people of sound mind do. Your parents are losing it.  What was supposed to be a casual visit home this week turned into an upsetting pageant of senility after you discovered a 48” x 36” childhood photo of you and your cousin kissing each other on the lips boldly displayed right above your parents’ living room fireplace—an absolutely batshit design choice that made it 100 percent clear that your parents need to be surrendered to a senior living facility ASAP. Your mom, who showed you the photo under the impression it was a cute surprise, explained that, after “enhancing” the image with a shitty filter that made it look like it was from a graphic novel, she paid a local print shop $200 to have the picture enlarged and framed, unaware that $200 is only a fraction of the price she’ll eventually pay for this decision once you take away her car and her freedom and ship her off to spend her remaining days in a piss-soaked zoo for the hopelessly old.  The photo may be totally innocent, but the fact that you and your blood-relative cousin are kissing on the lips only drives home how insane it is that your parents chose to display it in the most prominent focal point in the entire house. While anybody else would find the picture’s contents and sheer size to be a perplexing, if not disturbing, choice as centerpiece wall art, your parents were too blinded by warm sentimental feelings to foresee that this mistake would ultimately mark the beginning of the end of their lives as independent adults.  What a shame. Would’ve figured they had at least another five, ten years before they started losing it, but nope.  Hopefully you can convince your parents to take the massive picture down before they throw a family party and it becomes a talking point at some holiday gathering. Neither you or your cousin wants this, and if your parents knew the extent to which this picture was determining the timeline for when they get locked away in a home, they wouldn’t want it anymore either.

Awesome! Tinder Will Now Warn You If The Person You’re Talking To Is One Of Those People Who Aren’t Friendless Per Se But Are Clearly Not Really Liked By Anyone,N/A,https://clickhole.com/awesome-tinder-will-now-warn-you-if-the-person-youre-talking-to-is-one-of-those-people-who-arent-friendless-per-se-but-are-clearly-not-really-liked-by-anyone/,"When you’re online dating, it can be hard to verify details about the people you’re matching with, but thankfully, one dating app has stepped up with an awesome new feature that’s going to go a long way toward making sure you’re not spending your time on the wrong people: Tinder will now warn you if the person you’re talking to is one of those people who aren’t friendless per se but are clearly not really liked by anyone.  Hell yes! This is going to be hugely helpful! Beginning this week, Tinder will give you a heads up if the cutie you’ve been messaging is one of those people who definitely come across as pretty normal at first, but are actually someone who is just generally disliked by everyone they know. If Tinder’s algorithm confirms that the reason the person you matched with doesn’t have any photos with friends on their profile is because their friends don’t like them enough to pose with them, you’ll receive a notification that reads, “FYI, this person does have friends, but they only really hang out if this person asks them to, so you know what that means….” “Normally, it can take months of dating someone before you meet their friends and realize that they’re really only hanging with your significant other because they’re too polite to tell them off, just generally ignoring them as much as possible and giving them the kind of half-hearted pity laughs that you’d only give to someone you think kind of sucks,” explained Tinder in a press release. “By letting people know this up top, we hope to prevent people from spending months of their life with someone whose so-called ‘best friend’ would actually describe them as an acquaintance at best.” So cool! This is a total game-changer. Tinder added that the reason this feature gives you a warning and doesn’t automatically unmatch you with the semi-friendless person is because this isn’t a dealbreaker for everyone. In fact, the company acknowledges that in some cases, both people messaging each other have barely made the guest list of every wedding they’ve ever attended. If that’s the case, Tinder says that the users will instead receive a push notification that the person they’re talking to is almost certainly their perfect match. This is so awesome! Who knew it could be this easy to discover that you’re with someone who everyone else reluctantly tolerates? Your move, Bumble!"
God Has Smiled On Us This Day! The Dude In This Tommy Hilfiger Ad Is Absolutely Packing,N/A,https://clickhole.com/god-has-smiled-on-us-this-day-the-dude-in-this-tommy-hilfiger-ad-is-absolutely-packing/,"Rejoice, brothers and sisters, for God has rewarded our faithfulness this day with a blessing beyond compare: The dude in this Tommy Hilfiger ad is absolutely packing. Hallelujah, what a hog! Thy rod and thy staff truly do comfort us!  Our daily acts of praise and devotion have not gone unnoticed by our Holy Lord above, and today He has seen fit to bestow His heavenly gifts on us through this marvelous Tommy Hilfiger ad of an underwear model, loins barely girded, rocking an eye-popping, Kilimanjaro-esque bulge. This monster-cocked Adonis is as clear a sign of God’s love as any believer could ever ask for, and one look at his garments struggling to contain the prodigious manmeat is all we need to know that we live in the embrace of a truly benevolent creator. As God once spoke to Moses through a burning bush, so now He speaks to us through this Tommy Hilfiger model’s 10 righteous inches, and His message is as loud and clear as a thousand Heavenly trumpets: Sons of Adam, Daughters of Eve, be glad, for it is the day of harvest, and this well-hung servant’s field has grown full with fruit. O, to be a laborer in his vineyard!  Indeed, we must praise God who brings relief from seasons of desolation and bids our sorrows cease with such gifts as this image of a veiny, prostrate member, with proportions like that of a donkey, robed in splendor for all nations to behold. If there was any doubt lingering in your heart as to the grace and might of our Creator, let ol’ Jumbo here’s sequoia-like endowment drive those fears from your breast at once! Though this is but a small taste of the eternal reward awaiting all God’s elect, that’s pretty much the only thing “small” about the python hitching a ride on the front of this fellow’s body. You think this gentleman ever gets stopped at the supermarket on suspicion of shoplifting a butternut squash in his trousers? Through God’s love, we believe with faith unwavering that he does. Let every tribe and every tongue cry hosanna to God on high for showing us this glorious wang! Looking at this ad, one can almost feel the hand of God guiding Tommy Hilfiger’s talent scouts towards this freak-dicked hunk, then guiding the photographer’s camera down at that rib-tickling flesh baguette, so that all nations might know the throbbing wonders of that which was made in His image. Our time on earth is made truly full by God’s willingness, in His limitless beneficence, to show us a clothing model so hung that even a 2D image of his junk makes us reflexively duck out of the way as if it’s going to pounce forth and slap us across the brow with its rubbery heft.  Praise be to God for blessing us with this impressive skin hose and the salvation with which it gushes, just as he did for Ezekiel, with dry bones becoming as flesh, revealing His favor unto His chosen. How amazing to consider that the hands that sculpted this spectacular tube are the same that scattered the stars above and formed the earth below! How awesome His power to have crafted this perfect dong, this brave helmeted horseman riding triumphantly into our most private of thoughts, spreading testimony of God’s goodness through great ejaculatory bursts of acclamation! Amen!  When the day comes that we finally meet our maker in His heaven above, we can’t wait to sidle up to Him at His throne, point down at this Tommy Hilfiger ad, and ask, “What in the hell do you think this guy feeds that thing?” to which He’ll gently reply, “Peanuts, my son,” leaving you awed by His infinite wisdom. Thanks be to God for our time in this world to enjoy gawking at photos of all the gargantuan studs it contains!  "
Ready To Feel Old?! The Deadline You Set For Yourself To Quit Your Job And Finally Start Living On Your Own Terms Already Passed Three Years Ago!,N/A,https://clickhole.com/ready-to-feel-old-the-deadline-you-set-for-yourself-to-quit-your-job-and-finally-start-living-on-your-own-terms-already-passed-three-years-ago/,"The older you get, the faster time flies. Need proof? Here’s a throwback that’ll truly put your age into perspective: The deadline you set for yourself to quit your job and finally start living on your own terms already passed three years ago! Wow, has it really been three years?!?  Remember that pledge you made to yourself to quit your job after the summer was over? You probably recall how much conviction you’d felt about leaving your company, and how ready you were to start fresh and do work that didn’t make you miserable every day. You had it all planned out: You were going to save up just a little more money, tell your boss off, and then take your time finding whatever came next, because you’d sworn to yourself that you’d start prioritizing the things that made you happy instead of basing your life decisions around a career. It was up to you to create the life you wanted to live, and after giving yourself a hard Labor Day deadline, you were going to put in your two weeks notice, not delaying the fulfillment of your own values, hopes, and dreams a moment longer. You were young, single, financially stable, and totally free to make major life changes without any serious risk. Basically, you were at the perfect point in your life to take a big leap, and the signs could not have been any clearer.  Well, believe it or not, that deadline was three whole years ago—way back in 2018! What’s even more incredible is that you’re still at that very same job you were once so adamant about quitting even if it meant doing so without another gig lined up! In fact, it’s been so long that nearly all your coworkers from back then have left the company, and many of the things that used to frustrate you about the job have since been replaced by new things that are even more frustrating, making your work life even more demoralizing than ever! Though to be fair, these past few years have really flown by, to the point where you might not even realize just how much time has passed until you sit down and consider how many exciting things you could’ve accomplished in three years but have utterly failed to, whether traveling the world, getting fit, tackling creative projects, starting new hobbies, getting a masters degree, pursuing your dream career, or literally anything you set your mind to. There was, to be clear, absolutely nothing holding you back except your own fear and cowardice.  Mind. Officially. Blown. Makes you feel ancient, doesn’t it? It’s such a cliche, but it’s nonetheless very true: Time goes by in the blink of an eye. Though it’s only been three years, it really does feel like a lifetime has gone by since you started working up your courage to quit your job and chase your dreams only to ultimately chicken out and settle for an unhappy, unfulfilled existence. One thing for certain is that the years are only going to fly by even faster, and soon enough, you’ll be wondering how the heck 10 years have passed since you promised yourself you’d stop wasting your life and leave your soul-sucking job for good. So crazy!"

Total Alpha Move: This Man Just Let The AC Repairman Know He Would Have Fixed The AC Himself If He Knew How  ,N/A,https://clickhole.com/total-alpha-move-this-man-just-let-the-ac-repairman-know-he-would-have-fixed-the-ac-himself-if-he-knew-how/,"Some men are just natural-born alphas, seemingly hardwired in their DNA to step up to challenges and take charge of difficult situations. Here’s a story of one such man who, not wanting to appear as if he was some weak-kneed beta cuck, asserted his unbridled masculinity in a truly impressive way: This man just let the AC repairman he called to fix his unit know that he totally would have fixed it himself if he knew how. Boom! What a total alpha move. Thirty-seven-year-old Kyle Morrison is the type of big-dicked man’s man who isn’t shy about putting lesser men in their place. So when he had to call a local HVAC company to come take a look at his central air because it was blowing hot air and filling the house with an odd smell, he had no qualms about establishing dominance by letting the repairman know that he would have tackled the repair himself if he wasn’t completely incapable of doing so. “I would’ve totally fixed it on my own, but I just haven’t had time to learn how because I’ve been really busy lately closing some big deals at work,” Morrison explained as he led the highly experienced expert repairman outside to the AC condenser, which he referred to as the “big fan thingy.” “I’m guessing it must be a wear-and-tear issue since I’ve been really diligent about maintenance. Like, I swap out the air filter probably three times a year, and I changed the batteries on the thermostat not that long ago. And it’s a really good Nest one, too—I paid, like, $300 for it, so definitely not a thermostat issue.”   “It’s not a blower issue, either,” Morrison added, explaining that, being the ultimate handyman-type he is, he had already put his hand over one of the air vents in his kitchen to make sure air was still coming out—a real top-dog move that likely saved him $50 in the additional labor it would’ve required for the repairman to investigate it himself.  Though he didn’t have the time or knowhow to fully diagnose the problem on his own, Morrison’s familiarity with changing air filters made it clear that he wasn’t just some clueless beta rube, and it was obvious that he could’ve tackled the job himself if he’d only had the years of professional training and experience servicing cooling systems that the repairman had. “Let me know if you need me to shut off the breaker or anything,” said Morrison while the repairman expertly disassembled the condenser unit, thereby subtly establishing that he was the sort of DIY man’s man who’s knowledgeable in complex technical matters such as the location of his home’s breaker switches.  While the repairman was undoubtedly impressed by Morrison’s familiarity with circuit breakers, he later probably felt a bit threatened—if not downright emasculated—when, upon realizing he’d left a tool he needed in his truck, Morrison stepped in like the boss he is and offered use of his 100-piece Craftsman all-in-one tool kit, which, though he’d only ever used one screwdriver from it in the two years he’s owned it, contained an intimidating array of specialized tools that only a real fuckin’ alpha would own.     Then, to make sure that the repairman knew what kind of top-of-the-food-chain silverback he was dealing with, Morrison continued to hover over him while he worked, at one point interrupting him as he replaced the AC unit’s coils to boast, “Damn, that looks even easier than I thought. I could’ve knocked that out in no time—piece of cake.” Then, as the repairman wrapped up his work and began putting away his gear, Morrison double-checked that he hadn’t charged him for assessing the blower or the air filters, as, again, Morrison had already done those things before he arrived and therefore should not have to pay for them.   Badass! This man is marking his territory like a goddamned champion, and we are so here for it. Kudos to Morrison for coming out of this situation with his manhood fully intact. Lesser men may have just handed over their man card to the repairman the second he showed up at the door, but not Morrison. This absolute king would have tackled the AC repair himself if he had the knowledge, skill, and equipment to do so, and the repairman undoubtedly knew this and felt deep respect for Morrison as he drove away with a $1,368 check for the two hours of work he’d done for him."
Risky Move: This Guy Posted An Open Invitation On Facebook For Anyone Who Wants To Go To A Concert With Him,N/A,https://clickhole.com/risky-move-this-guy-posted-an-open-invitation-on-facebook-for-anyone-who-wants-to-go-to-a-concert-with-him/,"While it’s true in life that with great risk comes great reward, there’s a fine line between making a calculated risk and taking a reckless gamble, and here’s a story of someone who’s definitely erring on the side of recklessness with a truly ill-advised leap of faith: This guy posted an open invitation on Facebook for anyone who wants to go to a concert with him.  Damn, this is a seriously bold move—and one that honestly probably won’t pay off.  Late yesterday, Raymond Sill, 33, posted a status announcing he’d bought two tickets to an upcoming Foo Fighters show, and that anybody—meaning literally any one of the hundreds of Facebook friends he’s amassed since making an account in 2009—who’s interested in joining him is more than welcome to come along. Apparently unfazed by the possibility that his offer is taken up by some random weirdo he barely knew in high school or some socially awkward ex-coworker from a previous job, or, even worse, the depressing potential that no one reaches out or engages with his status at all, Raymond’s brassy wager is one that most people would not have the stomach for. The safest move would be to simply message his close friends privately and see if any of them are interested, but perhaps Raymond just doesn’t have that many close friends, and this was legitimately his best shot at finding a concert buddy. Whatever the case, going public with this invite is a seriously ballsy move, and one that has a high chance of coming back to bite him in the ass. There are so many ways this could go wrong that you have to wonder what Raymond’s idea of a best case scenario here is. What did he hope would happen by making the invitation public on Facebook? Does he not understand that this is no longer the Facebook of 2006, when the goal was to genuinely connect with new people and form friendships? Because it’s 2021 now, and a precarious play like this will likely come off as sad or needy to anyone who encounters it on their newsfeed. It’s just hard to imagine this panning out in his favor.  But hopefully things nonetheless end up working out for Raymond and that he doesn’t feel bad when his invite inevitably fails to result in the unforgettable concert experience he’s probably hoping for. Worst case scenario, he can always lie to the person who accepts the invitation and say the extra ticket’s already been claimed, because going to the show alone would be less of an L than going to the show with a freak. Best of luck, Raymond!"
The Upside To Climate Change: A Hurricane That Wipes Out New Orleans Could Help Save Thousands Of People From Bachelorette Parties They’d Rather Not Shell Out For,N/A,https://clickhole.com/the-upside-to-climate-change-a-hurricane-that-wipes-out-new-orleans-could-help-save-thousands-of-people-from-bachelorette-parties-theyd-rather-not-shell-out-for/,"It feels like every day now there’s a grim new story about global warming and the unavoidable devastation it will wreak on mankind, and at this point it seems like there is very little cause for optimism. However, you shouldn’t yet abandon all hope, because there’s at least one small benefit to the impending climate apocalypse: A hurricane that wipes out New Orleans could save thousands of people from bachelorette parties they’d rather not shell out for. Hey, we’ll take it! When rising sea levels inevitably destroy the world’s coastal cities, this’ll be a nice little silver lining. Researchers at the EPA recently released predictions as to how climate change could affect Louisiana over the next decade, concluding that heavier rainfall and increased instances of flooding could easily lead to the permanent cancellation of hundreds of the long, exhausting, $1,000-a-person bachelorette weekends many Americans have steeled themselves for in the coming years. The climate scientists’ projections suggest that, without a drastic global effort to dramatically cut down carbon emissions, these painful, annoying, and unnecessarily dramatic four-day trips may be eradicated entirely by the year 2050. “There is a strong likelihood that climate change will severely limit the amount of Americans per year who are forced to get drunk on tequila shots in an ‘I’m With The Bride’ t-shirt on one of those moving bars with the bike pedals, screaming ‘We love you Jessica’ at their friend in a veil while everyone in the French Quarter stares at them like they’re fucking idiots,” said EPA climate researcher Ellen Tabor. “Even within the next five years, the increasing intensity and frequency of storms could have a noticeable impact on the number of bachelorette parties descending on Bourbon Street, potentially leading to a rise in much chiller, less expensive weekend getaways to cities like Montreal and Boulder, Colorado.” Tabor went on to explain that surging carbon emissions are already leaving New Orleans more vulnerable to volatile weather, resulting in an environment that’s increasingly inhospitable to   showing up with a group of 12 embarrassingly loud friends from Ohio and drunkenly deciding to go on some sort of “plantation tour” that no one in the group will show appropriate respect for and everyone will regret attending. And radical disruptions to Louisiana’s delicate swamp ecosystems will also likely result in a steep drop in the number of millennial tourists who, too hungover to continue drinking but adamant on keeping the bachelorette party going, buy Groupons for miserable, hours-long wetland tours in rickety-looking fan boats piloted by grizzled old locals who feed alligators marshmallows to make them do tricks in hopes of getting tips from passengers. Yep, bachelorette parties like these are definitely not something we’ll miss from the Before Times. Climate change is changing our world for the worse in many ways, but this might be one way in which it’s actually kind of doing us a solid. That said, we should all still be doing everything we can to reduce carbon emissions and combat global warming. But when everything goes to shit, there’ll definitely be no shame in celebrating all the shitshow bachelorette parties that get cancelled as a result."

A Man Ahead Of His Time: Newly Discovered Journals Show That Leonardo da Vinci Designed A Rudimentary Version Of Lil Wayne Way Back In 1497,N/A,https://clickhole.com/a-man-ahead-of-his-time-newly-discovered-journals-show-that-leonardo-da-vinci-designed-a-rudimentary-version-of-lil-wayne-way-back-in-1497/,"Leonardo da Vinci remains one of the greatest thinkers humanity has ever produced. The polymath was famed for his technological ingenuity, having conceptualized flying machines, solar power, and adding machines hundreds of years before they became a reality. Now, a recent anthropological find proves just how ahead of his time he really was: Newly discovered journals show that da Vinci designed a rudimentary version of Lil Wayne back in 1497. What an absolute visionary. The notebooks, found during a renovation of a Milan studio da Vinci worked out of in the 1490s, contained a variety of previously unseen writing, sketches, and schematics, including a rough draft of what the artist titled “Piccolo Wanzo,” an early conceptualization of what we know today as Lil Wayne. Da Vinci’s sketch bears such a startling resemblance to the rapper that it feels almost prophetic, especially considering that people living in his time would’ve had no knowledge of hip hop or its central figures.  Da Vinci’s notes describe Piccolo Wanzo as a “vulgar songster” with “locks like that of rope” and a “mouth that glimmers with jewels,” who harbors a “fondness for port and opium” and “sings foul rhyming carols at a rapid clip” in a voice that “groans like corroded wheels of iron.” The similarities are uncanny, although Piccolo Wanzo does diverge in several ways from Lil Wayne as we know him today, as da Vinci describes his creation as having “anatomy hewn of bronze” so that in wartime he can be “occasioned for the front lines of battle to deflect enemy artillery with his impenetrable torso.” Da Vinci also describes Piccolo Wanzo as a “spirited eunuch” who “takes the utmost pride in the smooth topography of his groin”—a marked difference from the real Lil Wayne and his gratuitous lyrical references to his genitals. Yet despite these discrepancies, the prescience of da Vinci’s design is still almost beyond belief.  “That Leonardo conceived the notion of a Lil Wayne in the 15th century—centuries before Weezy was even a possibility—just further proves the magnitude of his genius,” said da Vinci scholar Lena Russo. “Like many of his mechanical ideations, no models of Piccolo Wanzo were ever commissioned, as few, if any, of da Vinci’s contemporaries would’ve even understood the concept or seen any purpose in it. Da Vinci really was about 500 years ahead of the curve on this one. No one else in the Renaissance era could see the value in a Lil Wayne.”   Wow!  It’s deeply inspiring how, even after all these hundreds of years, mankind is still catching up with da Vinci’s extraordinary imagination. It’s remarkable to think that the same mind that gave us the Mona Lisa also envisioned the future of music centuries before the rest of the world, and we should all be grateful that we can still see and enjoy his work.

Major Backfire: A GOP Led Investigation Into Discrimination Against White People Has Concluded Nothing Except That Calling Someone A Honky Is Actually Very Funny,N/A,https://clickhole.com/major-backfire-a-gop-led-investigation-into-discrimination-against-white-people-has-concluded-nothing-except-that-calling-someone-a-honky-is-actually-very-funny/,"You’ve gotta think senate Republicans are kicking themselves right now, because they just gave up a spectacular own-goal on one of conservatism’s main planks: A GOP-led investigation into discrimination against white people has concluded nothing except that calling someone a honky is actually very funny. This is a real unforced error for the American right. After decades of assertions that efforts to reduce racial inequality in the United States were functionally resulting in unconstitutional discrimination against white Americans, an investigation helmed by prominent GOP policymakers managed to find no substantial evidence for anything other than calling someone a honky being a legitimately evergreen comedic bit. The investigation’s results were presented by senate Republicans attempting to derail a special hearing on discrimination actually faced by minority groups in the US, and though the rightwing lawmakers attempted to frame their findings as harrowing proof of widespread prejudice against white people, they instead succeeded only in inadvertently demonstrating that things like a white diner being referred to on their check as “TALL HONKY” or a white person’s car being called “The Honkymobile” are comedy gold, while further conclusions about anti-white discrimination simply could not be reached from the evidence available. Republican Sen. Josh Hawley led off the proceedings by gravely presenting the results of a poll given to white Americans which found that dozens of respondents had recently been called a honky, ignoring the fact that the same poll indicated that thousands said they hadn’t but would like to be, probably because being called a honky doesn’t sting like a real racial slur and is instead just a guaranteed full-on belly laugh for everyone involved anytime it happens. Hawley then recounted a supposedly harrowing anecdote from his youth in which his nametag a school event was altered to read “Hello, my name is JOSH HONKY,” which he treated like a big deal even though it clearly didn’t negatively affect his life in any meaningful way and mostly just made everybody listening giggle. When Chuck Schumer requested an opportunity for rebuttal, Hawley somberly asked how he’d feel if he were to answer “The honky from New York has the floor,” causing Schumer to use all of his allotted time cracking up at how extremely fucking good that shit was. Ouch, this is not the kind of result Republicans were looking for ahead of the midterms. “Reckless liberal policies have left white Americans facing marked disadvantages in colleges and workplaces around the country, and I should know. When I was a student at Harvard Law, some people cruelly nicknamed me ‘Lord Honky the Lardassed,’ and the jar of mayo I kept in my bag was derisively referred to as my ‘bottle of honky fuel,’” said Sen. Ted Cruz in a later part of the presentation, stoically fighting back tears while the entire senate chamber erupted into laughter at how fucking hilarious the phrase “honky fuel” is. Cruz then closed out his speech by asking if any of his Democratic colleagues honestly could look him in the eye and tell him anti-white discrimination didn’t exist when just yesterday #TedCruzHonkyAss had trended on Twitter, which they admittedly couldn’t because they were laughing too hard at the hashtag to speak. Wow, the Republicans have really shot themselves in the foot with this one. Still, even if they’ve failed to prove discrimination against white people actually exists, we’ve got to give them credit for reminding us just how funny calling someone a honky can be."
Taking One For The Team: This Man Was The One Who Had To Go Out And Select The Birthday Card Everyone In The Office Had To Sign,N/A,https://clickhole.com/taking-one-for-the-team-this-man-was-the-one-who-had-to-go-out-and-select-the-birthday-card-everyone-in-the-office-had-to-sign/,"Here’s a story about someone who found it within himself to step up and take one for the team despite knowing he was setting himself up for a truly miserable experience: This man was the one who had to go out and select the birthday card everyone in the office had to sign. What an incredible act of selflessness. Hopefully his coworkers realize what a sacrifice he just made.  Soon after Keith Garvey of Boston, MA arrived at work earlier this morning, he received a Slack message from his boss that was sent to a group of all but one of his coworkers that read, “Today is Shannon’s birthday.” And while one of his coworkers was quick to respond, “Should we get her a card?” and another was quick to say, “Yes,” the long period of time that followed without anyone else responding made it very clear that while everyone agreed they should get her a card, no one wanted to do the terrible chore of having to shlep over to the store and buy one. Finally, though, after what felt like hours but was probably just 15 seconds, Keith courageously took it upon himself to volunteer to buy the card, even though there were several people in the office who were much better friends with Shannon and definitely should’ve taken the lead on this one. While Keith would’ve loved to stay inside and eat his lunch in the kitchen like everyone else, he had to head out to Walgreens, where, because there isn’t a greeting card category for “coworker’s birthday,” he had to search through birthday cards with crude jokes that seemed overly fraternal and cards with big flowers and cursive fonts that seemed weirdly austere. After looking at dozens of cards that seemed like they’d be blank inside but instead said something weird like “To my beautiful loved one,” Keith managed to find a card with some donuts on the front that said “Donut have a bad birthday—have a great one!” on the inside, which was stupid, but ultimately inoffensive enough for the occasion.  Despite the fact that Keith had already done way more than anyone else, it was unfortunately now his duty to make sure everyone in the office signed the card, a task that, while seemingly small, somehow took up, like, two fucking hours. Everyone gave at least a little bit of their time to sign the card, but it was Keith who gave the most—he made the ultimate sacrifice. And although Keith’s boss let him know that he could get reimbursed for buying the card if he completed the necessary paperwork, the fact that the card was only $5.75 made it too cheap to be worth filling out the forms, while also just expensive enough to be kind of annoying. What a good sport. Here’s to you, Keith. You had no idea what this day had in store for you, but you absolutely rose to the occasion. You are a rockstar employee, and here’s hoping your heroic deed earns you a raise. "
"Deeply Troubling: Hackers Just Leaked Subway’s Training Videos Online, Giving Foreign Adversaries Everything They Need To Construct Italian BMTs Of Their Own",N/A,https://clickhole.com/deeply-troubling-hackers-just-leaked-subways-training-videos-online-giving-foreign-adversaries-everything-they-need-to-construct-italian-bmts-of-their-own/,"When cyberterrorists infiltrate company servers and expose highly sensitive data, the implications can be catastrophic, which is something that one major fast food chain is currently learning the hard way: Hackers just leaked Subway’s training videos online, giving foreign adversaries everything they need to construct Italian BMTs of their own. Jesus. It’s terrifying to think of what might happen should this information get into the wrong hands. Earlier today, a group of hackers who operate under the name DeliTruth dumped over 50 hours of Subway training videos onto a dark web forum dedicated to exposing corporate and government secrets, allowing anyone with a WiFi connection to access detailed blueprints for how to construct the foul-tasting sandwiches and deploy them for their own sinister means. Between demonstrating proper bread slicing techniques to revealing how many slices of Genoa salami go on a six-inch, these tutorials provide all the intel necessary for hostile countries to build exact replicas of Subway’s miserable take on a classic Italian sub, which is pretty much the last thing this fractured, unstable world needs right now. The data has already been downloaded thousands of times and shared widely across the internet, meaning it’s too late to do damage control. Unfortunately, all we can do now is sit back and watch as America’s greatest foes seize on the evil potential of these slimy footlong abominations and commit devastating crimes against deliciousness.  “We are working quickly to close the firewall gap in our system that was exploited by hackers, but the alarming truth of the matter is the data is out there, and our nation’s enemies are almost certainly working now to weaponize Italian BMTs on an unprecedented scale,” said Subway in a press release addressing the cyberattack. “These training videos were intended to be used by newly hired sandwich artists as tools for good. But the grim reality is that terrorist groups across the globe are likely now stocking up on Black Forest ham and green peppers to commit unthinkable atrocities, and there is little we can do to stop them.” “At this point, all we can do is pray,” the statement continued. With the secret to Subway’s Italian BMT out in the open, there are endless nefarious ways that authoritarian regimes or terrorist organizations can use these 820-calorie monstrosities, whether force-feeding them to dissidents to get confessions, silencing pro-democracy movements by inflicting their leaders with brutal diarrhea, or even trafficking their own versions of the BMTs on the black market to create large underground fast casual sandwich networks with cash flows rivaling those of legitimate Subway franchises.  This is, to put it lightly, an absolute nightmare scenario. Not to be alarmist, but everyone should be shitting their pants right about now. While it is too late for Subway to put their Italian BMT training videos back under wraps, here’s hoping other companies will see this as a wake-up call to safeguard their own data before it ends up in the wrong hands. For now, we can only expect to see more and more U.S. adversaries going scorched-earth with the Italian BMT."
"‘Find The Key In The Snake Pit To Disable The Bomb’: The Washington Post Is Making Users Solve A Sick, Twisted Puzzle In Order To Get Past Their Paywall",N/A,https://clickhole.com/find-the-key-in-the-snake-pit-to-disable-the-bomb-the-washington-post-is-making-users-solve-a-sick-twisted-puzzle-in-order-to-get-past-their-paywall/,"Paywalls are seemingly ubiquitous these days, and it’s almost a challenge to find a website where you can still read articles for free. However, one website has started offering a new way for readers to access content that doesn’t require them to pony up for yet another subscription: The Washington Post is letting readers get past their paywall as long as they solve a sick, twisted puzzle. Wow! Starting this week, non-subscriber visitors to the Washington Post who have used up their allotment of free articles for the month will no longer be turned away from the website and will instead be greeted by a prompt that reads, “To continue reading, complete a puzzle.” Those who accept the challenge will then be redirected to a pitch black screen with an audio message from a mysterious figure known only as the Puzzle Master, who says, “I can show you the content you crave. But first, do you have what it takes to survive my puzzle?” Upon responding “YES,” a steel seatbelt will then immediately fasten the website visitor to their computer chair, giving them no means of escaping as they’re suddenly plunged into a gauntlet of horrors that they must make it through alive in three minutes or less, otherwise they won’t be able to access the article, even in a private tab. “In order to continue delivering you high quality, groundbreaking journalism, we’re asking you to support the Washington Post by becoming a subscriber or, if you’re unable to contribute financially, proving your strength and will to live by digging through a pit of rattlesnakes to find a key that you can use to unlock a vest of explosives strapped to your chest before it detonates,” reads a new pop-up message on the Post website. “By carefully heeding the instructions of the Puzzle Master (whose identity is unknown to us as well) and successfully solving his sadistic puzzle without dying, readers will gain access to the same award-winning journalism that’s available to paid subscribers.” In a statement announcing the new content access guidelines, the Post revealed that the Puzzle Master’s traps will change with every article so that readers aren’t able to cheat, requiring them each and every visit to navigate an entirely new series of nightmarish obstacles in order to access the content, whether it’s a spiked helmet that becomes tighter and tighter on your head until you figure out the password to unlock it, a system of shackles and pulleys that slowly draw-and-quarter you a little more with each incorrect response, a modified cremation oven that gets hotter and hotter every passing second until you solve a riddle, and a challenging CAPTCHA-like image-matching interface that must be perfectly maneuvered to avoid being submerged in a vertical cylinder of flesh-melting acid.  Damn! This is a seriously bold move from the Washington Post, but one that will undoubtedly be welcomed by anyone who’s tired of paying for subscriptions in order to read the news. Your move, New York Times!"
Mutually Assured Destruction: These White Former Classmates All Still Have The Video Of Their 12-Year-Old Selves Rapping ‘Straight Outta Compton’,N/A,https://clickhole.com/mutually-assured-destruction-these-white-former-classmates-all-still-have-the-video-of-their-12-year-old-selves-rapping-straight-outta-compton/,"Growing up, we all make mistakes that seem harmless at the time but are absolutely mortifying in retrospect. Unfortunately for a group of childhood friends from Cranford, New Jersey, they preserved one of their most regrettable middle school moments on camera—footage that would take them each and every one of them down should it ever see the light of day again: These white former classmates all still have the video of their 12-year-old selves rapping “Straight Outta Compton.” Yikes.  When Daniel Thurston, Eli Silverstein, and Jordan Donnelly filmed their preteen selves rapping the notoriously profane N.W.A. classic at a sleepover back in 2008, little did the caucasian boys know that the finished product would one day have the power to absolutely destroy them all. The compromising footage, recorded on the webcam of Daniel’s basement family computer, features each friend performing Ice Cube, MC Ren, and Eazy-E’s verses, wearing middle school soccer team sweatshirts with the hoods up, flipping off the camera, and casually dropping every N-word used throughout the song. Though a few years later the boys had the foresight to take the footage off of Facebook, where they had publicly posted it the very night it was filmed, Daniel, Eli, and Jordan still have access to the video file via an old email thread between them, guaranteeing that if any of the three had a personal fallout and were to use this social nuke against the others, they’d all be taken down together. While Jordan had once considered deleting the email for good measure—paranoid about the off chance his email account would be hacked and the video of his braces-mouthed, acne-ridden 12-year-old self rapping lyrics such as “I find a good piece of pussy and go up in it” in a blaccent somehow went viral on the Internet—a part of him felt that in the event of Daniel or Eli turning on him and trying to ruin his life for some reason, he should hold onto the video as a deterrent, or, in a worst case scenario, a retaliatory warhead. Unbeknownst to Jordan, both Daniel and Eli—who at one point in the footage is wearing just the Rocawear wife beater he’d begged his mom to buy him and making the Bloods gang sign with his hands—had the exact same thought and refrained from deleting the video as well. Despite the fact that all three remain on good terms and currently have no incentive to launch such a scorched earth attack—one which would unveil mortifying footage of Daniel acting tough by pulling up his shirt and pointing at his abs with an airsoft pistol he’d made look like a real gun by blacking out the orange safety muzzle with a Sharpie—the idea alone that each of them has this doomsday option in their back-pocket is probably enough to deter any of them from making it public at any point in the future. Yep, this is definitely a mutually assured destruction sort of situation. Luckily for Daniel, Eli, and Jordan, it’s hard to imagine any hypothetical circumstances in a friendship dire enough to merit releasing such a brutally embarrassing video to the public. It’d be kamikaze, plain and simple, and just the mere thought of what would happen if it got out should be more than enough to keep these guys in line."
Yay! The CDC Just Caved And Said You Don’t Have To Wash Your Hands On Your Birthday,N/A,https://clickhole.com/yay-the-cdc-just-caved-and-said-you-dont-have-to-wash-your-hands-on-your-birthday/,"It would be an understatement to say that dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic has taken a toll on national morale, but some fantastic news from the federal government may lift spirits just a little bit: The CDC just caved and said you don’t have to wash your hands on your birthday! Yay!!!!! This is so fun! The Center For Disease Control posted an update on their website this week stating that, while hand washing remains an effective way to protect against the spread of COVID, Americans may take a break for 24 hours on their birthdays.  “After a great deal of research, scientists have concluded that you should get to enjoy your special day and not waste it scrubbing your hands, which is no fun,” the update read. “Go ahead, treat yourself! Just one day of having gross hands won’t hurt anyone. Feel free to be a little naughty—it’s not every day that it’s your birthday, after all.” “We know that having to wash your hands for 20 lonnnnng seconds a zillion times a day can be a huge bummer, so have some fun, it’s fine,” the statement continued. “You won’t get in trouble, we promise. Your birthday’s not about COVID—it’s about you!” Awesome! A little bit of germs never hurt anyone.  The CDC went on to say that people should still wear masks in public indoor spaces and practice social distancing on their birthdays, but as far as hand washing goes, the agency is willing to turn a blind eye. What a nice and fun thing for the CDC to do after so many miserable months of pandemic life. Happy birthday to us all!"
A Piece Of History: The Bed In Which JFK Passed Away Peacefully In His Sleep At 93 Surrounded By Friends And Family Is Coming To The Smithsonian ,N/A,https://clickhole.com/a-piece-of-history-the-bed-in-which-jfk-passed-away-peacefully-in-his-sleep-at-93-surrounded-by-friends-and-family-is-coming-to-the-smithsonian/,"Millions of people can still vividly recall where they were when they heard President John F. Kennedy had died, but soon the American public will have the rare opportunity to see exactly where JFK himself was at the moment of his passing: The bed in which JFK passed away peacefully in his sleep at 93 surrounded by friends and family is coming to the Smithsonian.  Wow! What an extraordinary glimpse into history this will be. Next month, the National Museum of American History will display the bed where the 35th President died of natural causes in his sleep on November 22nd, 2010, at his longtime home in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts. Placards around the exhibit will offer visitors an intimate, beat-by-beat breakdown of JFK’s tranquil final hours on that idyllic November evening when his closest friends and family joined him at his bedside, sharing their most cherished memories together. At the conclusion of the exhibit, visitors will be shown never-before-seen footage of those who were with JFK that day describing the waning moments of his life, when his wife Jackie took his hand and he closed his eyes for the final time, with the former president looking peaceful and satisfied after a long and fulfilling life as one of our nation’s greatest public servants.  Among those present at his bedside were his brother Robert, his wife Jackie, their children and grandchildren, and a number of dear friends he’d made throughout life: from childhood, college, his political career, and the 24-year post-political career he led following his two full-terms as President before retiring from public life in order to spend time with his family on their pastoral estate, having accomplished everything he ever dreamed of and more. All those in attendance had the bittersweet opportunity to express to JFK all that he meant to their lives, and how much they loved him, leaving absolutely nothing unsaid before he departed from this world.  Using soundscapes and dynamic lighting, the exhibit will aim to accurately capture the strikingly serene atmosphere at the Hyannis Port estate on that day in 2010, with the soothing sound of leaves rustling and whippoorwills singing in the crisp autumn air just outside Kennedy’s window, and the pale glow of the full moon softly lighting the room just as it was when Kennedy took his last breath. Despite knowing he was close to the end, witnesses say Kennedy was joyful and lucid in his final moments, using his remaining energy to share brief words of gratitude with all who were present, reassuring them that he had lived a full and satisfying life with no regrets.  The most moving feature of the exhibit will almost certainly be the first-ever public showing of the powerful photograph of Jackie at her husband’s bedside in her spotless pink Chanel suit, still looking as strong and glamorous as ever as she gently caressed his face one final time—the perfect goodbye after 57 beautiful years of happiness and love. Those who have seen the photo say that it perfectly captures the storybook ending to the storybook marriage of America’s most beloved couple, leaving one with a profound sense of closure.     Amazing. It sounds like this exhibit will be a truly special tribute to a truly special man.  If you even have a marginal interest in American history, you should absolutely make the trip to Washington D.C. to see this exhibit while you’ve got the chance. What an amazing way to honor the legacy of one of our nation’s greatest and longest-living leaders. "
Medical Miracle: This Man Has Survived 30 Whole Years Outside The Womb,N/A,https://clickhole.com/medical-miracle-this-man-has-survived-30-whole-years-outside-the-womb/,"Sometimes there’s just no explanation for a medical phenomenon other than a miracle, and that appears to be the case with this story about a man who’s overcome impossible odds in a way that simply cannot be explained: This man has survived 30 whole years outside the womb. Amazing!  In defiance of all known laws of medical science, Brendan O’Connell of Boston, Massachusetts has somehow managed to survive over three decades outside the womb, completely exposed to the elements and with no direct access to the nutrients he needs to live. Since the day he was first removed from his mother’s uterus as a nine-month-old fetus, Brendan has been beating the odds: He has managed to not only to survive, but to thrive, growing a full six feet in height and gaining 180 pounds during his extraordinary life.  At the time of his birth, Brendan was tragically separated from the umbilical cord that provided him with precious oxygen, leaving him in a state totally incompatible with life. But it’s clear that God was watching over him, as he has since grown up into a healthy, functional adult and has achieved such unlikely feats as joining a basketball team, attending Florida State University, and maintaining a full-time job. His parents must never have expected such impressive things to come from a boy who, by all logic and reason, shouldn’t have had any hope for survival, but thankfully the universe decided to spare him an awful fate and let him lead a happy, productive life.  Wow! This just goes to show that there’s more to life than science can explain. Brendan’s incredible story proves that there’s no such thing as impossible, and that it’s never foolish to have hope, even in the most hopeless of situations. "
"Cool Off, Guy: A Marine Biologist Visiting For Career Day Just Told All The Kids That Being A Marine Biologist Will ‘Take Everything You’ve Got And Leave You Begging For Mercy’",N/A,https://clickhole.com/cool-off-guy-a-marine-biologist-visiting-for-career-day-just-told-all-the-kids-that-being-a-marine-biologist-will-take-everything-youve-got-and-leave-you-begging-for-mercy/,"It’s good to take pride in what you do, but Christ, this guy could probably stand to dial things back a little: A marine biologist visiting for Career Day just told all the kids that being a marine biologist is brutal enough to make the living envy the dead. Buddy, you look at fish for your job. Relax! About a dozen professionals from a wide range of fields have been giving brief presentations about their work today as part of Groughton Elementary’s annual Career Day, and so far they’ve all been pretty informative and even-handed until this marine biologist got up and told everyone that photographing seahorse courtship rituals can turn even the toughest, baddest sons of bitches in the sciences into a shivering pile of piss and tears overnight. He went on to add that a single day tracking seasonal narwhal migration patterns requires more grit, strength, and tenacity than most people show in an entire lifetime, and that anyone who tries to map the approximate range of narwhal’s wintertime feeding grounds without possessing an unbreakable iron spirit would get chewed up and spit out so bad they’d wish they’d never been born. Not only does it feel kind of untrue to say that stuff like researching the life cycle of horseshoe crabs is going to shatter your body and soul in ways you never imagined possible, it also seems like a pretty weird thing to say to a bunch of eight-year-olds who are still a decade away from being able to even think about actually choosing a profession. This really feels like the kind of thing where you should just show off some cool footage of dolphins or sea turtles, not spout some R. Lee Ermey shit about how cataloguing regional variations in manta ray fin morphology will rip them apart like a mad dog if they display even the slightest hint of weakness. Like, maybe that’s true for the handful of marine biologists studying great white sharks or whatever, but we googled this guy and all we could find his name on were a couple research papers about kelp. Maybe just do a lap around the building and try this again when you’ve calmed down, pal. “If you don’t have what it takes to hack it out there exploring the relationship between parrotfish and the sedimentary properties of their biomes, you can always tuck your tail between your legs and go crawling back to this guy for a job,” said the marine biologist just now, derisively jerking his thumb towards the wilderness paramedic who had spoken before him. “Once you actually get a good look at what it’s like to measure the calcium content of scallop shell samples, you’ll be crying out for mama, but guess what? Mama ain’t coming. It’s just you and the shells.” This guy’s clearly gone well over his five minute suggested time limit by now, but unfortunately he’s on way too much of a roll about how wrasse identification will utterly annihilate all who attempt it with imperfect courage for this to end anytime soon. Man, we really can’t condone getting this riled up over marine biology. We’d feel bad if this winds up putting these kids off the subject entirely, but honestly that might be for the best if it keeps them from ending up like this dude."
Is That Even Allowed? This Wizard Has A Pistol,N/A,https://clickhole.com/is-that-even-allowed-this-wizard-has-a-pistol/,"Hmm, something isn’t right here. Nope, we don’t like this one bit. There’s a scene currently going down in a public park in Hartford, CT that is both incredibly disturbing and probably illegal: This wizard has a pistol. Yeah, this definitely feels wrong. Pretty sure you can’t do that. For several hours now, the wizard has been waving his gun around and making “pew pew pew!” sounds, brazenly defying society’s widely agreed-upon understanding of wizards as spooky, bearded grandpas armed only with small wooden wands that are used for shooting magic spells and turning various objects into frogs. Never do guns factor into archetypical depictions of wizards, presumably because it’d look weird and unnatural for them to pack heat, as is clearly evidenced by this magical oddball here, whose gun-toting demeanor feels so jarring and wrong that you’d assume it must be in violation of some unspoken rule or warlock oath.   To begin with, wizards already have a major advantage over regular people because their knowledge of spells and other forms of devilry allows them to do pretty much whatever they want all the time—and certainly having a gun tips the scales even more in their favor.  Plus, they basically already have control over life and death, so the fact that this wizard is just out and about holding both a wand and a pistol is beyond unfair, as no guy should have that much power. Even if it’s legal, it absolutely shouldn’t be.  Now, it’d be one thing if the wizard was just going to use his pistol as a wand to shoot spells. It’d be a bit quirky for sure, but ultimately not a big deal. But this wizard has a gun AND a wand, giving him a huge edge over not only regular people but also his fellow sorcerers. It’s clearly cheating. And, if you factor in the likelihood that the wizard could very easily put a spell on the bullets and supercharge them so that they can travel for hundreds of miles or turn into bombs or something, there’s really no limit on the destruction he’s capable of. Besides, none of the famous wizards from popular culture that we know and love have ever had a gun. Harry Potter never had a gun. Gandalf never had a gun. So not sure where this guy got the idea that it’s okay for him to have one. He should know better. Even evil wizards don’t have guns. So where does he think he gets off? Again, this must be in violation of some warlock oath.   Someone should look into this. Just doesn’t seem right.  Here’s hoping he comes to his senses and gets rid of the gun, or, if not that, the police come and take him to jail. Not saying we’re experts on this stuff, but it seems pretty obvious that wizards shouldn’t be allowed to have guns. That’s no fun for anyone. What’s fun is playing by the rules, and this wizard needs to start doing that, STAT."
Oh My God: Dad Just Let It Slip That He Thinks Of Himself As Stoic,N/A,https://clickhole.com/oh-my-god-dad-just-let-it-slip-that-he-thinks-of-himself-as-stoic/,"Look, it’s no secret that self-awareness isn’t exactly Dad’s strong suit, but the old man just casually mentioned something that suggests his perception of himself is even more out of whack than previously believed: Dad just let it slip that he thinks of himself as stoic.  LMAO, what?!? Sorry, Pops, but that assessment is WILDLY off the mark.  Dad revealed this incredibly inaccurate opinion of himself earlier today in response to a story Mom was telling about how a couple they know is experiencing marital difficulties partly due to the husband’s emotional inaccessibility, to which he replied with a completely straight face that, “I mean, the fact is that men of our generation are just stoic by nature. I don’t let my feelings show, either.” It was a truly bewildering statement to hear from a man who literally throws a tantrum every time he’s forced to use self-checkout at a store, and who once refused to eat dinner one night because Mom didn’t buy his preferred brand of mustard to have with bratwurst, and who just this week has been whining nonstop every day about how the shade from the neighbors’ new gazebo is causing the grass along the property line in our yard to yellow. Empirically and indisputably, Dad is an overly sensitive, immature little bitch, and it is utterly baffling how he somehow arrived at this idea of himself as an emotionally steady, rock-of-the-family type. Perhaps all the WWII movies he watches have rubbed off on him and made him feel like he’s some kind of solemn “man of few words” who quietly sips scotch at night to deal with his demons, but it’d take some next-level mental gymnastics to reconcile this notion with his actual, real-life behavior, which is so driven by stress and rage that he literally has to take prescription medication every day for his blood pressure. Like, have you ever seen this guy try to maintain his composure when ordering at a drive-thru? Dude’s an absolute mess. He is basically just an overweight, sentient mass of emotional volatility that at any moment could erupt at the slightest provocation.   Seriously, how could he possibly see himself as stoic? What’s going on in his little pig brain that made him arrive at such a batshit conclusion? But, hey, whatever. If Dad wants to portray himself as stoic despite the fact that he once punched a hole in the living room drywall because the Bears shanked a game-winning field goal attempt, he can go ahead. Not like anyone listens to him anyway. Fuckin’ doofus."
Stolen Valor: This Man Is Wearing A Toupee Despite Having Floor-Length Golden Hair,N/A,https://clickhole.com/stolen-valor-this-man-is-wearing-a-toupee-despite-having-floor-length-golden-hair/,"There’s nothing more disgusting than falsely exploiting the bravery of others to enhance your own public image, and this son of a bitch might be the worst case we’ve ever seen: This man is wearing a toupee despite having floor-length golden hair. Oh, hell no. Not just anyone can wear a toupee—you gotta earn that shit, motherfucker.  In a just world, toupees would only be worn by those who have actually undergone the harrowing ordeal of male-pattern baldness, but absolute piece of shit Silas Blanchard has co-opted the toupee for his own reputational gain even though he still possesses a robust mane of lush, flaxen hair. This imposter has no idea what it’s like to awkwardly crane your neck up at a hand mirror angled at a bathroom mirror to examine a widening bald spot, and while he probably thinks he looks like hot shit strutting around in that awesome, stately toupee, he wouldn’t last one goddamn day out in the real world if he was actually suffering from hair loss. Some men spend years, even decades, rubbing medicinal salves onto their scalps and sleeping in weird, non-FDA approved electrode caps, but this Rapunzel-looking shitheel thinks he can just skip all that and cut straight to the perks of toupee ownership as if it’s merely a fashion choice and not an entire way of life. Part of what makes this so galling is how easily you can see through his attempts to pass himself off as an authentic toupee-wearer if you know what to look for: He no doubt thinks it looks convincing how he reflexively claps a hand over his toupee whenever a strong breeze comes up, but the radiant flowing locks billowing luxuriously out behind him should instantly set off alarm bells that this guy’s not what he seems. He also frequently asks total strangers if they’ve noticed that he’s wearing a toupee, when a real balding guy would never draw attention to their toupee so tactlessly, preferring instead to simply wear it in quiet dignity. Perhaps the most infuriating display we’ve seen came after seagull snatched his toupee during a trip to the beach, when he made a big show of chasing after it and shouting, “My toupee! My toupee! I can’t live without my toupee!” despite looking straight out of a Pantene commercial with his naturally gorgeous tresses glimmering in the sunlight. Fucking hell, is nothing sacred? We’d really like to get up in this fraud’s face and confront him over his sickening, cowardly little masquerade. He may think he can walk the walk in that toupee, but subjecting him to a little direct questioning like “Who was your practicing hair loss specialist, sir?” and “What hair transplant center were you treated at?” would expose him as the phony long-haired charlatan that he is. Of course there’s nothing inherently wrong with having a full head of splendid, lustrous hair so long it can tickle your ankles, but trying to appropriate the toupee when you don’t have the partially exposed scalp to back it up is deception at its most bastardly.  Seriously—this is a bridge too fucking far. What an utterly contemptible lie this double-dealing asshole is living. Here’s hoping he’ll come to his senses and hang up that toupee for good, or the toupee-respecting people of this country might have to take matters into our own hands. Better watch your back, fucko. "
"Just The Once Was Fine, Ozzy: Ozzy Osbourne Has Been Unsuccessfully Attempting To Bite The Head Off A Toyota Corolla Car Seat On Instagram Live For The Last Six Hours",N/A,https://clickhole.com/just-the-once-was-fine-ozzy-ozzy-osbourne-has-been-unsuccessfully-attempting-to-bite-the-head-off-a-toyota-corolla-car-seat-on-instagram-live-for-the-last-six-hours/,"Ozzy Osbourne is unquestionably one of the greatest frontmen in rock history, but unfortunately the 72-year-old singer is currently in the middle of something that may very well sully his incredible legacy: Ozzy has been unsuccessfully trying to bite the head off a Toyota Corolla car seat on Instagram Live for the last six hours. Damn. Yeah, definitely didn’t have to run this one back, Ozzy. Just doing it the one time with the bat was fine. Any self-respecting rock fan can tell you how iconic it was when Ozzy bit the head off a live bat during a concert back in 1982, but unfortunately, the Black Sabbath singer seems intent on tainting that legendary moment with the underwhelming sequel that’s currently unfolding. Taking to Instagram Live just past five o’clock this morning, standing in his driveway and clearly trying to look concert-ready—leather duster, big cross necklace, but also a few depressing additions like ratty pajama pants and those grippy kinds of socks they give out in hospitals—the metal icon greeted his 4.5 million followers with a spirited, “Hello, Instagram! Who wants to see me bite off something even bigger and cooler than a bat’s head?” From there, he crawled into the backseat of a 1998 Toyota Corolla, fumbled with the radio’s Bluetooth settings until “Mr. Crowley” came blasting through the speakers, clicked his phone into one of those windshield holders that old people and Uber drivers like to use, and began futilely trying to bite the headrest off the driver’s seat. From the jump, it was clear that Ozzy did not understand the impossibility of what he had set out to do. After throwing up devil horns to the camera, Ozzy put the front seat in a headlock like it was gonna try to run away, dramatically lowered his teeth toward it like a vampire, and began just kind of gnawing and slurping on the headrest for a while. To see the rock legend futilely slobbering all over a car seat for hours on end has been a pretty big bummer, and sadly he’s still going at it despite getting no closer to his goal of biting off the headrest than when he started. Soaked in sweat and gasping for air with his eyeliner dripping down his face, you gotta imagine that this isn’t what he envisioned when he kicked off the stunt.  Oof. Yeah, if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it, Ozzy. No need to relive the glory days.  Unfortunately, things are only getting more and more depressing, as he is now pausing every few minutes to share little anecdotes with the “crowd” like how singers do at real concerts, including one about how arthritis has warped his fingers so badly that he can no longer take his rings off, and another about how he still talks to Randy Rhoads in his dreams. Then there’s the fact that the “This is Ozzy Osbourne” Spotify playlist he had going ended hours ago, so Spotify did that thing where it starts playing similar-ish songs, but six hours in it’s totally grasping at straws and playing super non-Ozzy stuff like Genesis and The Jackson 5. Meanwhile, the vast majority of comments he’s receiving from viewers are expressing concern, saying things like, “Are you okay, Ozzy? Need us to call someone to help you?” and “Hey man, you should prob see a doctor who specializes in dementia, we’re worried for you.” However, Ozzy remains unfazed and has yet to show any signs of slowing down.  Yeesh. It’s tough to watch one of metal’s greatest showmen miss the mark this badly, and for six straight hours and counting. Here’s hoping Ozzy manages to at least bite off a small chunk of the headrest so he can feel like he got a victory, or that his phone dies soon, or that a family member realizes he’s missing and comes to take him back to his room or something. We’re pulling for you, Ozzy! "
Demystifying Mental Illness: Scientists Have Determined That You May Be At A High Risk For Depression If Your Life Sucks,N/A,https://clickhole.com/demystifying-mental-illness-scientists-have-determined-that-you-may-be-at-a-high-risk-for-depression-if-your-life-sucks/,"Mental health conditions can be caused or exacerbated by a number of factors, whether genetic, biological, environmental, or social. But one group of researchers recently completed a landmark study pinpointing one of the primary catalysts for a common, debilitating mental condition: Scientists have determined that you may be at a high risk for depression if your life sucks. Wow! This is a truly groundbreaking discovery.  A team of clinical researchers at Harvard University recently completed a 10-year longitudinal study whose findings indicate that a given individual is much more likely to suffer from the hopelessness, lethargy, and frequent mood swings associated with major depression if their life sucks complete and utter ass. The team arrived at this conclusion following an ambitious, multi-year study observing the behaviors of individuals divided into two different test groups. Individuals in the first test group, or the “Awesome Life Cohort,” were provided with swanky high-rise apartments, meaningful, fulfilling jobs in their chosen fields, a large circle of devoted friends and lovers, and unlimited money. Conversely, individuals in the second test group, or the “Shitty Life Cohort,”  were forced to live in filthy, dilapidated basement apartments and spend 12 hours a day working in solitary, dead-end temp jobs, all while regularly being reminded that their peers and family members thought of them as huge losers. The results were astonishing: After just one year, members of the Shitty Life Cohort were 10 times more likely than the Awesome Life Cohort to report thoughts such as “I feel sad that I live in a nasty rat hole,” and “The fact that I do the exact same boring activities every day of my life with zero acknowledgment or positive reinforcement from my family or peers makes me unhappy.” Whereas members of the Awesome Life Cohort were exponentially more likely to report thoughts such as “I feel fantastic all the time” and “I have no complaints about my life because everything is perfect.” “The bottom line is, the longer you endure what the average American would consider an absolute trash dump of an existence, the more likely you are to suffer from depression—and conversely, leading an epic life of luxury where the adventures never stop is protective against the low moods associated with depression,” explained lead researcher Dr. Timothy McDougall. “There are clear short-term implications of having a shitty life as well: in another experiment, we found that members of a group who we punched in the stomach were highly likely to frown or cry as a result (two common depression indicators), while members of a second group to whom we gave $50 Starbucks gift cards were much more inclined to smile and even hum a happy tune. The evidence clearly suggests a higher probability of debilitating mental health disorders for those whose lives are total ass and full of misery and woe.” McDougall and his research team said that their study has profound implications for the treatment of depression. Future therapies could include taking a whirlwind, all-expenses-paid trip to the hottest tourist destinations around the globe, receiving 10 million dollars, or even winning the love and admiration of people around the world via a project that is both personally fulfilling and incredibly altruistic. How fascinating! We truly have so much to learn about psychology and the human brain, and these amazing new insights will undoubtedly have impacts on the field for years to come. Kudos to these extraordinary scientists for doing such important work to demystify an illness that affects so many millions of people every day. "
Brothers In Crisis: Dylan And Cole Sprouse Got Too Drunk Last Night And Now They Don’t Know Which One Is Which,N/A,https://clickhole.com/brothers-in-crisis-dylan-and-cole-sprouse-got-too-drunk-last-night-and-now-they-dont-know-which-one-is-which/,"Nothing good ever comes from a long night of drinking, and two of Hollywood’s most famous brothers unfortunately just learned this the hard way: Dylan and Cole Sprouse got too drunk last night and now they don’t know which one is which. Ugh, what a headache. This is the last thing you want to deal with when hungover.  According to sources familiar with the situation, after going on a liquor-fueled bender last night to celebrate being brothers, Dylan and Cole both awoke in a hazy stupor this morning with absolutely zero idea which specific twin they were. While taking turns vomiting into a small garbage bin, the two began frantically comparing license photos and calling one another “Dylan” and “Cole” to see if one name resonated with them more than the other. All of this was to no avail, as the sleep-deprived, nausea-ridden brothers only grew less and less sure of their true identities with each attempt to clarify who was Dylan and who was Cole. “I am…Dylan…no, wait…I am…Cole…,” muttered both brothers simultaneously as they stared into the mirror and pointed at one another in utter confusion. “Which brother is which…he does not know….”   Panicked, the brothers tried a number of strategies to get to the bottom of their identity crisis, including running reverse image searches of themselves on Google and asking their parents over FaceTime, but neither technology nor kin could discern one identical sibling from the other. Out of ideas for telling each other apart, the brothers ultimately just gave up on trying and instead opted to write “Dylan” and “Cole” on two slips of paper and then draw them from a hat to determine which name each would go with for the rest of their lives.  God, how frustrating. Poor guys. Our hearts go out to the Sprouse twins today. Hopefully Dylan and Cole can move past this fiasco and learn to feel confident in the identities they drew from the hat. Good luck, Dylan and Cole!"
Clearing Things Up: Paul Simon Has Revealed The Crime He Sings About In ‘Me And Julio Down By The Schoolyard’ Is Huffing Nitrous In A Two-Person Superman Costume,N/A,https://clickhole.com/clearing-things-up-paul-simon-has-revealed-the-crime-he-sings-about-in-me-and-julio-down-by-the-schoolyard-is-huffing-nitrous-in-a-two-person-superman-costume/,"For decades, music fans have wondered what exactly the unnamed crime Paul Simon mentions committing in his 1972 smash hit “Me And Julio Down By The Schoolyard,” and it looks like we’ve finally got an answer: The singer has revealed that the crime he’s referring to is huffing nitrous in a two-person Superman costume. Ah, okay. Thanks for clearing that up, Paul! In a press conference earlier today, Paul Simon announced that the infamous crime “the Mama saw” was simply him and his friend Julio doing whippits in a school parking lot while crammed into a two-person Superman costume—a criminal offense he deemed sufficiently compelling to feature as the centerpiece of one of the most beloved songs he’s released throughout his storied 66-year career. Paul went on to explain that the illegal part of that situation was the nitrous—which felt doubly illegal due to its proximity to a school—and that the Superman costume wasn’t illegal per se, but there was certainly something unsavory to it.  “Although these details aren’t in the song, I’ve always imagined that me and Julio were standing in our costume right on top of one of those merry-go-round things, standing completely still, just passing the nitrous back and forth, totally silent,” said Paul. “We thought that if we did enough nitrous we’d start to believe we actually were Superman, and I’m pleased to report that we were successful in our efforts, having acquired the forbidden knowledge of how it feels to be Superman standing completely still on a merry-go-round.” Paul then clarified that a two-person Superman costume is not like a two-person horse costume, where one person is the front and one is the back, but rather something where you and your friend stand snugly together like dominoes inside a single suit so that it’s nearly bursting at the seams, making the two of you look really thick and therefore really strong—just like the real Superman.” “Fake muscles just aren’t convincing. If you want to look convincingly like Superman, you’ve gotta double up in a single suit with a buddy, and you’ve gotta both flex as hard as you can at all times so that people can tell it’s real human bulk in there and not just padding,” said Simon during a long-winded, 20-minute explanation of the costume. “We got quite good at operating the costume in tandem. Both of our heads were sticking out the neck hole, but we were maneuvering as if a single organism, and this turned out to be an unsettling sight to behold for many of the parents at the playground—two grown men functioning in perfect synchronicity as Superman, standing double-wide in a single suit to convey accurate muscle mass, while passing a can of nitrous back and forth and grinning wide-eyed atop a merry-go-round. No surprise me and Julio would get the cops called on us for that.” Paul continued to say that the reason the radical priest came to get him released was because it was actually the priest’s two-person Superman suit, and he needed it back so he and another priest could sing worship songs in it to trick kids into loving God. All of this, he added, was explained in the original version of the song, but Columbia Records cut it from the version that was eventually released to the public without his knowledge or permission.  What an exciting look into the backstory of such an iconic song! Kudos to Paul for finally shedding light on this mystery, and also for explaining two-person Superman costumes in such thorough detail."

Bold Marketing Strategy: Converse Just Released An Ad Claiming That If That Guy Had Thrown A Converse Shoe At George W. Bush It Would Have Killed Him,N/A,https://clickhole.com/bold-marketing-strategy-converse-just-released-an-ad-claiming-that-if-that-guy-had-thrown-a-converse-shoe-at-george-w-bush-it-would-have-killed-him/,"It’s essential for companies to distinguish themselves from their competitors, and here’s a story about one footwear brand making a bold move to stand out from the pack: Converse just released an ad claiming that if that guy had thrown a Converse shoe at George W. Bush it would have killed him. Whoa. Converse is not messing around! The company announced the new campaign in a press release earlier this week, boasting about how not only do Converse sneakers have an iconic and timeless appeal, but they can also be effectively used to take out any heads of state whose foreign policy you despise. A new commercial spot for the brand opens on black-and-white footage of the infamous 2008 incident in which an Iraqi journalist angrily threw two shoes at then-president Bush, with voiceover that says, “Other footwear brands just don’t get it done.” We then cut to a convincingly edited reimagining of the same footage where the journalist throws a Converse Chuck Taylor sneaker at Bush, which hits him squarely in the chest and causes him to explode. As blood and viscera rain down over the podium, the voiceover returns and says, “Converses would’ve finished him off” before the commercial fades to black.   Damn. Pretty gutsy, Converse.  The campaign also features a print ad showing a large Converse sneaker printed over the image of President Bush ducking away from the shoes that the Iraqi threw at him. The text reads, “A journalist threw both of his shoes at President Bush. He missed both times.” Then, below, larger text reads, “One Converse would’ve gotten it done.” Another print ad takes a more minimalist approach and features a stylish photo of Converse’s fall line with the text, “Comfortable sole. Classic colors. Can destroy the leader of the free world at a Baghdad press conference.”  Wow. Converse is really swinging for the fences with this new campaign, but it’s still unclear whether it will pay off for them. If it does, then it’ll only be a matter of time before major brands like Nike and Adidas follow suit with similar claims of their own."
Spreading Awareness: Benicio Del Toro Just Created A New Foundation To Educate The Ladies That There Is Only So Much Benicio To Go Around,N/A,https://clickhole.com/spreading-awareness-benicio-del-toro-just-created-a-new-foundation-to-educate-the-ladies-that-there-is-only-so-much-benicio-to-go-around/,"It’s always heartwarming to see celebrities use their influence for philanthropic purposes, and here’s a story about one A-list actor going above and beyond to raise awareness for an under-supported cause: Benicio del Toro has created a new foundation to educate the ladies that there is only so much Benicio to go around. Awesome! Now THIS is how you use your platform for good. Earlier today, the Sicario star announced the launch of a new non-profit called the One At A Time, Please foundation, which aims to educate women around the world about how there is simply not enough time in the day for Benicio to share his love with all of them, no matter how much he wishes he could please each and every lady on God’s green earth. The organization is funded entirely by del Toro himself, who’s using his fortune to jump-start community initiatives that give women the knowledge and resources they need to understand that they must not be greedy with Benicio’s love and that he must be shared, as well as to teach them healthy strategies for biding their time while waiting their turn for Benicio’s kiss.  “Ladies, you must understand, Benicio can only make so much love on a given night,” said del Toro in a press release announcing the new foundation. “My loins burn for you just as yours burn for me, yet I am only one man, with only one cock, and there are limits to my lovemaking. I have created this foundation to inform all the beautiful, sexy ladies of this world that Benicio cannot have intimacy with all of them at all times, and that they must not be jealous or heartbroken when he brings other women to his bed, for they have waited for his love. Be patient, my darlings, and know that Benicio has more than enough love for everyone. But you must wait.” “Someday, your time will come,” he continued. “And when it does, Benicio will love you wildly and wholly, with fierceness and tenderness beyond your dreams, and when you feel the pleasures of my lovemaking, you will forget having ever waited to know my bed. I am Benicio, and this is my vow: One day, you shall know me in my nakedness, and you shall cry out with the passion of 1,000 suns once you feel my touch.”   Wow. What an incredibly generous soul! The rest of Hollywood should take note, because this is an amazing example of how to use your fame and fortune to make the world a better place. Ladies, you have truly found an ally in Benicio del Toro!"
"‘Power To Ya, But Damn’: Diet Coke Just Launched A New Ad Campaign About How Not Even They’re Sure Why Some People Start Drinking That Shit At 9 AM",N/A,https://clickhole.com/power-to-ya-but-damn-diet-coke-just-launched-a-new-ad-campaign-about-how-not-even-theyre-sure-why-some-people-start-drinking-that-shit-at-9-am/,"It’s no secret that Americans love soda, but their devotion to certain beverages appears to be more intense than one major soft drink company can even comprehend: Diet Coke just launched a new ad campaign about how not even they’re sure why some people start drinking that shit at 9 a.m. Very bold to call out consumers like this, but you have to appreciate the honesty. The company released a series of print ads, billboards, and commercial spots this week questioning why so many Americans choose to guzzle massive quantities of Diet Coke first thing in the morning, adding that while they certainly appreciate customers’ loyalty to the product, they quite frankly cannot fathom the appeal of throwing back liter after liter of carbonated aspartame syrup when the sun hasn’t even fully risen. “We’ve heard countless stories over the years of people who faithfully start their mornings with humongous gas station cups of Diet Coke or a six-pack of Diet Coke with their breakfast, which is fine if that’s what you’re into, but we’re just not totally sure what makes people think that it’s the sort of thing they should be sucking down straight out of bed,” said the company in a press release. “Like, it’s pretty full of chemicals, you know. Everyone’s free to drink whatever they’d like in the morning, including staggering amounts of Diet Coke, but we’re just making sure you guys know that it’s a soda and not, like, a juice or something.”  One of the campaign’s TV spots shows an elderly couple digging into a pancake breakfast at a diner before flagging their waiter down for two Diet Cokes. A befuddled voiceover is heard saying, “Start your day with Diet Coke, we guess? Sounds gross, to be honest, but you do you.” Then, a print ad from the campaign depicts a man in a bathrobe groggily grabbing a couple cans of Diet Coke from the fridge first thing in the morning, with a caption that reads, “Really? Soda before breakfast? This is what your body’s telling you to do? Pretty weird, but okay.”   It’s definitely a bold marketing strategy, but you’ve gotta appreciate Diet Coke for being so transparent with their customers. Indeed, drinking Diet Coke first thing in the morning seems pretty fucked up, but to each their own. Are YOU someone who drinks Diet Coke right after waking up? If so, let us know why in the comments!"
Getting Back To What Matters: Mark Zuckerberg Is Stepping Down From Facebook To Refocus On His Passion For Helping Harvard Students Connect Online,N/A,https://clickhole.com/getting-back-to-what-matters-mark-zuckerberg-is-stepping-down-from-facebook-to-refocus-on-his-passion-for-helping-harvard-students-connect-online/,"As you build a career, the constant allure of money and status can make it easy to lose sight of the reasons you entered the line of work in the first place. It’s a dangerous trap, and one tech CEO appears to be taking drastic action to avoid falling into it: Mark Zuckerberg is stepping down from Facebook to refocus on his passion for helping Harvard students connect online.  Wow! What an admirable move from one of the most powerful businessmen on the planet.  In a press release that sent shockwaves throughout Silicon Valley earlier today, Zuckerberg announced that he is resigning from his post as Facebook, Inc.’s Chief Executive Officer in order to pursue his company’s initial core mission of building a platform to help Harvard students get to know each other through the internet. Taking several of Facebook’s top engineers and billions of dollars in equity with him, Zuckerberg is aiming to use his vast resources to engineer a Harvard-centric web directory to make it easier for students to navigate the awkward social dynamics of university life and form friendships with like-minded individuals.  “Building Facebook into one of the most successful companies in the world has been an incredible experience, but it’s time for me to refocus on what matters most to me, which is a digital student directory for Harvard undergrads—called HarvardMeet.com or something along those lines—to help them learn each other’s birthdays, hometowns, and favorite TV shows,” said Zuckerberg in a statement announcing his resignation. “In retrospect, letting people who weren’t Harvard students sign up for Facebook was a terrible mistake. It was a decision based on greed and hollow ambition, and it ultimately caused me to lose sight of why I originally started this platform. Now, I’m ready to center my energy and resources on developing an online portal where students at my alma mater can create personal profiles, upload photos, and rank one another by attractiveness.” “Having billions of dollars is admittedly nice, but no amount of money can buy the peace of mind that comes with providing Harvard students with a digital hub to congregate and share memes that are relevant to the campus community,” he continued. Wow. Good for you, Mark! It couldn’t have been easy for Zuckerberg to step away from one of the richest companies in history to follow his convictions, and you have to respect him for taking such a bold leap. And while restarting from scratch certainly won’t be a cakewalk, it’ll undoubtedly be worth it. Best of luck, Mark!"
Yes! Aveeno Has Released A New Line Of Moisturizers Specifically For The 7 Different Types Of Skin That Make Up Your Genitals,N/A,https://clickhole.com/yes-aveeno-has-released-a-new-line-of-moisturizers-specifically-for-the-7-different-types-of-skin-that-make-up-your-genitals/,"In recent years, the skincare market has been growing at breakneck speeds as Americans have become increasingly concerned with self-care, wellness routines, and leading healthier lifestyles. While some brands have struggled to keep up with demand for specialized products that meet specific needs, one beauty company appears more than ready to usher consumers into a new generation of skincare: Aveeno has released a line of moisturizers specifically for the seven different types of skin that your genitals consist of. Awesome! It’s about time someone developed specific treatments for the bewildering hodge-podge of skin types that are found in the groin area.  Earlier this week, Aveeno unveiled its new Down There line of products, with seven unique lotions designed to replenish and restore the fleshy pandemonium that is the human crotch, providing targeted treatment for the chaotic clusterfuck of skin textures that exist in and around the groin. Though a person’s skin is technically considered one single organ, Aveeno is betting big on consumers realizing that the lotion one uses for, say, the normal-looking skin on their torsos is not sufficient for addressing the myriad needs of the bafflingly piecemeal flesh that makes up one’s genitals, whether it’s the smooth, reddish skin of the penis tip, the wacky dermal topography of the vagina, or the shriveled, leathery quagmire that is the scrotum. The new moisturizer varieties are each marketed according to the type of skin they’re meant to treat, with names such as Veins & Wrinkles, Has Very Fine Hairs On It, Inexplicably Paler Than The Rest Of Your Skin, Long-Lasting Labia Defense, Chafe Zone, Sensitive Shaft, and Bumpy & Stretchy. “After years of researching genital skin and all its anomalies—like, how flesh that’s only a few centimeters apart can be entirely different colors, or go from being totally smooth to being riddled with tiny bumps, or how some parts of the skin looks like it belongs on a 95-year-old while other parts look like it could be on a baby—Aveeno has developed the first-ever moisturizing regimen designed specifically for the utter pandemonium of one’s nether regions,” said the company in a statement. “Until now, consumers have had no choice but to use standard body moisturizers to renourish the cushiony flesh directly above the penis or vagina, or the very edge of their thighs right next to the pubes that still grow pubes for some reason, but not anymore. The Aveeno Down There line has a moisturizer for every type of groin skin, whether the translucent-when-stretched skin of the scrotum, the rubbery little ring of flesh that separates the shaft from the penis, or any other kind of skin you might encounter below the waist.” “Simply put, if you point to anywhere on or around the genitals—whether it’s bits of skin that look like they fell off and got chewed up by a dog before getting poorly glued back on, testicle skin that got a little nicked up because you’re still shaving with the same $20 electric trimmer you bought in high school, or literally anything in the vicinity of the vagina lips—Aveeno has you covered,” the statement continued.  So cool! These new lotions are sure to be a total game-changer for anyone who’s either been putting standard body lotion on their junk every now and then when it feels kind of dry or has basically just been ignoring their groin skincare-wise this whole time, and it’s only a matter of time before other skincare brands start releasing genital skin moisturizers of their own. Well done, Aveeno!"
Mental Health Win! Instagram Is Adding A New ‘CONFIDENCE BOOST’ Tab Where You Can Look At Posts From People Whose Lives Are Even Shittier Than Yours,N/A,https://clickhole.com/mental-health-win-instagram-is-adding-a-new-confidence-boost-tab-where-you-can-look-at-posts-from-people-whose-lives-are-even-shittier-than-yours/,"Psychologists and sociologists have long warned that social media takes a toll on users’ mental health, which is why we’re so glad to see this awesome story about a social media company that’s doing something to make their platform a more uplifting space: Instagram is adding a new “CONFIDENCE BOOST” tab where you can look at posts from people whose lives are even shittier than yours. This is so awesome! This month, Instagram will roll out the new CONFIDENCE BOOST feature, which will allow users with low self-esteem to immediately feel better about themselves by showing them posts from people whose lives are much worse than their own, whether they’re uglier or poorer or just generally more unremarkable as a human being. “Most users’ Instagram feeds are full of images of friends and influencers with perfect bodies, gorgeous houses, and happy families, and being bombarded with these images of ‘perfection’ can make a person’s self-worth dip,” said Instagram in a press release explaining the decision. “Our new feature will combat this effect. If you’re feeling low after looking at a supermodel’s post from a lavish yacht party in Mykonos, just navigate to the new CONFIDENCE BOOST tab, where our state-of-the-art curation algorithm will quickly populate a blurry photo of poorly painted toes in dirty Old Navy flip flops posted by a frumpy middle-aged lady on vacation in Myrtle Beach, whose ghostly pale legs and grammatically insane captions will leave you feeling smarter and prettier. Whenever you’re feeling bad about yourself, the CONFIDENCE BOOST feature is there to remind you that, hey, things can always be worse.” Now that’s a mental health win! The sophisticated new technology will work endlessly to generate a constant stream of shitty posts from depressing accounts all over Instagram, ensuring that no matter how many picturesque mountaintop engagement photos and infuriatingly expensive apartment renovation pictures you see on your regular feed, you will be able to keep things in perspective with photos of unshowered women in slapped-together outfits, selfies from mind-numbing Greyhound rides through Indiana, and videos of exhausted-looking stay-at-home moms unenthusiastically hawking LuLaRoe leggings to other exhausted-looking stay-at-home moms.  Instagram worked with psychologists and mental health specialists to develop the feature, which is designed to assist users at their moments of greatest need. For example, after someone has spent more than 20 minutes combing through a famous actress’s photos from her time shooting a film in New Zealand, a message reading “Feeling poor and ugly? Time for a CONFIDENCE BOOST” will flash to help them navigate to a carousel of images cataloguing some poor sap’s time in the ER with a hernia. Wow. This feature sounds like it could be a major game-changer for people who feel stuck trying to keep up with the Joneses on Instagram. Social media may contribute to mental illness, but it doesn’t have to, thanks to awesome companies like Instagram. We are so ready to try this out!"

Seventy-three-year-old Stephen King of Lovell, Maine began his reign of terror in the early 1970s, when, for whatever perverse reason, he began writing dozens upon dozens of creepy-as-fuck horror stories that have since left millions of innocent Americans paralyzed with fear. It’s unclear where King developed his terroristic, antisocial tendencies, but there seems to be nothing he loves more than sitting down to weave tales about the scariest ghosts and plagues and haunted houses he can think of, and then having these sick stories published and disseminated to the unsuspecting American public. He clearly gets a depraved thrill out of knowing that people are lying sleepless in their beds, afraid to close their eyes after reading about the freaky clown he wrote 1,000 pages about in the 1980s, yet as contemptible as his attacks on the American psyche may be, no one has ever done a thing to stop him. So disturbing! Even worse, King is shockingly prolific: There appears to be no end to his desire to come up with straight up horrifying novels about fucked up shit that happens in Maine, as he’s been regularly pushing his nightmare fodder onto Americans for over 50 years now, sometimes even adapting his twisted narratives into films and TV shows to frighten larger audiences. There is clearly something wrong with anyone who dedicates their life to making things that are explicitly designed to inflict maximum terror on the general public, yet the frustrating reality is that what King does is entirely legal under U.S. law, and unfortunately there’s little that can be done to thwart his wicked efforts.   Chilling. This guy may very well be the devil incarnate.  It is deeply upsetting that King has been able to get away with harassing so many millions of people over the decades with his spine-tingling tales, but just because he hasn’t faced consequences doesn’t change the fact that it is NEVER okay to freak people out on purpose. Here’s hoping that this spooky asshole one day realizes this and finally puts an end to his campaign of fear.  "
Living It Up On The Taxpayers’ Dime: Joe Biden Has Already Spent 28 Days Of His Presidency Getting Colonoscopies,N/A,https://clickhole.com/living-it-up-on-the-taxpayers-dime-joe-biden-has-already-spent-28-days-of-his-presidency-getting-colonoscopies/,"Throughout history, U.S. presidents have always faced scrutiny over how much time they spend on the job versus how much time they dedicate to leisurely pursuits. And while it’s certainly understandable that the leader of the free world might need to occasionally get out of the office and unwind a bit, taking too much PTO can be a bad look. Case in point: President Biden has already spent 28 days of his presidency getting colonoscopies.  Outrageous! Our tax dollars should NOT be going towards pampering politicians with fancy gastroenterological procedures. According to information obtained through a FOIA request, President Biden has spent a cumulative 28 days of his first 209 days in office getting top-of-the-line colon examinations at Walter Reed Medical Center, frequently abandoning his duties to treat himself to the finest colorectal treatments taxpayers’ money can buy. That’s right: Not even a year into his presidency, Joe Biden has already devoted nearly an entire month—not to mention hundreds of millions of dollars in travel and security costs—to his little hobby of having a doctor check inside his anus for unusual growths and lesions. Knowing that Biden is having a lubricated medical camera snaking around his bowels every single week while the country suffers from wildfires and surging Covid-19 variants should be maddening to conservatives and liberals alike.  To put this in context, no previous president has spent even half the time getting colonoscopies in their first term as Biden has, with Dwight Eisenhower coming in at a distant second with a cumulative 13 days of colonoscopies in the same timeframe. Being president is certainly a high-stress job, and taking time away from the Oval Office is definitely sometimes necessary. But to blow a small country’s GDP getting multiple elective colonoscopies every single week when millions of Americans are struggling to make ends meet is truly unconscionable. Yes, men of a certain age do need their anuses probed for abnormalities on a more regular basis than the general population, but one or two trips to the doc per year should be more than enough.  Shame on you, Mr. President. We expected more of you.  Considering the unprecedented anxiety everyday Americans are facing right now, this is very disappointing to see from a president who campaigned on fighting for the little guy. Biden better cut back on the colonoscopies ASAP, otherwise he might as well just hand over the 2024 election on a silver platter."
"Jesus, Dad, We’re Eating: Dad Just Casually Revealed During Dinner That He Had A 4-Year-Old Sister Who Died",N/A,https://clickhole.com/jesus-dad-were-eating-dad-just-casually-revealed-during-dinner-that-he-had-a-4-year-old-sister-who-died/,"Looks like all hope of enjoying a normal family meal just went out the window, because someone just deployed the conversational equivalent of an atom bomb without so much as a second thought: Dad just casually revealed during dinner that he had a four-year-old sister who died. Jesus, man. That’s a lot to drop on everybody during Thai food night. The frankly uncalled-for revelation came out of nowhere during an otherwise lighthearted dinner table conversation about climbing trees: Sis was discussing how she wished there were some kind of climbing gym that approximates tree climbing instead of rock climbing, and Dad offhandedly followed up by mentioning that his parents had forbidden him from climbing trees after his four-year-old sister Ruby fell out of one when he was six and broke her neck and died. This is a piece of tragic family history Dad’s never once told us before, or even told Mom judging by the utterly shocked expression on her face, and now the guy’s just cavalierly putting it out there like it’s just an ordinary bit of smalltalk. But guess what, Dad, it’s not! No one knows what the hell to do with this information other than just sit there in awkward silence and wait for someone to change the topic.  Obviously talking about loss is a complicated thing, but this definitely isn’t the kind of shit people want to learn about while they’re just trying to eat their fucking cashew chicken. It would be one thing if it were an uncontrollable outburst of intense grief, but Dad just nonchalantly mentioned it like he was rattling off sports trivia, and now he’s already back to eating his pad thai as he waits for somebody to take the bait. While we’ll admit that there’s probably no perfectly frictionless way to reveal the existence of your long-dead sibling after years of silence, you could at least have the manners to wait until after dessert to take this whole goddamn “emotional vulnerability” thing for a test drive for the first time in your life. Honestly, what the hell, Dad? We only order takeout from the Thai place maybe once a month, and now instead of focusing on how good the food is, Dad’s making us think about this dead child who would have been our aunt. Or wait, is she still our aunt even though she died as a little kid? Fucking hell, that’s not the kind of question we wanted to be asking ourselves over these amazing beef satays. Sis is so hung up on this she’s barely even touched her duck panang curry, even though she’d spent the whole afternoon talking about how much she was looking forward to it. Great going, Dad! Now everybody’s appetites are just as dead as your goddamn secret sister. Maybe next time you want to spring some shit on us about a dead relative or the rarely seen emotional interior that lurks beneath your stoic facade of old-school masculinity, you can do it when the ensuing atmosphere of discomfort and uncertainty won’t fuck up $80 worth of Thai food. Ugh, really wish Dad could have kept a lid on this shit until we’d finished eating. We’re probably just gonna fridge the rest of our Tofu Miracle and have it later as leftovers, because there’s no way we can finish it now after the stunt Dad just pulled. "

"Hell Yes! Tampax Has Released A New Line Of Cheaper, Much Shittier Tampons For Women Who Know For A Fact They Aren’t Going To Be Playing Any Sports In The Foreseeable Future",N/A,https://clickhole.com/hell-yes-tampax-has-released-a-new-line-of-cheaper-much-shittier-tampons-for-women-who-know-for-a-fact-they-arent-going-to-be-playing-any-sports-in-the-foreseeable-future/,"When it comes to period products, a lot of the options on shelves cater to people who need reliable all-day protection for their active lifestyles. But one awesome brand just came out with a new product for those who don’t necessarily need all the bells and whistles: Tampax has released a new line of cheaper, much shittier tampons for women who know for a fact that they aren’t going to be playing any sports in the foreseeable future. Hell yes! This is awesome. The new line, called Tampax Adequate, is intended as an affordable option for women who have no reason to pony up for high-end sport tampons that can withstand high-intensity workouts they know they’ll never do. The Adequate tampons boast a shapeless, wadded-up design that’s perfect for those whose sedentary lifestyles aren’t exactly putting their menstrual products’ integrity to the test. In a TV spot for the new tampons, a tired-looking woman shuffles from her kitchen table to her bathroom, where she pulls out what looks like some bunched-up toilet paper tied together with a rubber band. Smiling, she says “This’ll do,” before the commercial cuts to her asleep on her sofa while a “Gilmore Girls” rerun plays on the TV in the background. “Tired of shelling out for 360-degree, athlete-tested leak defense that a couch-dwelling lump like yourself definitely doesn’t need?” a voiceover says. “Try Tampax Adequate: because you’re barely moving anyway.” In another commercial for the Adequate line, a spectator at a tennis tournament runs into Naomi Osaka in the stadium bathroom while digging through her purse for a tampon. Naomi pulls a sleek, sport-style tampon out of her gym bag and kindly hands it to the woman, who then tosses it in the trash and says, “Thanks, but I really don’t need something that fancy—any ol’ piece of crap will work for me.” She then finds one of her Tampax Adequates and shows it to Naomi, saying “I haven’t jumped in five years. This will be fine.” We then cut to Naomi engaged in a fast-paced tennis match while the woman from the bathroom watches in the stands, eating a hot dog.  Wow! While the Tampax Adequate tampons certainly don’t seem like anything special, they’re exactly what millions of lazy, out-of-shape women need out of a menstrual product. Kudos to Tampax for making products for women of all types."
Maintaining Their Standards: ‘People’ Magazine Has Announced That There Will Be No Sexiest Man Alive For 2021 As No One Has Shown Themselves To Merit The Title,N/A,https://clickhole.com/maintaining-their-standards-people-magazine-has-announced-that-there-will-be-no-sexiest-man-alive-for-2021-as-no-one-has-shown-themselves-to-merit-the-title/,"At a time when many publications are lowering their editorial standards to stay competitive in an increasingly volatile media industry, it appears that one of the country’s most popular print magazines is taking a bold stand and putting principles over profits: People has announced that there will be no Sexiest Man Alive for 2021, as no one has shown themselves as worthy of the title. Wow! Kudos to them for refusing to compromise.  Since 1985, People has bestowed its yearly honor of Sexiest Man Alive on a male celebrity whose sheer hotness makes him the most desirable man on the planet, but according to the gossip mag’s editorial board, there are currently no famous hunks who are sufficiently irresistible to deserve the 2021 prize.  “Given the truly jaw-dropping studs who’ve won in past years, such as Richard Gere, Johnny Depp, and Michael B. Jordan, we feel it’s important to maintain the high standards of sexiness we’ve already established, and we believe it would dilute the integrity of the title if we award it to anyone who isn’t truly, transcendentally hot,” People announced in a statement. “As a result, we have decided to offer no award this year and will resume in 2022 when there’s a new class of drop-dead gorgeous Hollywood boy toys to consider.” To further explain the decision, People took care to detail the rigorous rubric against which they judge their potential Sexiest Men, weighing such factors as ab definition, jawline prominence, and steeliness of gaze. The selection process begins at the start of each year when the magazine staff considers thousands of nominations to draw up a shortlist of potential candidates for the prize, which this year consisted of approximately 30 actors and musicians who demonstrated a “remarkable capacity to inspire lust.” However, after months of research and public surveys, the awards committee was not satisfied that any candidate on the shortlist had “the goods” necessary to make teen girls and horny moms alike get all hot and bothered.  “Upon careful and extensive deliberation, we have determined that while Harry Styles is cool, he is not swoon-worthy enough that our readers would clamor for images of him dripping in sweat and tugging at his shirt for the camera. Further, Dwayne Johnson remains sexy, but his sexiness has not increased by a sufficient degree since his 2016 win to warrant a second title,” People explained. “With no markedly exceptional candidates who clearly outshine their peers, we cannot in good faith name anyone the Sexiest Man Alive this year, but we’re hopeful that 2022 will bring some shirtless, glistening contenders who are worthy of the esteemed honor of being ogled by our millions of readers.” While this was undoubtedly a difficult decision for People, you’ve got to admire them for sticking to their guns and doing what’s necessary to preserve their editorial renown. Here’s hoping that the move inspires other publications to recommit themselves to newsroom integrity."
Amazing! Gmail Will Now Warn You If The Person You’re Trying To Ask For A Favor Actually Hates Your Fucking Guts,N/A,https://clickhole.com/amazing-gmail-will-now-warn-you-if-the-person-youre-trying-to-ask-for-a-favor-actually-hates-your-fucking-guts/,"Reaching out to someone for a favor is a stressful experience that can fire up all sorts of social anxieties. Thankfully, one email service has stepped up to ease your insecurity: Gmail will now warn you in the person you’re trying to ask for a favor actually hates your fucking guts. Amazing! This is a total game changer. From now on, whenever your drafted email includes a phrase like “Just wondering if you’d…” or “Thought I’d reach out to see if…”, Gmail’s awesome new feature will kick into gear to determine whether the person you want something from would actually like to help you, or if they’d straight up rather you drop dead than ever send them a message.  The feature works by analyzing data from your inboxes and chat records to determine what the other person likely thinks of you, and if the software finds any red flags – for instance, a history of the recipient ignoring your previous emails, or Google Hangouts messages where they secretly referred to you as an “annoying know-it-all” – Gmail will prompt you with a text box that reads “Our data tells us that this person actually fucking hates you. Do you still want to send?” Hell yes! This is going to save people from so much embarrassment.  Better yet, the feature also offers several fail-safes to prevent you from further mortification if you overrode their initial warning not to send an email. That means that even if you brushed past Gmail’s suggestion to avoid asking someone you interned with nine years ago to look over your resume and put in a good word for you with their hiring managers, Gmail flat out won’t let you shoot them a follow up email the next week to see if they’ve had a chance to check out your materials. Instead, a warning message reading, “THIS PERSON LITERALLY DOESN’T GIVE A SHIT ABOUT YOU,” will start flashing on your screen, preventing you from hitting “send.” Plus, this new feature will even evaluate whether or not your request seems reasonable given what Gmail’s data has to say about your relationship to the recipient. For instance, if you try to ask your former high school classmate whose party invitations you’ve automatically deleted since graduation to photograph your wedding for free, a prompt will appear suggesting, “Maybe offer to pay them? If not, there’s a 89% chance they will start texting your mutual friends about what a weird thing you just did.” This is so cool! If you’ve ever worried if the person you’re emailing actually thinks you fucking suck, you’ve just been thrown a major life raft. Shout out to Gmail for raising the bar once again!"
"Breaking The Billionaire Mold: Larry Ellison Has Announced That Rather Than Going To Space, He Is Going To Attempt To Squeeze Through A Dog Door",N/A,https://clickhole.com/breaking-the-billionaire-mold-larry-ellison-has-announced-that-rather-than-going-to-space-he-is-going-to-attempt-to-squeeze-through-a-dog-door/,"In recent years, the ultra-wealthy have taken over the space race, and it seems like virtually every big-name billionaire is jockeying to be the next one to rocket beyond Earth’s atmosphere. However, it looks like at least one prominent CEO is bucking this trend and pursuing a much different—though equally ambitious—goal as his peers: Larry Ellison has announced that rather than going to space, he is going to attempt to squeeze through a dog door. Wow! He is truly going where no billionaire has gone before. Earlier this week, Ellison announced plans to squish his entire body through the dog door that he installed in his Woodside, California estate for his pet border collie five years ago. The Oracle CEO says he has spared no expense in assembling an elite team of physicists and engineers to assist him with the feat, including a 20-person team dedicated exclusively to the mechanics of fitting his body into the doggy door, and another 20-person team focused on facilitating a safe exit out of the doggy door without him getting stuck. According to Ellison, the teams have been secretly working on the project for several years now and have already carried out several high-stakes test runs, including a 2017 experiment in which a Crisco-greased Oracle employee was blasted at a speed of 3,000 feet per second from a custom $2 billion high-velocity, precision-guided cannon yet tragically disintegrated before reaching the target. Another failed trial involved tethering Ellison to a pack of trained raccoons and having them dash through the dog door with Ellison in tow. These early attempts, while costly and ultimately ineffective, convinced Ellison and his team of the viability of their mission, and the group is now confident that they’ll be able to execute a successful test run by the end of 2021. It sounds like this could be a huge leap forward for humankind! Ellison has already sunk over $4 billion into the project, much of which has gone towards developing different prototypes of the skin-tight body suit he’ll don during the feat, as well as the tankards of baby oil required to ease his passage through the dog flap. Some critics say he is simply flaunting wealth that could be used for more altruistic purposes, and many are questioning the necessity of certain eye-popping expenditures, such as spending over $23 million on developing a motorized brush to sweep dog hair off of Ellison as he attempts to squeeze his face through the 12-inch-wide opening. But according to the billionaire, the project will have a net positive effect on American society, regardless of its cost. “Dozens of humans have made it into space, but not a single one has jammed his or her entire body through my dog door—this is a new frontier,” Ellison said. “If I can get from my laundry room into my backyard using only a small square opening meant for animals, I know I will inspire millions of people to achieve their dreams, whether it’s young women trying to break into STEM or first-generation immigrants running for public office. I want to show them that there’s no such thing as impossible.” What a bold mission. With so many other billionaires singularly focused on commercial space flight, it’s refreshing to see Ellison using his resources to blaze entirely new trails. Here’s hoping he’s able to achieve his goal and inspire humanity to dream bigger."
Cringe Overload: This 83-Year-Old Still Thinks He’s Hip Enough To Know What 75-Year-Olds Consider Cool,N/A,https://clickhole.com/cringe-overload-this-83-year-old-still-thinks-hes-hip-enough-to-know-what-75-year-olds-consider-cool/,"We all know a few people who stubbornly refuse to act their age, but this guy might be the most pathetic case of arrested development we’ve ever seen: This 83-year-old still thinks he’s hip enough to know what 75-year-olds consider cool. Oof. Just act your age, buddy! Not a day goes by at Meadow Brooks Retirement Community that 83-year-old Mike Sterle doesn’t completely humiliate himself by acting like he’s still savvy to all the trends, fashion, and lingo of the younger 75-year-old residents. Pretty much anytime a group of 75-year-olds sits down to listen to some Bill Haley & His Comets LPs, Sterle will show up like clockwork to kill the vibe and plunge everyone into uncomfortable silence by trying to brag about how he once saw the Andrews Sisters perform live as if any of them give half a shit about that. And God forbid any of them start dancing, because Sterle will almost certainly bust out the jitterbug in a truly mortifying display of his total disconnect from 75-year-olds’ culture that leaves the whole room wincing at his colossal misfire. It’s hard to overstate how many facepalms and exasperated sighs Sterle draws walking around the facility in his argyle socks and sweater vest outfit like he just magically stopped aging in 2013. He probably thinks he’s hot shit liking all his younger peers’ Facebook posts about how they used to drink water straight from the hose and get milk from the milkman, when in reality it comes off as so jarring and desperate that most of them just quietly block him on the spot. To make things even worse, Sterle is always creepily lurking around the orientation seminars to hang out with the newer retirees who don’t know to ignore his bullshit yet, despite the fact that his octogenarian ass got moved into the assisted living wing years ago after a scary fall getting off of an elevator. Jesus Christ dude, this isn’t a good look. “At first we thought maybe he had some kind of weird dementia that makes him think he’s eight years younger, but he clearly remembers enough recent events that this has to just be an unbearably cringey personal thing,” said Jim Frith, a 75-year-old resident who frequently has to endure Sterle’s bizarre posturing. “All the other 83-year-olds are totally fine hanging out together talking about classmates of theirs who got polio or their service in Korea, but Mike just has to feel like he’s one of the cool young 75-year-olds despite the fact that he was already old enough to vote for Eisenhower while we were still in grade school. People usually feel awkward enough to give him a little sympathy laugh when he calls someone ‘Daddy-O,’ and I think he somehow interprets that as the other 75-year-olds genuinely thinking he’s one of us instead of them having no idea how to deal with such a trainwreck of a guy.” Man, some people just refuse to age with grace and dignity. Here’s hoping Sterle can stop clinging so pathetically to the past and accept that nobody stays 75 forever!"
Probably A Mixup But Still Pretty Cool: This Dying Man Is Seeing Howie Mandel’s Life Flash Before His Eyes,N/A,https://clickhole.com/probably-a-mixup-but-still-pretty-cool-this-dying-man-is-seeing-howie-mandels-life-flash-before-his-eyes/,"Death is a terrifying experience that we can’t comprehend until it eventually happens to us. Luckily for one terminally ill man at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City, a few wires got crossed on his way out the door, resulting in a pretty awesome send-off: This dying man just saw Howie Mandel’s life flash before his eyes. Wow! He should definitely be seeing events from his own life instead of Howie Mandel’s, but still, it’s pretty neat. Earlier today, 56-year-old Mark Cheever’s years-long battle with prostate cancer took a turn for the worst as his bodily functions began shutting down, signaling that the end was year. Yet for some reason, when his consciousness started to fade, Cheever’s brain released stress chemicals that triggered a time-lapse of not his own memories but rather the memories of actor and television personality Howie Mandel, giving the dying man a POV view of all of Mandel’s most significant life events, from being cradled by Mandel’s mother as an infant, to crafting the voice of Gizmo from Gremlins in a Hollywood recording booth, to his final Deal Or No Deal taping before leaving to host his practical joke series Howie Do It. Surrounded by his wife and children—who wept as they watched the life fade from Cheever’s eyes, totally unaware that his last moments on Earth were spent running through Mandel’s childhood in Canada, his struggle with obsessive-compulsive disorder, and his decision to start shaving his head and sporting a soul patch—Cheever felt a powerful sense of peace as he spent his dying moments experiencing the life of a celebrity thanks to some extraordinary cosmic mixup. A tear rolled down Cheever’s cheek as he saw precious memories from Mandel’s distant and recent past, such as performing stand-up comedy for massive crowds in the 1980s, making love to Mandel’s wife for the very first time, the birth of Mandel’s children, receiving a star on Hollywood’s walk of fame, and being hired as a host for America’s Got Talent—giving him a taste of stardom after a lifetime of relative anonymity. Then, just as the rapid-fire sequence of Mandel’s memories finished flashing through his mind, the EKG machine at his bedside flatlined, signaling that Cheever had passed away.  Wow. We’re not gonna lie, that sounds like a pretty cool way to go! Though something clearly went wrong here, having Howie Mandel’s entire life flash before your eyes has gotta be one of the better experiences one can have in the moments before death. Wherever Cheever is now, you can bet he is grinning ear-to-ear from this amazing experience. Rest in peace, sir!"
Dangerous Overcorrection: Police Haven’t Caught A Witch In Over 300 Years,N/A,https://clickhole.com/dangerous-overcorrection-police-havent-caught-a-witch-in-over-300-years/,"The Salem witch trials remain one of the most notorious moral panics in U.S. history, their bloody legacy now serving as a cautionary tale for due process and wrongful accusations. But while it’s undeniably a positive thing that we no longer wantonly execute old women who exhibit vaguely witch-like traits in America, it’d be a mistake to let our guard down altogether, yet unfortunately it appears that’s exactly what has happened: Police in the U.S. haven’t caught a witch in over 300 years.  Wow. This is clearly a dangerous overcorrection. According to a recent ProPublica report, the last time a witch was successfully caught and executed was 1693—that’s right, 328 years ago. Since then, there’s not been a single official record of a witch being taken into custody anywhere throughout the United States, let alone executed for their crimes against God and their devotion to carrying out Satan’s will. Data suggests that public stigma has deterred local and federal law enforcement from pursuing witchcraft practitioners, with fewer than three percent of U.S. police departments allocating any budget whatsoever to defending citizens against the demonic behaviors and heresies of witches. While it’s certainly good that our legal system has embraced due process to protect the falsely accused, this unintended consequence has left Americans totally vulnerable to dark magic carried out in service of pleasing the Devil.  “One major fallout of the Salem witch trials is that U.S. police have entirely deprioritized witches,” said the ProPublica report. “No police department wants to be the first in over three centuries to wrongfully detain a witch, so they’ve avoided the issue entirely. Unfortunately, because no witches have been caught since 1693, we have zero data on witch-related crimes, or how many may have gotten away with child-stealing, performing love charms, casting spirits of madness unto livestock, or rendering innocent virgins deaf as a result of lax anti-witchcraft policies.”  Absolutely disturbing. How are our communities supposed to feel safe with the police turning a blind eye to witchcraft?   Equally unsettling is the fact that very little, if anything, is being done in terms of witchcraft prevention in communities around the country. It’d be one thing if police, in lieu of actually arresting and prosecuting witches, were at the very least enacting common-sense anti-witchcraft measures such as hanging thistle-twigs over doorways, burying eggshells to keep witches from using them as boats to travel to different realms, or immediately killing and burning any mature cows who do not give milk in plenty. But, troublingly, hardly any police departments are taking even the most basic, no-brainer precautions such performing exorcisms on mute children or touching crucifixes to crooked-nosed wretches to see if they burst into flames, leaving the American people alarmingly susceptible to spells and curses of all kinds.  The implications here are unsettling, to say the least. It is possible, if not probable, that Satan Himself may be corrupting hundreds of new women every day, tempting them into lives of blasphemy and promiscuity in exchange for signing away their souls in His Ledger, without any fear of police reprisal. To see an animal in the woods and know it very well could be a witch who has shifted shapes, or the conjured spirit of an occultist’s familiar, is downright harrowing. No American should have to worry that a demonic apparition of a neighbor might appear in their home to turn their baby into a rat using sorcery.  On the one hand, it’s undoubtedly good that we’ve instituted due process since the events of Salem. On the other hand, the idea that demonic hags are flying through the air at night, enacting the Devil’s work, and having orgies deep in the forest around a bonfire, totally unchecked by the law, should terrify all Americans. What do you think? Should police start cracking down on witchcraft again? Let us know in the comments."

So unspeakably sad. Poor little guy is really taking this hard. Since finding his beloved pet gecko Zigs upside down and unresponsive in his terrarium earlier this morning, six-year-old Arthur Dearden has been inconsolably wandering his home and howling lamentations about “the fragile thread of legacy, now untimely severed!” Hearing Arthur’s heaving sobs as he mournfully declares that even the strongest roots can do naught but wither when the budding tree is felled by fate’s cruel axe, you can’t help but get a little choked up in sympathy. He had clearly never counted on out-living the small, leopard-spotted lizard, and now the pain of being left without a scion to carry on his line is crashing over him like a tidal wave, leaving nothing for him to do but gnash his teeth and rend his Paw Patrol pajama shirt in despair. Arthur took it particularly hard when his mother brought out a shoebox to use as a coffin to bury his gecko in the backyard, throwing himself on top of it and shouting “O, to see the limitless horizons of tomorrow interred in a pine box is more than any soul can bear!” He then retreated to his bedroom to sit among his collection of Harry Potter Lego sets, running his fingers over them and muttering “Such grand inheritance amassed over generations, to be bequeathed now only to the ash heap…” Arthur’s grief over the loss of his heir is so all-consuming that he’s been refusing all food and drink, even though his parents ordered from his favorite pizza place for dinner to try to cheer him up. Some wounds simply cannot be healed. “Out, out brief candle!” wept Arthur over the still, lifeless body of his gecko, letting out an anguished ululation after remembering how it used to freak out when he’d drop a live cricket for it to eat. “Would that Atropos had turned her blade to my life instead of his! I am without successor, without future, without purpose, persisting only to suffer the cruel mockery of my own yet-beating heart.” Arthur has since locked himself away in his room, using an Etch A Sketch to obsessively design a grand mausoleum for the lizard that he also seems to intend to serve as a gravesite for his lineage as a whole. God, you’ve really gotta feel for this kid. This is such a heartrending scene. Here’s hoping Arthur’s parents hurry up and buy him another gecko ASAP before the terrible pain of his loss gets any worse."
Neat! Researchers Have Determined That You Can Just Give A Dog Breast Implants And Nothing Bad Happens,N/A,https://clickhole.com/neat-researchers-have-determined-that-you-can-just-give-a-dog-breast-implants-and-nothing-bad-happens/,"Every day, exciting discoveries are being made that help us better understand the world around us, and one team of scientists just produced some extraordinary new findings that will surely change the way we think about man’s best friend forever: Researchers have determined that you can just give a dog breast implants and nothing bad happens.  Neat! Not sure what we’ll do with this knowledge, but definitely good to know.  Earlier this week, a team of researchers at Stanford University announced the results of a three-year, $120 million study that found that silicone breast implants pose no significant risks to dogs, concluding that, if you for whatever reason want to give your dog boobs, it’d probably be fine to do so. While it was originally hypothesized that breast implants would “probably not feel that good for dogs and maybe make them sick,” the researchers were heartened to discover that none of the 100-plus canines whose breasts they surgically augmented ended up getting sick or dying, and they instead mostly seemed to “just roll with it,” quickly adapting to their new buxom proportions.  “Other than a short adjustment period following the surgeries where the dogs would sometimes knock over their water bowls with their new breasts or bark at them after mistaking them for squirrels in their peripheral vision, our subjects adapted to their new curvaceous bodies with remarkable ease,” said lead researcher Amy Velting, adding that many of the dogs even seemed to become more confident with the breasts, oftentimes flaunting them out on walks or shimmying them flirtatiously to hip hop music. “Granted, we did observe some balance issues with smaller breeds who were given D-Cups or greater, but once we equipped them with properly fitted bras that gave them the support they needed, they stopped toppling over and quickly adjusted to their voluptuousness.”  “At this time, we can say with utmost confidence that there is no medical reason to avoid giving your dog breast implants if that’s something that you and your dog want.”  We’ll keep that in mind! Kudos to the Stanford researchers for making this groundbreaking discovery. Whether you’re interested in getting your dog a beautiful new pair of breasts or not, you’ve got to admit it’s nice to know it’s not gonna cause any weird problems. Science FTW!"
Huge Relief: This Child Is Only Bald And Hooked Up To A Bunch Of Tubes For Fun,N/A,https://clickhole.com/huge-relief-this-child-is-only-bald-and-hooked-up-to-a-bunch-of-tubes-for-fun/,"There are few things more heartbreaking than seeing a child hooked up to IVs and a ventilator, unless, that is, the child isn’t actually suffering, which thankfully is the case for one little boy in Houston, TX: This kid is only bald and hooked up to a bunch of tubes for fun.  Phew! So glad to hear he’s okay! At first glance, the sight of nine-year-old Theodore Danielson and all of the medical equipment he’s connected to is a sobering reminder of our mortality and the cruelty of life, but look a little closer and you’ll see that he is perfectly healthy. In fact, Theodore just thinks having breathing tubes shoved up one’s nose looks awesome, and after several consecutive Christmases where the only thing on his wish list was “I want to look sick,” his parents finally caved and bought him some wires at Home Depot that he could use to pretend he had some kind of terminal disease.  While Theodore’s baldness certainly looks like it’d be the result of chemotherapy, and his pale, gaunt skin suggests he’s fighting through something terrible, he really just makes his mom shave his head and apply white face makeup each day to make him look ghastly so he can play a game called “kidney failure” that entails writhing pitifully on the floor and taking frequent urine samples while occasionally pausing to go make modifications to his will. And although Theordore might tell you that he’s suffering from a range of diseases, be it leukemia, tuberculosis, or malaria, his parents confirm he’s got a perfect bill of health and is merely going through a phase.  Fair enough! Given Theodore’s deeply upsetting and sickly appearance, this story could’ve been a real buzzkill, but thankfully that’s not the case. And while we’re relieved to know that there isn’t actually anything wrong with Theodore, we can also take some comfort knowing that, if he ever does become gravely ill, he will absolutely knock it out of the park.

Sounds good, Burger King! Burger King took to Twitter earlier this morning to let everyone know it’s cool with them if you want to quickly hit up their drive-thru when you’re a little drunk. Check out the tweets below:  Roger that, Burger King! Thank you for providing a judgement-free zone for folks craving a greasy pick-me-up after a bit of boozin’.

The Queen Has Arrived: Mom Just Walked Into Chipotle And Said ‘Rice Plate’ To The First Employee She Saw And Refuses To Answer Any Further Questions,N/A,https://clickhole.com/the-queen-has-arrived-mom-just-walked-into-chipotle-and-said-rice-plate-to-the-first-employee-she-saw-and-refuses-to-answer-any-further-questions/,"Some people are just born to rule, and this story is proof that everyday people truly can have blue blood running through their veins: Mom just walked into Chipotle and said “rice plate” to the first employee she saw, and she refuses to answer any further questions. Damn! The queen is here, and you’d better do her bidding. Mom may just be some middle-aged lady from Michigan, but she might as well assume the throne given the way she’s acting right now in Chipotle, where she has just insisted on receiving a “rice plate” (not a real menu item) while refusing to give any of the instructions necessary to create it. When Mom first strode into the restaurant today after a busy morning of running two errands, she wasted no time calling out “rice plate” to the 17-year-old girl behind the counter while it was still nowhere near her turn. When the young woman asked “white or brown” in order to get Mom’s rice preference, Mom only shook her head emphatically and repeated “Plate” while simultaneously pointing at the barbacoa and yelling “What is that?!” The employee was then left to parse out Mom’s request while Mom just stood there tapping at her phone, evidently trying to read an absolutely non-urgent text from Dad about the roof. Get this woman a rice plate, ASAP, or it’s going to be off with your head! Mom has been to Chipotle before, and so she should definitely know that she is required to pick a meat and then various toppings, but she clearly does not have time for such trifling matters and is instead looking off to the side and stoically repeating “I don’t want any sauce” while the girl behind the counter fruitlessly tries to figure out if there should be fajita veggies on her bowl or not. Totally unmoved by the fact that she is holding up the entire line, Her Royal Highness even addressed her fellow patrons directly, telling both them and the Chipotle employees, “I can’t have any of that, it hurts my stomach” without any indication whatsoever of what food item she is referring to. Right now, she has three different workers presiding over her plain bowl of rice and black beans and is no closer to letting them know how to finish it off. But it seems like that’s just how the Queen wants it, and what the Queen wants, she gets! Mom is truly wielding her royal power in Chipotle today, and she’s got everybody under her spell. After 65 years, we suppose it’s fair to say she earned the title. Bow down, Chipotle, for you are in the presence of Mom!"
Doing Damage Control: Miles Teller Just Had To Solemnly Tour The Smithsonian Air & Space Museum After Making Fun Of Hot Air Balloons,N/A,https://clickhole.com/doing-damage-control-miles-teller-just-had-to-solemnly-tour-the-smithsonian-air-space-museum-after-making-fun-of-hot-air-balloons/,"Oof. If you thought you were having a rough day, just be thankful you aren’t Miles Teller’s publicist, because they’re currently stuck dealing with a PR nightmare from Hell: Miles Teller just had to solemnly tour the Smithsonian Air & Space Museum after making fun of hot air balloons.  Yikes. This is a good first step to atone for his comments, but he’s still got a long way to go before he bounces back from this one.  The unfortunate saga began earlier this week, when Miles Teller tweeted out a series of insensitive jokes about hot air balloons: “@miles_teller: Whoever invented hot air balloons was like ‘let’s make a blimp but worse.’ Can’t think of a dumber way to fly.” “@miles_teller: There aren’t even chairs to sit on in a hot air balloon. You literally have to stand in a basket for hours on end. A basket with a max speed of 2mph. So fucking stupid lmao” “@miles_teller: Like, surely these guys have heard of planes. Not sure how you can see a plane and be like, ‘Nah, I’d rather fly in a slow-moving dipshit balloon that’s LITERALLY CONTROLLED BY FIRE and could be taken down by a fucking slingshot.’ smdh…” The comments were swiftly met with backlash, and while Teller deleted the tweets shortly after posting them, the damage had already been done, as thousands of users had taken screenshots of the posts and spread them widely across the Internet. From there, it wasn’t long before Teller was forced to tweet out a mea culpa acknowledging the harm that his ignorant comments towards hot air balloons had caused. He also revealed in his apology that he’d been contacted by the Smithsonian Air & Space Museum, who explained why his remarks were so hurtful and offered him a private tour of their hot air balloon exhibit to educate him on the aircrafts he’d so recklessly used his platform to disparage, which Teller accepted.  Then, just a day later, the Whiplash actor was photographed dressed in all black at the Smithsonian Air & Space Museum, nodding his head in deep personal reflection as he listened to a tour guide describe the rich history of hot air balloons and their significant role in the development of air travel. As the tour ended, he took the tour guide’s hand in his hand and deeply thanked them for enlightening him on this fascinating type of aircraft, pledging to use his influence to advocate for hot air balloons moving forward. Teller went on to release a statement that same afternoon announcing he’d be donating $50,000 across various organizations that promote hot air balloon research and awareness.  Wow. Teller’s P.R. reps deserve a major raise after scrambling to put out this fire!  Only time will tell whether this apology tour will make up for his ignorant hot air balloon remarks, but there’s no denying that Teller is handling this scandal as thoughtfully and respectfully as he can. Next time, you’d better think a little more before you tweet, Miles!"
Heartbreaking: Barron Trump Still Thinks Kathy Griffin Beheaded Donald Trump In 2017 And Screams In Terror Every Time He Sees His Father,N/A,https://clickhole.com/heartbreaking-barron-trump-still-thinks-kathy-griffin-beheaded-donald-trump-in-2017-and-screams-in-terror-every-time-he-sees-his-father/,"While Donald Trump may no longer be president, the events that unfolded when he was in office continue to leave a parade of damage in their wake, including a recent report that President Trump’s teenage son, Barron, still thinks Kathy Griffin beheaded his father in 2017 and screams in terror every time he sees him. Oof. You’ve gotta feel for the poor kid. This is a terrible way to live! Insiders with access to the Trump family have confirmed that every time Donald Trump walks into a room with Barron, Barron points at him and screams, “You’re supposed to be dead, old man! Stay away from me!” before running for a place to hide. The sources say that when Barron first saw the picture of Kathy Griffin holding a mask made up to look like the former president’s severed head, he nodded to himself and said, “Kathy Griffin has ripped off my old man’s head. I will not see Donald Trump ever again.” The next time Barron saw his father was three months later when President Trump passed Barron in the White House hallway. Upon seeing his father, Barron reportedly went white as a sheet and shrieked, “How are you here? You’re dead! My favorite comedian Kathy Griffin cut your head off and held it aloft in triumph! She ripped your eyes out of your lifeless skull! Don’t you dare haunt me!” He then sprayed President Trump with pepper spray and hid in the closet. This is just so sad. No boy should have to think his own father is a malevolent spirit who has returned from beyond the grave! According to reports, over the past year, Barron’s fear of his father has only grown worse. Whenever he sees his father he continues to shriek with fear and finds the fastest way out of the room. Last week Donald Trump walked up to Barron and said, “Hello, Barron,” and Barron screamed, “Float back up to Heaven, dead boy!” and leapt through a second-story window. This is just devastating. Sources familiar with the situation say that many people have tried to reassure Barron that his father is actually alive, but unfortunately the boy simply refuses to believe that the realistic Instagram photo of Kathy Griffin holding the ex-Commander-in-Chief’s severed head isn’t genuine. It’s heartbreaking how much trauma this photo continues to inflict on Barron—here’s hoping someone is able to convince him the image isn’t real sooner than later!"
Jumping The Gun: Three Couples In Their 60s Are Already On The Dance Floor At This Wedding Even Though No Music Is Playing And The Best Man Is Still Making His Speech,N/A,https://clickhole.com/jumping-the-gun-three-couples-in-their-60s-are-already-on-the-dance-floor-at-this-wedding-even-though-no-music-is-playing-and-the-best-man-is-still-making-his-speech/,"It’s no secret that older people take to the wedding dance floor the very second they get the chance, but some guests at this wedding in Alexandria, VA seem to be really, really jumping the gun: Three couples in their 60s are already on the dance floor at this wedding even though no music is playing and the best man is still making his speech. Relax, people. You’re gonna get to dance. Just give it some time. From the moment George and Maria Hernandez’s wedding reception began, it was clear that a few of the guests were getting pretty antsy to hit the dance floor, as several older couples from both the bride and groom’s families were seen tapping their toes throughout the entire meal. As soon as these couples finished eating, the men loosened their ties and the women kicked off their heels, and they then hopped up and started doing that move where they hold hands and just sort of tug alternatively on each other’s arms despite the fact that George’s brother had only just begun his best man speech and the DJ was away from his turntables getting food at the buffet.  Although no music has been playing whatsoever, the couples—tipsy on vodka cranberries and Michelob ULTRA—appear totally unfazed, and one uncle even seems to be mouthing the lyrics to “Boogie Shoes” while he and his wife flail their arms and shuffle side-to-side, completely ignoring the moving story George’s brother is telling about how he always wanted to be just like George growing up. Worse still, the couples have now started doing the Macarena, even though there are at least two hours left until the DJ will play that song, and at least 15 minutes left until the DJ plays any song.  C’mon, guys. Sure, there aren’t many places a 60-year-old can go out dancing, but just try to control yourselves a little while longer. Yes, dancing is fun, but that doesn’t mean that the newlyweds should have to do their first dance while friends of their parents that they barely know clumsily do the Cha-Cha Slide right next to them.  Seriously, hold your horses, old timers.  Though the couples’ behavior is definitely annoying, it’s still somehow preferable to that of the people in their 80’s who will spend the entire night seated at their table while looking absolutely miserable and complaining about how the venue’s air conditioning is too cold. Here’s hoping that all of these obnoxious guests will at least each gift the newlyweds a sizable check to make up for their out-of-control behavior."
Tackling Gun Violence: Legislators Now Recommend That Families Designate A Survivor On Trips To The Grocery Store,N/A,https://clickhole.com/tackling-gun-violence-legislators-now-recommend-that-families-designate-a-survivor-on-trips-to-the-grocery-store/,"Our lawmakers have long struggled to meaningfully address the ongoing gun violence crisis in the U.S., and while political divisions will likely impede any substantial reforms for the foreseeable future, it at least appears that some modest action is being taken in the meantime: Legislators are now urging families to designate a survivor on trips to the grocery store. Yes! This is definitely a good start.  In a statement released earlier today, a bipartisan group of lawmakers announced a non-binding resolution calling for a nationwide adoption of a new gun safety measure in which all American families would designate one person to stay home during trips to grocery stores, malls, and restaurants in order to protect themselves and their bloodline from the frequent mass shootings that plague the U.S.  “It is crucial for the wellbeing of this country to enact common-sense gun safety measures like this one so that when our loved ones get massacred by a mentally ill gunman while shopping at Walmart or attending grade school, there will at least be one surviving family member to carry on in their stead,” said California Rep. Mike Thompson, who leads the congressional task force on gun violence prevention, in the statement. “Tragically, it’s all too likely that an assault rifle might end up in the hands of someone who wants to use it to shoot up a Whole Foods, but, as you hide for your life in the cereal aisle, you can take comfort knowing that you’ll have a family member who’s still alive to make your funeral arrangements and mourn the preventable loss of life that so many thousands of Americans are devastated by each year.” “As your congressional leaders, we’re working tirelessly to enact robust legislation to ensure that the seemingly daily mass shootings in this country at the very least come with some sort of silver lining,” he continued before going on to concede that any real efforts they make to address the crisis will undoubtedly stall in the Senate. “It is also abundantly clear that there is a dire need for universal background checks in the U.S. to keep weapons out of the hands of those who shouldn’t have them, but since that won’t happen either, we’d advise for now that you just keep a designated family member at home when you go grocery shopping.” Thompson concluded by stating that it’s probably best to leave someone at home during all family vacations, trips to the movies, concerts, weddings, baptisms, doctors appointments, birthday parties, graduations, and sporting events as well, just to be safe.  This is definitely some encouraging progress in the effort to combat one of the most deadly threats facing the American people. And while it’s certainly not as comprehensive of a measure as some gun violence prevention advocates would prefer, it will hopefully nonetheless save at least a life or two whenever a gunman with an AR-15 takes the lives of many, many others."
Dedication To Her Craft: Mom Got Absolutely Shredded To Play One Of The Nuns In A Community Theater Production Of ‘The Sound Of Music’,N/A,https://clickhole.com/dedication-to-her-craft-mom-got-absolutely-shredded-to-play-one-of-the-nuns-in-a-community-theater-production-of-the-sound-of-music/,"Truly great actors are willing to do whatever it takes to disappear completely into their roles, and here’s a story about a performer whose extraordinary commitment to her craft is sure to make her a community theater legend: Mom got absolutely shredded to play one of the nuns in a local stage production of “The Sound Of Music.” Wow! Who knew she had it in her?!? Last month, Mom received an email informing her that after a grueling two-callback process, she had been cast as one of the singing nuns in the Madison Area Community Theater production of “The Sound Of Music,” and in an effort to fully inhabit the part, she immediately embarked on a bodybuilding regimen so punishing she is now barely recognizable as the Mom we all know. When rehearsals began, Mom resolved to lose 40 pounds of fat and put on 50 pounds of pure muscle mass in order to “do the role of Sister Margaretta justice,” rising at 4:30 each morning to weight train for three hours before guzzling down a breakfast of six raw eggs and jetting off to rehearsal at the local high school auditorium. During her cutting phase, Mom forewent all carbs, even when Aunt Ellen brought over her famous pound cake, and soon the excess fat starting melting off, revealing the twitching, muscle-bound frame Mom said she needed in order to “become” one of the nuns of Nonnberg Abbey. Between her nonstop hex bar squats and diligent creatine supplementation, Mom has turned her average post-menopausal physique into a terrifying, rock-hard body that her director (Mrs. Holliday from down the street) called “a potential distraction.” Earlier this week, the cast began running rehearsals in costume, and despite the baggy, form-concealing fit of Mom’s nun’s habit, you can still clearly see her enormous delts twitching underneath. And though her full six-pack is not visible while she and her fellow nuns sing “Maria” at the start of the show, an impressive network of huge pipe-like veins bulges alarmingly from her neck and forehead thanks to her obsessive efforts to cut her body fat to zero and replace it with a pro wrestler-like musculature. It wasn’t easy for Mom to eat pounds of boiled chicken and vegetables a day for weeks or to put in three-a-day workouts with her lifting coach Alonzo in the basement, but now that she’s on stage stealing scenes from the several other middle-aged women playing her fellow nuns, it’s clear her hard work paid off. Damn! Mom is truly establishing herself as one of the preeminent method actors of her time! The hard-earned transformation Mom made for this role is really something to admire. We never thought she would strength train at all, let alone dangerously dehydrate herself in a sauna so that her muscles would pop for her scenes in “The Sound Of Music,” but she’s done it, and we’re proud AF. Go Mom! You deserve a Tony!"
Dire Milestone: Rising Arctic Temperatures Will Soon Unfreeze A Fun-Loving Caveman Whose Antics Will Only Further Exacerbate Climate Change,N/A,https://clickhole.com/dire-milestone-rising-arctic-temperatures-will-soon-unfreeze-a-fun-loving-caveman-whose-antics-will-only-further-exacerbate-climate-change/,"Humanity is running out of time in our battle against climate change, and sadly, we’re about to cross a catastrophic tipping point from which there may be no return: Rising Arctic temperatures will soon unfreeze a fun-loving caveman whose antics will only further exacerbate climate change. It’s impossible to overstate the potential ecological consequences of this hard-partying little dude. According to a sobering new paper in the scientific journal Nature, humanity may only have years or even months before temperatures in the Arctic become hot enough to melt the glacier containing Groog, a rambunctious Ice Age man whose feisty lust for life is all but certain to accelerate the rate at which our planet warms. The paper speculates that once his icy prison thaws enough for him to escape, it will likely only take hours for Groog to see his first airplane and mistake it for an enormous, mouthwatering bird, prompting him to ignite a record-setting wildfire to barbecue it for a raucous blowout feast with all his friends. In addition to releasing tons of carbon into the atmosphere, this initiating event will make Groog incredibly lonely when none of his caveman friends show up, leading him to try to forget his sorrows through a series of ever more outrageous hijinks at unthinkable cost to our environment. The paper pulls no punches in laying out just how devastating Groog’s insatiable thirst for a good time will be to our planet, explaining in great detail how Groog will learn about surfing from an ad on the side of a bus and consequently destroy dozens of critical hydroelectric dams so he can hang ten off the resulting waves. It’s also likely that Groog’s outgoing nature and notoriety as an extreme surfer will make him an instant campus celebrity at a nearby college, where he’ll cause irreparable harm to the ozone layer by using can after can of aerosolized hairspray and deodorant in his attempts to woo a teaching assistant who bears an uncanny likeness to his former girlfriend Groogina. In one especially pernicious scenario, Groog may even end up inadvertently destroying years of research on carbon-capture technology in the process of evading campus security during an after-hours chase through the science labs due to a beer run gone wrong. Yikes. As bad as climate change already was, it’ll only get worse with Groog in the mix. “Once you unleash a caveman that boisterous into modern society, there’s no telling how many disastrous knock-on effects you’ll see in terms of the environment,” said Dr. Abigail Taffer, the lead researcher behind this alarming report. “He might cause massive oil spills to turn entire beaches into big fun Slip ‘N Slides, or joyride a bulldozer through ecologically vulnerable wetlands to try to flush out the mammoths he assumes are hiding in there. And while I don’t want to sound defeatist, if Groog is somehow able to return to the Arctic with a couple hundred cordless hair dryers to find and unfreeze the original Groogina, the next generation of Grooglets may be the nail in the coffin for life on earth as we know it.” This is truly upsetting news. A rowdy caveman like Groog is the last thing we need with climate change as bad as it already is. Here’s hoping humanity can come together to mitigate as much harm as possible before this excitable prehistoric dude gets here! "
"Powerful Act Of Mercy: When This Pediatrician Looked Into A Child’s Ear And Found A Tiny Family Of Polite, Well-Dressed Ants Begging Him Not To Tell Anyone, He Looked The Other Way",N/A,https://clickhole.com/powerful-act-of-mercy-when-this-pediatrician-looked-into-a-childs-ear-and-found-a-tiny-family-of-polite-well-dressed-ants-begging-him-not-to-tell-anyone-he-looked-the-other-way/,"Grab the tissues, because here’s a heartwarming story about the power of mercy and the incredible impact it can make on the lives of others: When this pediatrician looked into a child’s ear and found a tiny family of polite, well-dressed ants begging him not to tell anyone that they were there, he looked the other way. Beautiful. We really need more of this in the world! Earlier today, Dr. Anthony Tabachnik was conducting a routine physical on six-year-old Liam Russo when he noticed something unusual inside the boy’s ear: a small family of black garden ants, all dressed to the nines in 19th century-era suits and dresses, scurrying about the eardrum with great industriousness. Upon realizing they’d been discovered, the ant children gasped and alerted the ant father, whose eyes went wide with panic as he quietly urged his wife and children to remain calm. Then, after several moments of anxious deliberation amongst themselves, the ant family courteously bowed and curtsied to Dr. Tabachnik, after which the monocled patriarch stepped forward, tipped his microscopic top hat, and introduced himself. “G-g-greetings, kind sir!,” stammered the visibly nervous father ant to the doctor. “We are pleased to make your acquaintance. As you can see, my family and I have sought refuge in this young man’s ear, as our anthill was recently destroyed by an errant soccer ball. I understand that our presence may come as a surprise to you, just as it would if I were to discover a family of critters living on my own antenna! But do not be alarmed, for I assure you, we intend no harm to this boy and will only be taking shelter here until we can find a proper home in the dirt. Children, come, come! Introduce yourself to our lovely guest!”  In lock step, the ant children shyly stepped forward and introduced themselves one by one: “Patrice!” “Boadicea!” “Cordelia” “Percy!” “Baby Rhys!” Then they politely dismissed themselves to attend to their daily chores, tidying up the eardrum with tiny mops, dusters, and rags while singing a song called “Scrubbin’ Ears Is The Life For Me” in delightful four-part harmony. Though Dr. Tabachnik’s medical training would normally lead him to remove and/or exterminate an insect population living inside a child’s ear, he elected to continue hearing the ants out, finding their affable demeanor to be endearing and not at all threatening. “They’re good kids, aren’t they?” said the ant father to the doctor, clacking his mandibles with pride. “They’re my entire world. I don’t know if you’re a father yourself, but if so, surely you can understand the pride one feels for his young, as well the desire to keep them from harm. Thus, I must ask from the bottom of my heart that you refrain from squashing them and that you do not announce our presence to Master Liam, whose ear canal we have so happily settled in. We may be small, but our capacity for love is just as big as yours, which is why I must beg you to please show my humble little brood some grace.” The ant mother then lovingly took her husband’s hand and echoed his pleas, assuring the pediatrician that they were peaceful, God-fearing ants who don’t mean anyone harm and that they’d be forever indebted to him if he let them be. She then unraveled the blade of grass she’d wrapped around her thorax like a swaddle to reveal a teeny tiny larva gently throbbing in her arms, saying, “At the very least, I beg you, spare our young. They are innocent.” She then tenderly wrapped the larva back into her swaddle before suddenly regurgitating a pile of partially digested matter onto the ground for the other children to eat—a gross yet profoundly touching moment.   Dr. Tabachnik paused momentarily and considered the insect family, which surprisingly reminded him of his own family in many ways. Then, seemingly remembering his oath, he muttered “Do no harm” under his breath and removed the otoscope from Liam’s ear, announcing “Everything looks normal here!” before continuing on with the rest of the check-up without ever once mentioning the ant family.  Wow, we are seriously choking up right now. Faith in humanity restored! Let this be a reminder that, at the end of the day, we’re all more alike than different, and we should always strive to treat each other just like we’d want to be treated. Without a doubt, the ants in Liam’s ear will remember the pediatrician’s extraordinary act of mercy for the rest of their lives. Dr. Tabachnik, you are an absolute hero.

Devastating: This Man Just Realized He Scheduled His Own Wedding On The Day He Was Supposed To Perform Amateur Penis Enlargement Surgery On His Father,N/A,https://clickhole.com/devastating-this-man-just-realized-he-scheduled-his-own-wedding-on-the-day-he-was-supposed-to-perform-amateur-penis-enlargement-surgery-on-his-father/,"If you think your life is stressful, here’s a story about a man who’s currently facing an absolute nightmare of a scheduling conflict that’ll make your own problems feel much more manageable in comparison: This man just realized he scheduled his own wedding on the day he was supposed to perform amateur penis enlargement surgery on his father. Absolutely devastating. You’ve got to feel for this poor guy. When Gordon Samuelson of Hartford, Connecticut and his fiancée Claire officially set the date of June 4th, 2022 for their wedding, it should have been a happy occasion, but, sadly, Gordon realized yesterday that due to a logistical oversight, the day he’s scheduled to say his vows is the same day he’s slated to perform an improvised operation on his father’s penis to make it longer and wider. “I just don’t know what I’m going to do. On the one hand, Claire and I have already booked the venue and sent out save-the-dates to all our friends and family, but on the other hand, I’ve already bought all the sawdust and vinegar for my dad’s dick enhancement operation,” said Gordon while poring over his Google calendar trying to find a solution to his impossible problem. “And I can’t reschedule either event because we’ve already put down our deposit on the wedding venue and my dad already bought a billboard with his picture on it that says, ‘My normal dick becomes large on June 4th, 2022.’ There’s zero flexibility for me here.” God, what an awkward position to be in. To make matters worse, Gordon knows there will be dire consequences if he fails to keep either of these major commitments. “Claire said if I skipped our wedding then she’d break up with me,” he says. “But my dad told me that if I don’t do the surgery on him, then he’s going to walk around my wedding showing everyone his normal dick and saying, ‘This regular dinger of mine could have been big and large if my traitorous son had done garage surgery on me like he said he would.’ That would just be gutting for me. Everyone would be laughing at me at my own wedding. I wish I had never been born.” “My dad’s dick is called his penis and I promised him I’d make it humongous,” Gordon added. Gordon said that he toyed with numerous solutions: First, he considered performing the penis enlargement operation on his father at the altar, but he later realized this would be too boring for his fiancée and their guests to watch and that people might fall asleep before the operation was complete. Then he considered marrying his fiancée in his garage while performing the penis enlargement operation on his father, but he realized this probably wouldn’t work because the fumes from the vinegar and rocket fuel involved in the surgery might make his fiancée pass out. Then he considered murdering his father, performing the penis enlargement operation on his corpse, and then skipping his wedding. This seemed like a perfect solution until Gordon realized that if he killed his father he might go to jail. It really seems like there’s no way out for him. Oof. This is just incredibly sad. At the end of the day, Gordon knows that he only has himself to blame for his current crisis. His father’s penis enlargement surgery has been on the books for six years, and he should have double-checked his calendar before committing to this wedding date. Here’s hoping he finds a way out of this jam so that he’s able to get married and make his father’s penis larger."
Normalizing All Families: ‘Sesame Street’ Just Aired A Whole Episode For Kids Whose Dads Feel Emasculated By Elmo,N/A,https://clickhole.com/normalizing-all-families-sesame-street-just-aired-a-whole-episode-for-kids-whose-dads-feel-emasculated-by-elmo/,"Sesame Street has an amazing decades-long history of using its characters and storylines to address difficult topics in a way that children can understand, yet the show might’ve just outdone itself with a groundbreaking new episode that celebrates diversity and inclusion in a truly beautiful way: Sesame Street just aired a whole episode for kids whose dads feel emasculated by Elmo. Yes! This is so important for children to see. The new instant-classic episode, which debuted on HBOMax earlier this week, explores themes of shame, self-esteem, and masculinity as it follows a little girl named Maisie whose father is depressed because he will never be as strong and virile as Elmo. At the start of the episode, Maisie stands on Sesame Street pleading with her father to come out from behind a trash can, where he is hiding and sobbing because he’s too embarrassed to be seen anywhere near a puppet as cool and with as strong of a grasp on the alphabet as Elmo.  “I’m embarrassed because I’m not as awesome as Elmo—he’s got so much more body hair than me, he has an incredible crayon collection, and he refers to himself in third person in a way that just oozes swagger,” Maisie’s dad laments, adding that he could never muster the confidence to walk around in public without a shirt or pants like a total stud like Elmo does. “It’s no wonder he has beautiful, famous women like Katy Perry showing up at his house just to sing songs with him. He’s a real man, unlike me. I’m a disgrace.”  But then, just as Maisie starts to cry, thinking she is the only kid in the world whose dad is threatened by the huge-eyed Muppet, Big Bird appears and sings a heartwarming song about dads like Maisie’s, with uplifting lyrics like, “Elmo makes many dads insecure / With his screams so virile, his counting so assured / It’s totally natural if your dad starts to cry / Whenever he sees this loud red guy!” This is amazing. Many kids whose dads feel emasculated by Elmo are going to see themselves reflected on TV for the first time thanks to this episode! The episode also featured a poignant segment with Elmo himself. In it, Maisie’s dad trembles as he goes to shake Elmo’s hand, and Elmo, seeing that he’s intimidated, instantly makes Maisie feel better about her dad’s pitiful behavior. “Elmo never steal anyone’s wife, but some men afraid Elmo could if Elmo wanted to,” Elmo explains to Maisie as her father looks on in awe. “It perfectly normal fear—Elmo very macho and strong, plus Elmo friends with Blake Lively!”  As Maisie begins to smile, finally feeling less alone, Grover, Oscar the Grouch and the Count appear to lovingly pat Maisie’s dad on the head while he trembles nervously in the corner, googling “Be more like Elmo HOW” on his phone. Then, in the show’s final segment, we learn that the episode is presented by the letter T for “testosterone,” a hormone that Maisie’s dad suspects Elmo has much more of than he does—and though he is absolutely correct, Grover assures him that this isn’t anything to be ashamed of. The episode then ends on a heartwarming note as Elmo lets Maisie’s dad win in an arm wrestling contest, at which point Maisie’s dad smiles for the first time all episode and lifts her in the air, yelling, “I did it! I proved I am a cool, tough man just like Elmo!” So sweet! What an incredible half hour of TV. This important episode is going to do so much for kids in situations like Maisie’s, who may feel as though they have no support and no one who understands them just because their fathers are having self-esteem issues due to obsessively comparing themselves to Elmo. Our hats are off to Sesame Street for nailing it once again!"
Desperate For Attention: The Last Time You Saw This Frog It Was Wearing An Eyepatch On Its Other Eye,N/A,https://clickhole.com/desperate-for-attention-the-last-time-you-saw-this-frog-it-was-wearing-an-eyepatch-on-its-other-eye/,"It’s perfectly natural to want to feel special, but some people are so desperate for validation that their ploys for attention end up feeling pitiful and sad. Point in case: The last time you saw this frog it was wearing an eyepatch on its other eye. Um, literally what the hell, frog? Not sure who you’re trying to impress here, but it ain’t working.  Last week, when you visited Meadow Path Pond to read on one of the benches near the water, you noticed that the big frog who’s always by the storm drain was wearing an eyepatch over its right eye, yet curiously, today you saw that it’s wearing the eyepatch over its left eye, suggesting it never really needed the eyepatch in the first place. Worse still, every time you’ve looked up from your book today, you’ve noticed that the frog has hopped a little closer to you, sometimes even angling its head in your direction so that you have a clear view of its eyepatch, obviously hoping that you’ll notice and ask what happened to its eye. Well guess what, frog? NOT GONNA HAPPEN! That’s right. You can see right through this frog’s pathetic little game, and you’re not gonna give it the validation it wants so badly. Even now, as the frog hops towards you with a dirty dollar bill hanging out of its mouth, clearly showing off the fact that it has money, you refuse to acknowledge it and give it the attention it craves. You can tell that the other animals are annoyed with the frog, too, because the ducks beelined in the opposite direction when they saw it coming their way, and the carp that usually clamor at the water’s edge so people will throw stuff for them to eat have completely abandoned their post for the algae wad at the far end of the pond, where they don’t have to put up with the frog’s annoying performative croaking and its sad attempts to be liked.  Sheesh. This is definitely not what the frog was hoping would happen when it cooked up its eyepatch plan.  Well, let this be a wake-up call to you, frog: Everyone can sense your desperation, and it’s a really bad look. Just chill out and be yourself! There’s no need to fake some stupid eye injury to try to make people like you. If you keep this up, no one’s gonna want to hang out at the pond anymore, because your insecurity is really killing the otherwise pleasant vibe. Grow up, frog, and get your shit together!"
The Perils Of Climate Change: All The Bison In Yellowstone National Park Are Now Backwards,N/A,https://clickhole.com/the-perils-of-climate-change-all-the-bison-in-yellowstone-national-park-are-now-backwards/,"Climate change’s devastating impact on our ecosystem is growing apparent every year, and if this story is any indication of what unchecked global warming has in store for our planet, then we should be absolutely horrified: All the bison in Yellowstone National Park are now backwards.  Just awful. What a sobering glimpse into the new reality mankind has wrought with its reckless disregard for the environment. In recent years, researchers have documented countless alarming examples of animal populations struggling to adapt to ecosystems ravaged by greenhouse gas emissions, but this troubling new backwards bison phenomenon might be the most grim portent to date. According to Yellowstone officials, the park’s nearly 5,000 bison began showing small signs of turning backwards all the way back in 2011, but the problem has escalated at a terrifying pace in the years since, with over 98 percent of the park’s herd now facing 180 degrees in the totally wrong direction, a change that climate scientists fear may be irreversible. And as symptoms of global warming continue to intensify, the fallout from the backwards bison could potentially trigger far greater devastation on the park’s sensitive ecosystem as a whole. “By our estimates, it would take at least 2,000 years for the bison to naturally face forwards again, and that’s if we halted all forms of manmade greenhouse gas emissions starting today,” said John DiBattista, a biologist who monitors wildlife populations for the National Park Service. “After centuries of grazing on pastures to their right, these pastures are now on the bison’s left—the total opposite side of their evolutionary training, leaving these herds confused and vulnerable to starvation and predators. What this means for Yellowstone’s broader ecosystem remains to be seen, but at the current rate of climate shift, it’s very possible that every animal species in the park could be facing the wrong direction in less than 50 years. And if that doesn’t scare you, consider that the problems these bison are facing now will eventually impact humans—children born facing right today will grow up in a world that increasingly forces them to face left, obliterating life as we’ve known it for all of human history.” Absolutely terrifying. How did we let things get this bad? Anyone who remains even remotely skeptical about climate change just needs to look at photos of Yellowstone bison just 10 years apart, as there’s no way you can see the contrast of the normal-direction-facing bison from 2011 with the backwards-facing bison of today and not be scared shitless.  It is categorically undeniable that our planet is hurtling towards a hellishly backwards climate apocalypse, and way faster than we thought. And the saddest part of this story is that these bison are just a small harbinger of what’s to come. Whether we like it or not, we will reap what we have sowed."
Kind Of Cool In A Different Way: This Couple That Pulled Up Their Carpets Hoping To Find Hardwood Found Wee Man Instead,N/A,https://clickhole.com/kind-of-cool-in-a-different-way-this-couple-that-pulled-up-their-carpets-hoping-to-find-hardwood-found-wee-man-instead/,"Renovating an older house can lead to some fascinating discoveries about a home’s hidden features. That’s exactly what happened to Patricia and Charles Bregman of Fairfield, Iowa, who recently stumbled upon a pretty awesome find while refurbishing their floors: The couple pulled up their carpets hoping to find hardwood, but found Wee Man instead. Wow! Definitely not what they were expecting, but for sure kind of cool! As Patricia and Charles began remodeling their living room earlier this month, they held out hope that the flooring beneath the old carpeting might be beautiful hardwood, which would perfectly align with their vision for the space, yet upon investigation, they were disappointed to find that the hardwood was warped and unpresentable. However, their disappointment was slightly offset by the surprising discovery of Jackass star Jason “Wee Man” Acuña smiling and waving at them from underneath the rug. Though caught off guard by Wee Man, the couple was nonetheless more delighted to see him than they would be to see ugly linoleum or tile, and they warmly waved back at him and told him how much they enjoyed his “Anaconda Ball Pit” scene in Jackass 2.  Patricia—let down by the lack of quality hardwood flooring but also feeling that this chance encounter with Wee Man was pretty neat—asked the stuntman if he wanted a glass of water or anything to eat, which Wee Man politely declined before complimenting the couple in an attempt to fill empty space in the conversation, saying “Y’all look like you’re really in love, that rules,” after which he threw up the sign of the horns with both hands. Following an extended awkward silence, Wee Man then asked the couple if they’d like an autograph, or if they’d even want to do a stunt, such as gluing him to the ceiling or tasering him in the testicles, thinking it might be a nice treat for a fan of his to experience. Charles bashfully declined, saying he and Patricia had better get back to work on the living room. The couple then bid farewell to Wee Man, pried him up with a crowbar, and threw him in the dumpster that they’d rented for the renovation. Fun!  While this certainly isn’t quite what Patricia and Charles were hoping for when they pulled up the carpet, finding Wee Man was undoubtedly a pretty decent consolation prize. Whatever Wee Man was doing under their carpet, he just gave them a cool story that they’ll remember forever. Not bad!"
Beautiful And Accurate! This Woman Has A Wooden Sign That Says ‘Kitchen’ In Her Kitchen,N/A,https://clickhole.com/beautiful-and-accurate-this-woman-has-a-wooden-sign-that-says-kitchen-in-her-kitchen/,"Typically, decorating your house involves making some tradeoffs between form and function, but this story is about an incredible household item that’s just as practical as it is pleasing to the eye: This woman has a wooden sign that says “Kitchen” in her kitchen. Awesome! This sign is not just gorgeous—it’s also spot on. Linda Rothman of Montgomery, Alabama truly struck gold at T.J. Maxx when she was furnishing her kitchen, because this sign is a decorative flourish for the ages. Its rustic, etched-wood style gives the room a charming farmhouse look, and even better, its simple message is 100 percent fact-based and error free. Anytime Linda or her family are looking at the stylish sign, they can pinpoint with laser accuracy the exact room of the house in which they are standing (i.e. the kitchen), and that is a beautiful thing! When shopping for decor, Linda had many options to choose from, and she could’ve easily settled for a sign that said something vague and uninformative, like “HOME IS WHERE THE HEART IS,” or a sign that said something downright inaccurate, like “THIS IS THE BATHROOM,” but she instead nailed it right on the head with an attractive sign that serves as a shining beacon for all who are searching for the room where the stove and fridge are located.  Go, Linda! Linda is still deciding where to hang her “WHAT HAPPENS IN THE GARAGE STAYS IN THE GARAGE” sign, but we trust she’ll eventually knock it out of the ballpark just like she did with her kitchen sign. She’s just got that vision, and we could not be more impressed. Incredible work, Linda!"
Love Wins! Cap’n Crunch And Maxine Waters Have Reunited And Are Now Pregnant With Twins,N/A,https://clickhole.com/love-wins-capn-crunch-and-maxine-waters-have-reunited-and-are-now-pregnant-with-twins/,"The world was heartbroken in 2019 when news got out that Cap’n Crunch and U.S. congresswoman Maxine Waters had split after 27 years of marriage, but if you’re one of the millions of people who were devastated by the couple’s shocking divorce, prepare to have your faith in love restored: Cap’n Crunch and Maxine Waters have officially reunited and are now pregnant with twins! Yes! Love wins! In a joint statement released earlier today, Crunch and Rep. Waters confirmed that, after months of reflection, therapy, dentist appointments, and unfulfilling sexual trysts, the pair has rekindled their romance and will soon be starting a family, as each of them is pregnant with one of two twins. Separated in May of 2019, the couple stayed busy during their time apart, with Crunch living out his life-long dream of being a missionary in China and Waters reading her way through nearly all of the Where’s Waldo? books at her local library.  While neither of them had necessarily been hoping to get back together, fate had different plans, as the two ended up falling in love a second time following a chance encounter at David’s Bridal, where they’d each gone to try to return clothes they’d stolen for store credit. After locking eyes near the fitting rooms—Waters in a wedding dress she’d later shoplift and Crunch nude except for a pair of high heels—sparks flew once again, and the pair immediately pounced at each other and engaged in a furious bout of dry-humping that loudly persisted for a good hour before they eventually stopped to go chase after an ambulance they believed was the ice cream truck. “I divorced Cap’n Crunch after becoming increasingly convinced that he was a Muppet, but during our time apart I began realizing that he isn’t really a Muppet at all but rather a small pharaoh of some kind, and I find that very attractive,” said Waters in the statement, adding that she needs to go to the bathroom. “Once he and I reunited, we became nude and smashed our wacky parts together, and then we did make slime in each other. The slime somehow turned into twin babies that are now growing inside of us, which is very scary. We do not want the babies, but we cannot abort them due to something Cap’n Crunch calls the Cap’n’s Code, which forbids modern medicine of all kinds. He came up with the Cap’n’s Code two days ago while sitting on the toilet.” As for Crunch, he describes a different reason for reuniting with Waters. “Maxine Waters has a house, and when I was married to her, she’d let me stay in the house and sleep in one of her dresser drawers,” said Crunch, adding that the house is blue and made of wood and it has a big window that you can look at cars from. “But when we got divorced, I didn’t have anywhere to stay, so I had to go live at the dog pound, and they neutered me there. And while I enjoyed how they let you go to the bathroom outside and how you get to eat your food out of a bowl on the floor, I missed living in a place where I didn’t have to worry about getting my testicles cut off, as that procedure is forbidden under the Cap’n’s Code. So that’s why I decided to get back with Maxine Waters.” The two then concluded their statement by having a heated argument over which one of them has the longest fingernails, seemingly forgetting that other people would be able to read what they were writing.  Truly, this is a love story for the ages! While the couple has yet to officially remarry, they say they plan to do so as soon as they scrape together the $4 million they need to buy all the monster trucks they want for their dream wedding. However, whenever they do tie the knot, it’s sure to be like something straight out of a fairy tale, celebrated by billions around the world just like when they first exchanged vows nearly three decades ago. Congrats to America’s favorite couple on getting back together and making us believe once again in the extraordinary power of love. "
Automotive Breakthrough: The 2022 Toyota Corolla Will Include A Jean Pocket On The Outside Of The Car To Put Your Hand In To Look Casual While Driving,N/A,https://clickhole.com/automotive-breakthrough-the-2022-toyota-corolla-will-include-a-jean-pocket-on-the-outside-of-the-car-to-put-your-hand-in-to-look-casual-while-driving/,"Car lovers, prepare to have your mind blown, because Toyota has unveiled a revolutionary feature that’s bound to change the automotive industry forever: The 2022 Corolla will include a jean pocket on the outside of the car to put your hand in to look casual while driving.  So cool!  In a press release this morning, Toyota revealed that the exterior design of the 2022 Corolla will feature a convenient jean pocket on the driver side door of the sedan, which drivers can reach out the window and tuck their hand into whenever they want to give off a nonchalant vibe to fellow motorists and pedestrians. Available in either blue or black raw denim, the jean pocket will offer an entirely new way to appear laidback on the road, as a teaser ad for the 2022 model depicts supremely mellow-looking Corolla owners hooking their thumbs into the pockets while keeping one hand on the wheel and calmly nodding along to chill lo-fi beats. If there’s any way to project effortlessly cool energy to other people in traffic, this is it! “The 2022 Corolla is unparalleled in what it can offer drivers who want to exude a calm and collected attitude while driving,” said Toyota in a press release. “Whether you feel awkward about keeping your hands occupied while driving, or you just want other motorists to admire your lax approach to navigating traffic, the new jean-pocket-equipped Corolla is the only car on the road that gives you what you need. This is an automotive revolution, and Toyota is leading the way.”  Um, yeah, whoever designed this feature deserves a big raise, and stat. This is a huge breakthrough that’s going to disrupt the entire car industry! Innovations as game-changing as this one don’t come along very often in the car industry, and it’s only a matter of time before other car companies start following suit with exterior jean pockets of their own. Props to Toyota for developing such a simple, effective way to seem easygoing and relaxed on the road. Driving will simply never be the same!"
Thank God: The Penguins In This Kids Movie Just Started A Soul Train To ‘Everybody Dance Now’ Which Means The Movie Will Probably Be Over Soon,N/A,https://clickhole.com/thank-god-the-penguins-in-this-kids-movie-just-started-a-soul-train-to-everybody-dance-now-which-means-the-movie-will-probably-be-over-soon/,"The last two hours have been rough, indeed downright torturous at times, but a recent turn of events may mean that our long-awaited salvation is finally in sight: The penguins in this kids movie just started a soul train to “Everybody Dance Now” which means the movie will probably be over soon. Thank fucking God, we were pretty much at our limit with this thing. Just moments ago, the penguins in this kids movie formed into two parallel lines and began dancing one at a time down the middle to C+C Music Factory’s “Gonna Make You Sweat (Everybody Dance Now),” a sure sign that the seemingly endless barrage of fart jokes and hacky referential humor we’ve been suffering through is finally at its close. As grating as it is to have to watch every last one of these smirking, attitude-heavy penguins doing the Electric Slide or, Christ, fucking flossing down the middle of the Soul Train, the fact that it undeniably means the movie is ending makes it almost a joyful sight. Not joyful in the way the movie might have intended of course, but still, it’s hard to overstate how much better this is making us feel than the scene from earlier in the movie when the sassy rapping Tiffany Haddish penguin performed an utterly unbearable Sir Mix-a-Lot parody called “Baby Got Beak,” or when the cowardly Ed Helms penguin clumsily surfed on a broken-off iceberg shard to escape the jaws of a killer whale while “Wipe Out” blared in the background, or when the penguins did a fashion show to Right Said Fred’s “I’m Too Sexy” and the dorky Josh Gad penguin molted right before taking the runway, leaving him naked and blushing. Additional supporting evidence seems to confirm that this whole “Everybody Dance Now” thing means the movie is on its way out, such as the brief cutaway shot to the movie’s villain—a polar bear played by Liam Neeson who moved to the South Pole so he could eat the penguins—breakdancing while the secret agent sea lions from the awful Mission: Impossible sequence cheer him on. The polar bear and sea lions had not previously interacted in the movie, so the fact that they’re being shown together here without any effort to contextualize it or establish a relationship seems like a very hopeful sign that the movie’s main plot, if you can call it that, is over. Even more encouraging, the polar bear just painfully flubbed a move and coughed up the beloved elder penguin he ate at the beginning of the movie to kick off the whole conflict, who is shown to be perfectly fine and is now doing the Charleston. That’s definitely something you only do if your movie’s essentially over. Not a moment too fucking soon. To be clear, we’re not totally out of the woods yet: The penguins will probably do a bunch of goofy antics around the edge of the screen during the first half of the end credits as a sugary Sia ballad about the importance of being yourself plays. We’re also probably still on the hook for some final post-credits beat where the snooty french chef the penguins locked in a bathroom halfway through the movie comes back for some kind of limp, half-assed brick joke, but that’s probably as bad as it’ll get. Worst-case scenario that’s another ten minutes until we’re finally rid of these fucking penguins, and ten’s really on the outside here. It’s hard to imagine them being able to stretch all that much further than five. Man, really glad to finally be seeing the light at the end of the tunnel. There were times when it felt like this movie would never end, but now that the penguins have formed a Soul Train to “Everybody Dance Now,” we can safely say that this whole ordeal is almost behind us. Time to get a goddamn drink."
"Clearly Deflecting: Kevin Spacey Just Tried To Do His Own #MeToo About Being Groomed By A 9-Foot-Tall, Seemingly Mythical Entity He Calls ‘The Wanderer’",N/A,https://clickhole.com/clearly-deflecting-kevin-spacey-just-tried-to-do-his-own-metoo-about-being-groomed-by-a-9-foot-tall-seemingly-mythical-entity-he-calls-the-wanderer/,"Kevin Spacey has attempted multiple times to draw attention away from the sexual misconduct allegations made against him in 2017, and now the 61-year-old film star seems to be shamelessly trying to co-opt the #MeToo movement to justify his behavior: Spacey just tried to do his own #MeToo about being groomed by a nine-foot-tall, seemingly mythical entity he calls “The Wanderer.” God, Kevin. Just give it up. This is not going to work. Earlier today, Spacey sent out a long, emotional Instagram post that goes into extensive detail about the decades of manipulation and abuse he has suffered at the hands of a towering, faceless, hairless creature that he knows only as The Wanderer. Spacey says he first encountered The Wanderer in the woods of Griffith Park, “dragging his rattling hobo bindle and showing off his tattered cape,” at which point the towering beast began building a rapport with Spacey by giving him piggyback rides and treats as they scampered through the woods together foraging for berries. After this initial encounter, Spacey claims that The Wanderer began showing up at him house almost daily and asking to show him “hundreds of coins,” a behavior which at the time made Spacey feel special, but which he now recognizes as “an insidious form of grooming that The Wanderer used to isolate me from my peers, none of whom had the shining coins The Wanderer sought.” Spacey said he got to a point where he was making all his decisions in life around what would “make The Wanderer smile his ancient, lipless smile,” and that The Wanderer’s daily routine of howling in Spacey’s backyard at dawn constituted an “egregious violation of boundaries” that Spacey accepted as normal when he was younger, thus priming him to accept even more abuse from The Wanderer as time went on. Huh. We’re not totally sure why Kevin Spacey thought this post would generate any sympathy for him, but okay. Even worse, Spacey went on to try to excuse his own inappropriate behavior via his sob story, saying, “If I’ve hurt other people, it might have been because I was reenacting the long-term hurt caused by The Wanderer, who will travel hundreds of miles on foot just to find me and whisper ancient curses into my ear as I try to shop for groceries—a behavior I have tolerated for far too long.” As if that weren’t enough, he added a somber “#MeToo” to the end of his post, implying that his experience with this fucked-up storybook character fits in with the anti-sexual assault movement that he himself was implicated in.  Pretty gross, dude! Your made-up monster story isn’t fooling anyone.  Seriously, though, Spacey needs to quit with this bullshit and stop trying to justify his own heinous actions. This is vile and embarrassing. If, on the off chance, what he’s describing with The Wanderer actually did happen, then we’re sorry, but if not, then fuck off. He should just lay low for a while and stop acting insane, because whatever he’s trying to do now definitely isn’t working."
Not A Great Sign: Every Blurb On This Book Cover Is Clearly Written So As To Carefully Avoid Having To Say The Book Is Good,N/A,https://clickhole.com/not-a-great-sign-every-blurb-on-this-book-cover-is-clearly-written-so-as-to-carefully-avoid-having-to-say-the-book-is-good/,"They say not to judge a book by its cover, but honestly, what we’re reading on the back of this new release is enough to convince us that it absolutely isn’t worth our time: Every blurb on this book cover is clearly written so as to carefully avoid having to say the book is good. Hmm. Not a good sign when the people you specifically recruit to say your book is good won’t even say your book is good.  The book, titled Tales From A Millennial Disaster, is a memoir from 27-year-old Yale graduate and internet writer Andrea Wayne, who, judging by the thoroughly unenthusiastic blurbs about her writing, doesn’t exactly seem like she’s bound for literary superstardom. In fact, all of the blurbs her publisher managed to wrangle seem to be strategically worded so as not to comment on the book’s quality, and instead reference Wayne using neutral, noncommittal language like “a true millennial with the battle scars to prove it.“ and “a sassy bullhorn for a generation raised on the world wide web.” Indeed, it’s hard to get too excited about this book considering that the most prominent blurb on the back cover—from a writer with just a slightly higher profile than Wayne herself—is really just a lukewarm overview of the table of contents, saying, “Andrea Wayne is an Arizona native who takes us from her desert childhood to her adulthood in Brooklyn, folding in coming-of-age anecdotes about the trials and tribulations of dating, working, and generally just existing as a millennial along the way.” Yeah, that doesn’t quite scream “Pulitzer frontrunner.”  You’d think that if the book had anything special going on in the way of voice, insight, sense of humor, or hell, even structure, they’d be able to get somebody to mention that in a blurb, but instead they’re all either bland non-compliments, half-assed jokes that offer no firm opinion, or utterly empty blather that straight-up ignores the book entirely. Somehow, the publisher managed to get a quote from Mindy Kaling—or, more likely, a quote someone else wrote that Kaling signed off on—but it, like the other blurbs, steers clear of actually offering substantive praise, saying, “This is the perfect book to read in the bath, and I love baths. Don’t come between me and my baths!” “Don’t come between me and my baths”? What the hell does that have to do with anything?   Damn. We get that writing and publishing a book isn’t easy, but if these are the most glowing reviews you can get from people literally enlisted to write glowing reviews, then maybe you should consider a new line of work. All signs point to Tales From A Millennial Disaster being an actual disaster, so we think we’re gonna go ahead and skip reading this one. "
America Is Better Than This: These Chairless People Are Being Forced to Fight Over A Constantly Diminishing Supply Of Chairs,N/A,https://clickhole.com/america-is-better-than-this-these-chairless-people-are-being-forced-to-fight-over-a-constantly-diminishing-supply-of-chairs/,"It’s no secret that inequality is growing more and more rampant in every facet of American life. However, if the horrifying injustice you’re about to read about is any indication of where the U.S. is headed, prepare to have your faith in our country shaken to its absolute core: These chairless people are being forced to fight over a constantly diminishing supply of chairs.  Just awful. How can we call ourselves the greatest country in the world when we allow this to happen? The disturbing scene began unfolding moments ago at a child’s birthday party in Boise, Idaho, when what was supposed to be a joyful gathering suddenly descended into a humanitarian nightmare as 12 people were made to march in a circle and frantically battle one another over 11 chairs, then 10 chairs, and then nine, as a heartless overseer cruelly removes them one by one. As unnervingly upbeat music blasts from speakers nearby—stopping and starting without warning, a torture technique designed to induce maximal dread and panic—friends and family members alike have had no choice but to violently push and shove each other for access to a chair or else face expulsion from the group. The sadistic pageant has been unfolding in heartbreakingly Darwinian fashion, with the stronger and faster members of the group having a brutal advantage over the old, young, and weak, several of whom were hip-checked out of a chair despite reaching it first and cast out to watch the inhumane proceedings continue from a laughing, jeering audience of spectators.  As the number of participants in this sick experiment continues to whittle down, competition for the precious few remaining chairs is becoming more intense and depraved, with the fear growing palpable among the finalists, who now have no choice but to sabotage and outmuscle their friends simply to preserve their basic human right to a place to sit down. Yet, sadly, the trauma they’re all enduring to outlast one another will certainly outweigh any satisfaction that comes with being the so-called “victor,” as what joy is there in winning if you must forsake those you love to do so?   Horrific. No one should ever have to endure something like this.  Forcing people to fight one another for chairs is something you might expect to see in a barbaric rogue nation, but not in the U.S.. Hopefully this will serve as a serious wakeup call to all Americans as to just how far we’ve drifted from our values, because this is not who we are. America is better than this, but we won’t be for long if we allow things like this to happen."
Incredible Achievement: Mom Has Become The World’s Slowest Solver Of Something She Calls ‘Sudoka’,N/A,https://clickhole.com/incredible-achievement-mom-has-become-the-worlds-slowest-solver-of-something-she-calls-sudoka/,"You might have thought that Mom has achieved just about everything she’s going to achieve in life, but she just did something absolutely amazing that shows she is far from done: Mom has become the world’s slowest solver of something she calls “sudoka.” Cool! Way to go, Mom! Ever since she downloaded an app from Sudoku.com on her friend Linda’s recommendation last week, Mom has made a name for herself as the popular puzzle game’s slowest living solver. Over the weekend, Mom spent three straight evenings on the couch staring dumbly at her iPad through her reading glasses and periodically mumbling “Wait, how did that get there?” as she struggled to complete her very first beginner-level puzzle, filling up numerous pages of scrap paper with calculations despite the fact that there is no addition or subtraction involved in Sudoku. Following this initial taste of success, Mom was immediately hungry for more, and she’s since cleared her iPad’s home screen of everything besides what she calls “my Sudoka game”. Already, she’s facing plenty of obstacles in this endeavor, including Dad watching baseball incredibly loudly on TV every day, which she says makes her “type the wrong numbers,” but despite the challenges, she’s remaining determined to keep up her mind-blowingly slow pace of filling in one Sudoku box per hour for a week straight. There have been times that Mom has nearly given up on Sudoku, saying things like “I don’t see how they expect me to know if this should be a seven,” presumably using “they” to refer to the algorithm that auto-generates the Sudoku boards on her app. But she seems to have a fiery inner drive to establish herself as the worst Sudoku player in history, forging onward even when a particularly tricky Sudoku causes her to sigh, look up from her iPad, and say “This stupid thing doesn’t make any sense.” It’s true that solving puzzles like these can help maintain cognitive function as a person ages, but probably not the way Mom’s doing it, since she uses the app’s hint function just about every turn and is also constantly asking everyone in the family to give their “opinion” on which numbers should go where, effectively outsourcing all the heavy lifting to those around her. Wow! It just goes to show that, if you set your mind to it, it’s never too late in life to become really bad at something.  We really have to hand it to Mom for having the passion and determination to wake up every day and solve Sudoku puzzles at what can only be described as a glacially slow pace. As far as being shitty at Sudoku goes, she is truly on pace to smash all-time records, and we could not be more proud. Amazing job, Mom! It’s awesome that you have a nice activity now to help pass the time as you navigate your slow, inescapable descent into senility. "
"A Piece Of History: The Riding Mower That Whoopi Goldberg, John Denver, and Dobby Used To Escape New York After The 9/11 Attacks Is Coming To The Smithsonian",N/A,https://clickhole.com/a-piece-of-history-the-riding-mower-that-whoopi-goldberg-john-denver-and-dobby-used-to-escape-new-york-after-the-9-11-attacks-is-coming-to-the-smithsonian/,"The events of September 11th, 2001 remain some of the darkest in American history, and now, for the first time ever, an important artifact from that tragic day will be available for public viewing: The riding mower that Whoopi Goldberg, John Denver, and Dobby used to escape New York after the 9/11 attacks is coming to The Smithsonian. The National Museum Of American History announced today that, ahead of the 20th anniversary of the attacks, they’ll be adding a new exhibit which will allow viewers to experience for themselves the infamous trip taken by these three celebrities as they ventured out of New York City toward safety. Upon arriving, visitors will begin their tour of the exhibit by listening to a recording of the three-way call placed by Goldberg to her best friends Denver and Dobby as soon as she heard that the first tower fell in which she frantically yells, “A Black woman, an elf, and a hick? We’re gonna be next! We gotta scram!” And scram they did: The exhibit’s main attraction is the John Deere mower used for the trio’s getaway that Dobby stole from the Central Park groundskeepers shed where he’d been illegally squatting after getting booted from the apartment he shared with comedian Rob Riggle due to his poor hygiene. Viewers will recognize the dent on the side of the mower from when it slammed against a guardrail on the George Washington Bridge as Dobby reached for the wheel to try to turn the mower around, crying, “Dobby wants to fight! Dobby wants to go back and wage holy war!” To this day, historians agree that it’s never been clear which side Dobby intended to help. An interactive map will give viewers the chance to explore all the iconic stops made by the group, such as the mailbox where Goldberg mailed a letter to Homeland Security to tell them that she was 70 percent sure that the villain from Sister Act is the one who “did today’s plane stuff,” as well as the payphone where Denver called his mother to tell her that he died in 9/11. More fascinating still, when visitors click on the stretch of I-95 outside East Windsor, NJ on the map, they’ll be able to listen to an incredible audio recreation of the moment where the trio enjoyed a brief respite from the fear and panic that otherwise colored the day to indulge in a rousing sing-a-long led by Denver to his hit tune “Thank God I’m A Country Boy,” with Goldberg and Dobby both singing the lyrics to “Jesus Loves The Little Children” since they didn’t know the real words.   At the conclusion of the exhibit, guests can check out the never-before-released security footage from the trio’s final stop at Six Flags Great Adventure, where they snuck into the Wild Safari Drive-Thru at Goldberg’s insistence that they take two of each animal with them in order to “start a new life in the promised land.” By this point in the trip, tensions had clearly risen to the surface, as the footage depicts Denver yelling at Dobby, “They should’ve flown the planes into you!” as they tried to lure a giraffe into a bumper car they’d attached to the back of the riding mower before they were apprehended by Six Flags officers and taken to the jail cell where they all remain to this day. Absolutely incredible. This exhibit is sure to be an emotional one, but this is a once in a lifetime chance to see some amazing American relics up close. This is definitely an exhibit you won’t want to miss!"
Heartbreaking: This Overweight Boy Is Too Self-Conscious To Take His Shirt Off At A Masked Orgy,N/A,https://clickhole.com/heartbreaking-this-overweight-boy-is-too-self-conscious-to-take-his-shirt-off-at-a-masked-orgy/,"To see a child struggling with their own body image is absolutely heartbreaking. While our society has made huge strides in embracing body positivity, here’s a devastating example of how far we still have to go: This overweight boy is too self-conscious to take his shirt off at a masked orgy. Ugh, poor guy. We wish we could give this kid a hug right now.  A terribly sad scene is currently unfolding at a secluded mansion estate in Greenwich, CT, where dozens of wealthy elite and 6th grader Dylan Halford have gathered to participate in a masked orgy, complete with erotic pagan rituals and rhythmic chanting. While guests indulge in group sex wearing nothing but Venetian masks, Dylan remains the only orgy member who is still wearing a shirt. The poor kid, afraid of being ridiculed for his weight, was seen nervously adjusting his XXL Hard Rock Cafe souvenir tee to hide his love handles as he lingered nervously near a tangled mass of limbs engaging in depraved acts on an antique Louis XV chaise lounge. Even though Dylan’s bejewelled bauta mask obscures his true identity from all his anonymous sex partners, he’s still too sensitive about his husky frame to go shirtless at this bacchanalia, worried that some of the other attendees might laugh at him or call him names like “tater tits” or “Shamu Jr.” In fact, when the orgy’s Master Of Ceremonies asked Dylan why he had a shirt on, Dylan bashfully made up an excuse about having poison ivy on his stomach, and his mom said he needed to keep it covered until it cleared up. It’s such a shame that Dylan feels so intimidated by the more conventional body types living out unrestrained sexual fantasies on every surface throughout this secret society’s private country manor. He deserves to experience as much carnal pleasure as anyone else at this orgy, no matter how much larger he is than the average 12-year-old. In a less fatphobic world, Dylan would feel comfortable enough to take off his shirt and participate in a Daisy Chain without fear of being judged for his obesity. Tragically, kids like Dylan have deeply internalized their imperfections, to the point that he can’t enjoy spanking a row of nude, prostrate subs with a riding crop without feeling anxious about his weight.  God, this is so sad. Our heart goes out to Dylan.  Hopefully Dylan will one day come to embrace his body type and feel comfortable in his own skin at mass orgies. The sight of Dylan wearing a t-shirt surrounded by nearly a hundred naked, glistening bodies of global elites serves as a reminder of how important it is to teach kids that they are beautiful and loved no matter what they look like."
Exploring Other Cultures: This Woman Pressed Some Keys Incorrectly And Made What Seems To Be The Letter ‘W’ In Greek Or Russian Appear,N/A,https://clickhole.com/exploring-other-cultures-this-woman-pressed-some-keys-incorrectly-and-made-what-seems-to-be-the-letter-w-in-greek-or-russian-appear/,"The world is a diverse and extraordinary place full of exciting possibilities, and here’s a story that shows the incredible experiences that await you if you’re willing to expand your horizons: This woman pressed some keys incorrectly and made what seems to be the letter “W” in Greek or Russian appear. Wow! What a strange yet beautiful look into another culture! Earlier today, 34-year-old data analyst Angela Ferris was transported to a whole new world when she accidentally hit a few incorrect keys while working on a sales report and somehow made this thing appear: “Ш”. Angela’s curiosity and wanderlust was instantly piqued by the foreign character, which she guessed to be the letter “W” in Greek, Russian, or possibly even something she thought of called “Greco-Russian,” opening the door for her to Google both languages and digitally travel to the countries where they’re spoken.  As Angela stared at the letter, she was utterly captivated by the differences between the “W” with a pointy bottom that she’d grown up with and this intriguing new flat-bottomed “W.” She nodded her head in silent appreciation for how, as far as she can tell, pretty much every culture has their own version of a “W,” some versions of which probably don’t even make the classic “W” sound that we use in English but rather something more exotic and breathy—she didn’t bother looking this up to be sure, but you gotta figure it’s true. Angela also took a few moments to ponder whether the “W” on her computer screen was one of those special letters they use in math, like that big Greek “E” she remembered seeing in either high school calculus or geometry, but she also did not bother looking this up. She instead deleted the fascinating “W” and carried on with her work.   Amazing! Kudos to Angela for taking some time out of her busy day to explore a new culture and see the world through an unfamiliar lens. Here’s hoping her example inspires others to get out and celebrate our differences, as there is a vast and wonderful world out there ready to be explored."
‘Talk Smack With Your Friends Instead’: This Amazing New Anti-Bullying Campaign Reminds Kids That Talking Shit Behind Someone’s Back Is A Safe And Effective Alternative To Bullying,N/A,https://clickhole.com/talk-smack-with-your-friends-instead-this-amazing-new-anti-bullying-campaign-reminds-kids-that-talking-shit-behind-someones-back-is-a-safe-and-effective-alternative-to-bull/,"Bullying in the U.S. is a serious issue that affects millions of kids per year, but that may soon change, as here’s a story of an awesome organization with a practical solution that could end bullying once and for all: This amazing new anti-bullying campaign reminds kids that talking shit behind someone’s back is a safe and effective alternative to bullying. Incredible! This is going to prevent so many kids from hearing the awful things people are saying about them. Launched by the Ad Council earlier this week, the forward-thinking campaign seeks to illustrate the benefits of merely talking smack about someone without saying it directly to their face, allowing kids to still have fun while not hurting anyone’s feelings. To help get this message across, the Ad Council has partnered with pop singer Dua Lipa, who stars in a powerful new spot as a popular high schooler who, upon seeing a nerdy classmate in a trenchcoat rushing down the hallway with a briefcase instead of a backpack, impressively resists the very understandable urge to humiliate him in front of his peers.  “Yes, this kid is a huge loser, and yes, it would be fun to publicly roast him for having bad acne or for coming from a broken home, but the unfortunate reality is that you might get in trouble if you do that,” says Dua Lipa in the ad. “But the good news is that you can still talk shit about him without hurting his feelings—all you gotta do is make fun of him behind his back! It’s still fun for you, and he’ll be none the wiser. Now THAT’S a new rule!”  Dua Lipa then joins a group of gossipping teen girls and begins mimicking the trenchcoat kid’s spastic gait while he, oblivious to the mockery, happily sprints off to anime club. A title card then appears on screen that says, “JUST TALK SHIT WITH YOUR FRIENDS INSTEAD.”       So powerful. As if that commercial wasn’t already going to make a major difference in curbing bullying in schools, the campaign also features a series of billboard ads that emphasize why secretly talking shit is preferable to bullying. One thought-provoking billboard says, “Want to tell someone they’re a fugly ho? Tell your friends instead,” followed by smaller text that reads, “Talk smack behind their back to end bullying for good.” Other billboards feature testimonials from real high school students in which they describe instances where they became closer with their friends because of an inside joke that’s solely based on insulting one of their fellow classmates, proving that not only is talking shit behind someone’s back better for the person who would’ve been bullied, but it also makes existing friendships even stronger. Wow! Here’s hoping that as many people as possible see this campaign, because it’s definitely going to save kids from the pain of being bullied to their face. "
Not So Impressive Anymore: Archeologists Have Discovered That The Sphinx Was Supposed To Be A Soccer Ball,N/A,https://clickhole.com/not-so-impressive-anymore-archeologists-have-discovered-that-the-sphinx-was-supposed-to-be-a-soccer-ball/,"Prepare yourself for a letdown of historical proportions, because a new revelation has taken the shine off of one of the most well-known icons of antiquity: Archaeologists have discovered that the Sphinx was supposed to be a soccer ball. Woof, really? No offense to the ancient Egyptians, but sounds like they were actually huge dumbasses.  The shocking failure came to light earlier this week when a dig at the Giza Plateau unearthed a number of carved tablets appearing to depict the attempted construction of a small, not particularly complicated soccer ball. Further digging, however, revealed more tablets recording numerous boneheaded mistakes and miscalculations during the building process, such as a typo changing the word for “rubber” to “stone,” causing the soccer ball to grow ever larger and more unwieldy to the Egyptians’ increasing exasperation. A final tablet bearing hieroglyphics roughly translating to “Cutting our losses; Guess we’ll just play soccer with this” shows an unmistakable representation of the towering Sphinx statue, conclusively proving that the Sphinx is not a staggering wonder of ancient architecture, but rather the laughably pathetic result of an abortive attempt to play sports. Subsequent digging around the Sphinx statue itself has reinforced this new line of thought by revealing a pair of goalposts at the eastern and western ends of the Sphinx, which despite being regulation size are still several orders of magnitude too small for any parts of the Sphinx to conceivably fit through. The archaeologists have also excavated several mass burial sites nearby containing thousands of skeletons with smashed skulls and leg bones, suggesting that the deaths of laborers during construction of the Sphinx paled in comparison to the deaths of those who tried to play soccer with it afterwards. It would be one thing to die in the construction of a monument meant to be so magnificent as to defy death itself, but dying because you screwed up making a soccer ball has got to be one of the more undignified ways to go. “We had always assumed it was supposed to be a temple or a funerary monument of some kind, but apparently that was way too charitable because the whole thing was only ever supposed to be a small, bouncy ball for people to kick around,” said Dr. Simone Hasselbeck, the lead archeologist behind this game-changing discovery. “Now that we know its intended function, we can see that the damage to the Sphinx’s face we had previously attributed to weathering and vandalism was more likely the result of these morons trying to do bicycle kicks in a futile effort to score a goal with this thing. I don’t know the first thing about how to make a soccer ball but I could definitely get closer than these idiots did, and I wouldn’t even have to spend a whole damn century of forced labor to do it.” Yeesh. This is a pretty devastating L for the ancient Egyptians. In retrospect, it’s embarrassing that we used to be genuinely awestruck by this big, stupid lion-shaped rock. Even if that’s what they were intending to build, it’d still be a useless, ill-conceived structure, and it makes sense that no other cultures have felt the need to build stadium-sized rock monsters of their own. If there’s any takeaway here, it’s that the ancient Egyptians may very well have been the dumbest humans to ever walk the earth."
Teaching Respect: The Jim Henson Company Has Replaced Miss Piggy With A Nonviolent Pig That Just Wants To Suck Kermit Off,N/A,https://clickhole.com/teaching-respect-the-jim-henson-company-has-replaced-miss-piggy-with-a-non-violent-pig-that-just-wants-to-suck-kermit-off/,"After over 45 years of delighting audiences worldwide, it appears that the curtains are closing on one of the most iconic characters in television history: The Jim Henson Company has replaced Miss Piggy with a nonviolent pig that just wants to suck Kermit off. Wow. This is truly the end of an era.  In a statement released earlier today, the Jim Henson Company confirmed that Miss Piggy’s famously violent antics no longer align with the company’s evolving values, and moving forward she’ll be replaced in the Muppet gang by a much more peaceful pig named Miss Barbara, who will eschew the constant fist-fighting that Miss Piggy brought to the table yet preserve her trademark desire to pleasure Kermit the Frog.  “After much reflection, we’ve decided that it would be irresponsible to continue promoting a character like Miss Piggy who uses violence to solve problems, which is why we’re introducing Miss Barbara, a strong female pig character with an insatiable desire to suck on Kermit forever, who doesn’t take out her anger through punches and kicks but instead channels her emotions productively through the act of fellatio,” said the Jim Henson Company’s statement. “Miss Barbara, like Miss Piggy, is obsessively attracted to Kermit because he is one of the rare few fully nude Muppets and thus one of the most sexual by default—but unlike her predecessor, she never resorts to violent behavior, and instead focuses all her energy on getting her lips around Kermit’s penis.” In conjunction with the announcement, the Jim Henson Company released a short teaser video giving fans a sneak peek of the new character. In it, we see Miss Barbara—similarly proportioned to Miss Piggy but with bright red puckered lips and a T-shirt that reads “Hello, Let’s Suck Each Other Off”—prowling around the backstage area of The Muppet Show and muttering “Where’s that weird boy I’m always sucking on?” under her breath while frantically searching for Kermit, stomping her hooves with anticipation.  At one point, Miss Barbara stops Fozzie and asks, “Excuse me, marmot, do you know where my sex crush is? He is green and has a little cone that tastes like lake water and cumin when you suck on it.” Fozzie then discreetly points over towards the wall, where we see Kermit grinning sheepishly and trying to not be noticed, at which point Miss Lady charges eagerly towards him, wide-eyed and guppy-mouthed, yelling, “There you are! Let me get a look at that little prong of yours! Come over here and make WWII in my mouth!” The trailer then cuts to a shot of Miss Barbara convulsing merrily with her face in Kermit’s lap while Kermit hollers and flails his arms in wide arcs. As this is happening, we see a dozen other Muppets looking on from hiding places in the background, including a frightened Beaker, who is shrieking because he does not understand what’s happening, and Rowlf, who is marveling to Gonzo over the spirited manner in which she is “snarfing on his cone.”  This is awesome. We’re so glad to see The Muppet Show finally introduce a sexual pig character who proves that you don’t have to be violent to be entertaining. Clearly, the message the Jim Henson Company is sending with this new character is that hitting people is wrong but sucking off animals is generally fine, and we could not agree more. And while it’ll be sad to no longer see Miss Piggy, it’ll be great to have a new Muppet who is just as sassy and glamorous and cock-crazed as she is, but isn’t constantly doing karate attacks on her pals. It’s Miss Barbara’s time to shine!"
Get The Telescopes Ready: NASA Announced That This Friday Is The MILF Moon,N/A,https://clickhole.com/get-the-telescopes-ready-nasa-announced-that-this-friday-is-the-milf-moon/,"If you’ve got a teenage boy at home, listen up, because there’s an astronomical event happening soon that’s going to have your son going wild: NASA has announced that this Friday is the MILF moon. Looks like it’s time to dust off the old telescope, set it up by the window in your son’s room, and leave them be! Earlier today, NASA announced that the rare MILF moon will be appearing in the night sky this Friday, an extraordinary lunar stage that only happens once every 52 years. The agency projects that visibility of the MILF moon will be clearest in areas with high concentrations of adolescent horniness, such as the jacuzzis at Great Wolf Lodge resorts and pretty much anywhere in Daytona Beach.  “Beginning early Friday evening, a vague scent of cigarette smoke, spilled beer, and Victoria’s Secret Love Spell will waft through the air, followed by the gentle clacking sound of long fake nails, alerting teenage boys to the fact that the MILF moon is about to rise,” said NASA in a press release. “Throughout the duration of this lunar event, we can expect teenage boys to be giddily high-fiving each other for hours on end as they gawk at the MILF moon and exchange off-color comments about wanting to ‘tap that.’”  “We highly recommend that parents do not walk in on their sons at any point during the night and interrupt their viewing of the MILF moon, because it would surely be awkward for both of you,” the agency added. “The next time this moon happens again, your boys will be well into their 60s and far less hormonal, so it’s best that you just let them savor this one now.”  Fascinating! It sounds like this has the potential to be one of the horniest lunar events of the century, so if you’re a 16-year-old in the throes of puberty, get ready to go crazy with lust. Eyes to the sky, boys! This is going to be the hottest moon ever."
Drunk With Power: This Crossing Guard Is Attempting To Stop An Ambulance That’s Going 70 With Its Siren Wailing And Everything,N/A,https://clickhole.com/drunk-with-power-this-crossing-guard-is-attempting-to-stop-an-ambulance-thats-going-70-with-its-siren-wailing-and-everything/,"Power can be intoxicating, and occasionally, it can drive those who wield it too far. Case in point: This crossing guard is currently trying to stop an oncoming ambulance that probably has someone dying in it because it’s totally flying down the road with its lights flashing and siren blaring full blast.  Yikes. He’s gone mad with power!  Bug-eyed with veins popping out of his forehead, this crossing guard at a busy intersection in Houston clearly takes his role way, way too seriously, as even though all the pedestrians at the crosswalk seem content to wait on the sidewalk until the rapidly approaching ambulance passes, the neon-vested traffic sentinel is nonetheless standing firm in the middle of the intersection, waving his stop sign and loudly blowing his whistle in an effort to halt the speeding emergency vehicle in its tracks. Though obstructing ambulances from getting to hospitals is almost certainly not one of his official job duties, this no-nonsense traffic guard seems to be ‘roided up on the awesomeness of his own authority and willing to do whatever it takes, no matter how reckless, to ensure the safe passage of pedestrians. Despite the crossing guard’s bold, unyielding presence, the ambulance is barreling towards him at 70 mph and showing no signs of slowing down, creating a high-stakes, highly unnecessary game of chicken. And while the crossing guard’s only real responsibility is to keep people from getting hit by vehicles, he is nonetheless putting himself at serious risk of getting hit by a vehicle at this very moment, conducting himself like some kind of supreme, all-powerful god of thoroughfares who, by merit of having a reflective hi-vis vest and getting paid $11 an hour, is wholly above the laws of man.   Hmm. Not sure what his deal is. Perhaps he’s trying to establish himself as some kind of irreplaceable force for good in order to stave off the ever-looming threat of being replaced by a crossing signal—a fate that has befallen so many of his brethren in recent generations as more and more cities realize that a flashing orange hand can do the job just as effectively as a human and for no pay. Whatever he’s trying to prove, blowing a whistle at an oncoming ambulance is probably not the most effective way to get his message across.  Seriously, guy, just calm the fuck down. Here’s hoping that this crossing guard gets out of the road ASAP, or that the ambulance at least swerves to avoid obliterating him. This just isn’t something that people want crossing guards to do for them, and if this guy doesn’t realize that soon, he and his stop sign paddle could very well meet an early grave."
You Never Know What Someone’s Going Through: John Candy Just Revealed That He Died In 1994,N/A,https://clickhole.com/you-never-know-what-someones-going-through-john-candy-just-revealed-that-he-died-in-1994/,"Sometimes the people who bring us the most joy are the ones hiding the most pain, and a beloved Canadian funnyman just came clean about a struggle he’s kept secret for decades: John Candy has revealed that he died in 1994. Wow. We would have never guessed he was going through something like this. The Planes, Trains, and Automobiles star shocked the world earlier today when he opened up for the first time about his condition in a heartfelt Instagram post: “There’s something I’ve been keeping quiet about for a long time, and I feel that my wonderful friends and supporters deserve to finally know the truth: In March of 1994, I was found dead of a heart attack while filming in Mexico. The experience changed everything for me, but the one thing I should never have let it change is my belief in being open about the struggles we all go through. The warmth and generosity of my fans has been a constant source of strength for me during my death, so after 27 long years I’m finally ready to repay that kindness with honesty: My name is John Candy, I died, and I am not ashamed of it.” Powerful. It takes real courage to say something like that.  Candy’s forthright confession answers some long-standing questions fans had about his sudden disappearance from films—now that we know he’s been dead since 1994, it makes perfect sense that he only had the energy to star in Wagons East and Canadian Bacon during the ordeal. For many, it’s been a serious shock to learn that the real John Candy could be so different from the happy-go-lucky John Candy they see on the screen, but it just goes to show that people aren’t just who they appear to be on the surface, and sometimes they’re dealing with a lot more than they might let on. People from all across the internet have responded to Candy’s post with an outpouring of support and solidarity, including messages from many fellow comedy greats, like filmmaker John Hughes, who revealed a similar struggle: “So proud to have known an incredible comedian and human being like you, John, and grateful that you’ve given me the courage to say that I died myself in 2009. #IAmAlsoDead,” tweeted the Uncle Buck director.  Three-time Oscar winner Jack Nicholson also voiced his support: “John Candy was the best to ever do it and a class act. Right there with you, brother! #IAmAlsoDead,” tweeted Nicholson. It’s things like this that remind us that there’s always more to people than what meets the eye and that even world-famous celebrities face the same challenges as everyone else. We wish John Candy all the best as he continues his journey of having died 27 years ago."
"What The Fuck, Stay In Your Lane: The Gym Teacher Just Assigned Homework",N/A,https://clickhole.com/what-the-fuck-stay-in-your-lane-the-gym-teacher-just-assigned-homework/,"We all have a purpose to play in this world, each of us a cog in the machine that makes the universe tick, and understanding one’s unique place in the greater whole is essential to creating a harmonious environment for ourselves and others. Unfortunately, though, there will always be those who diverge from their roles and in the process throw delicate ecosystems into total disarray. Case in point: This gym teacher just assigned homework. What the hell, man? Stay in your fucking lane.   Until minutes ago, everything was par for the course in fourth-period gym class at Unami Middle School in Chalfont, PA. The students arrived and uncomfortably sat on the hardwood floor of the basketball gym as Mr. Reese, the bald-headed, goatee-sporting P.E. teacher, took attendance and led everyone through the slow, sitting-on-the-floor stretches that kick off every class. From there, Mr. Reese shepherded the kids outside to the tennis courts, where they each grabbed a super bent and shitty racquet from the large plastic trash can the school uses to store sports equipment and began a run-of-the-mill tennis unit class, which basically just entails the 8th graders all goofing around and spiking balls at each other and no one playing any actual tennis because no one knows how. The class carried on like this until the last five minutes of the period, at which point things took an alarming turn. Standing at the court exit, Mr. Reese handed out worksheets and explained that the health and wellness unit would begin Thursday, and as a homework assignment, everyone would have to log everything they ate for one full day to highlight areas where their diets could improve. Yo, what? This guy can’t be serious!  It wouldn’t be entirely off-base to assume Mr. Reese came to school drunk or a little zonked on pills or something, because the dude is making zero fucking sense right now. Like, did the guy forget he’s a gym teacher? Gym teachers obviously don’t assign homework. In fact, until now, it wasn’t even clear that gym teachers had access to the school’s paper and printers. Their roles are incredibly straightforward: Gym teachers wear shiny athletic pants that make swooshing sounds when they walk, they coach the school’s baseball team and treat all the baseball kids slightly better than normal students, they’re kind of in-shape in a heavyset sort of way, and 80 percent of their day is putting different kinds of balls into mesh bags with pull-strings and then lugging those bags to and from the athletic shed. Nowhere in the job description is there anything about homework, because it just isn’t supposed to happen. It’s just utterly absurd to treat gym class as a place for learning. You gotta wonder where the hell Mr. Reese got the idea that this would be an acceptable thing to do. Like, is the guy trying to prove something? Given that he is somewhere around 50-ish, it is possible that he’s having some sort of midlife crisis over the fact that he’s essentially a weird old camp counselor with no real unique skills or expertise, who’s clearly not performing his job effectively considering that, like, 80 percent of his students are obese. Maybe he’s trying to compensate or make himself feel like he’s a real adult with a real job by handling paperwork for once? Or maybe he caught Dead Poets Society on AMC recently and is suddenly all bought-in on being a legit educator? Or maybe it’s just some state-required thing that he has to do to get funding? Whatever the case, there’s no question that Mr. Reese is stepping way out of line, and he doesn’t realize that a gym teacher assigning homework is about as fucked up as the lunch lady asking for a book report. Unreal.  On the bright side, it’s nice to know that none of Mr. Reese’s students will actually complete the worksheet correctly and will 100 percent just fill in a bunch of made-up answers seconds before the next gym class begins. But nonetheless, here’s hoping that Mr. Reese gets his head on straight and remembers his fucking place in the world."
Humiliating: This Adult Man Is Following Behind An Employee Who Has To Unlock His Video Game For Him With A Little Key,N/A,https://clickhole.com/humiliating-this-adult-man-is-following-behind-an-employee-who-has-to-unlock-his-video-game-for-him-with-a-little-key/,"Get ready to feel uncomfortable, because a deeply humiliating scene is currently unfolding at a Target in Bay Ridge, NY: This adult man is following behind an employee who has to unlock his video game for him with a little key. God, just brutal. Games are already expensive enough as it is without the added cost of your dignity.  Forty-three-year-old Michael Scannel, a middle-aged financial advisor with a mortgage and many adult responsibilities, is currently trailing a teenage Target employee to a locked glass case containing copies of Mass Effect Legendary Edition so that he, a respected business professional, can pay $60 for a game that will let him make-believe he is a space commander having intergalactic battles with cartoon aliens. While Michael was hoping he could just quickly grab the game and go, unfortunately that was not in the cards for him, as the first employee he approached for help did not have the key to the video game case, requiring them to loudly buzz a coworker on a walkie talkie for additional assistance, creating a small—yet hugely embarrassing—scene in which a second employee was forced to stop what they were doing and go out of their way to accompany a man 20 years his senior to the video games section, where the only other customers were a mother and her six-year-old son, with the mother looking to buy an Animal Crossing game for her child, as she, being a grown-up, was of course not seeking such childish entertainment for herself.    Oof. Talk about a walk of shame. And unfortunately for Michael, it looks like the nightmare is just beginning.  After sheepishly following the employee halfway across the store, passing about a dozen other grownup shoppers buying more age-appropriate products along the way, Michael and the helper have finally arrived at the video game case, where Michael must now wait awkwardly next to a giant cardboard cutout of Yoshi and stare at his own balding reflection in the case’s polished glass while the Target employee tries to find the correct key on his lanyard and makes smalltalk about how he used to love the Mass Effect games back in middle school but has since moved on from them, making Michael simultaneously feel very old and very dumb, and rightly so. This is almost unbearably cringeworthy. Poor guy. For a grown-ass man, there aren’t many things more humiliating than having to walk in lockstep behind a Target employee like a helpless duckling so you can get a video game. But sadly for Michael, it’s likely that things will only get worse for him once he gets home and turns on the game, as he’ll almost certainly be subjected to endless taunting and ass-kickings from the middle school-aged children he encounters in the game’s online multiplayer mode, who will mercilessly roast him again and again and again until he eventually just throws in the towel and moves on to more grownup pursuits. Hang in there, Michael. We feel for you. "
Mansplaining At Its Worst: This Man Is Lecturing His Date About The Postmodern Themes In Don DeLillo’s Work As If She Isn’t Don DeLillo In Disguise,N/A,https://clickhole.com/mansplaining-at-its-worst-this-man-is-lecturing-his-date-about-the-postmodern-themes-in-don-delillos-work-as-if-she-isnt-don-delillo-in-disguise/,"You’d think that by 2021, annoying literary bros would have gotten the message that no one wants to hear them mansplain books, but unfortunately, it seems like some of them are still struggling with self-awareness: This man is lecturing his date about the postmodern themes in Don DeLillo’s work as if she isn’t Don DeLillo in disguise. God, this is hard to watch. Mansplaining is never a good look, dude! For over 30 minutes now, Brooklyn resident Joe Shiftlet has been obnoxiously monologuing to his date about the contemporary existential uncertainty pervading Don DeLillo’s White Noise despite the fact that his date is Don DeLillo himself wearing a long blonde wig covered by a pink bedazzled newsboy cap. The pair met up for lunch today following three weeks of chatting back and forth on a dating app, during which DeLillo claimed to be a woman named Donette with pinup model looks and a bio that read “I love to swim” in order to catfish his unsuspecting rube, and immediately upon being seated, Shiftlet launched into a long, insufferable explanation about his college thesis, which focused on the evolving treatment of technology in Don DeLillo’s work over the course of his decades-long career. And, maddeningly, even though Shiftlet’s date is secretly the 84-year-old man who literally wrote every word that he is condescendingly explaining to her, all she can do is nod along and resist rolling her eyes so as not to blow her cover.  It’s honestly sexist for Shiftlet to assume that just because his date told him she was a college senior at Pace University studying marketing that she hasn’t been a central figure in the American literary scene since the 1980s, having spent years at her desk honing her approach to social critique in the contemporary American novel. But Shiftlet seems totally clueless to just how pigheaded he’s being, and now he is telling his date that she “really ought to give Mao II a shot,” while she sits there fiddling with her “Donette” nameplate necklace knowing full well that not only has she read Mao II, but she was also a Pulitzer Prize finalist in 1992 for writing it. It’s so unfair that an aging Italian-American novelist of worldwide repute has to sit through this arrogant lecture after having spent all morning sitting at the kitchen table while her wife Barbara Bennett helped curl her wig with hot rollers. But mansplainers are truly relentless, and Shiftlet has found a way to make the entire situation about him and his expertise on Don DeLillo, a topic he can’t seem to imagine his date would know anything about. Jesus, dude, pull your head out of your ass! You’re not the only person who’s read Don DeLillo’s books. What an embarrassing scene. Shiftlet needs to learn that no one wants to be lectured about American literature, especially on a first date—and especially if your date happens to be Don DeLillo in disguise! Give it a rest, buddy. You’re making a fool of yourself."
Silver Lining: This 5th Grader Whose Parents Just Got Divorced Is Absolutely Crushing The Poetry Unit,N/A,https://clickhole.com/silver-lining-this-5th-grader-whose-parents-just-got-divorced-is-absolutely-crushing-the-poetry-unit/,"There are few life events more painful for a child than their mom and dad splitting up, but fortunately, such a tragic event can sometimes have an upside: this 5th grader whose parents just got divorced is absolutely crushing the poetry unit. Hell yeah! It may be a bad situation, but it’s also had some amazing results. Spring Hill Elementary School fifth grader Ethan Long was devastated when his parents separated early in the school year, but now that the poetry unit in English class has rolled around, he’s straight up killing it with poem after emotional poem about living in a broken home. Whereas most students wrote their first four-stanza assignment about stuff like basketball or their family dog, Ethan had everybody’s jaws on the floor with a poem called “Rearview Mirror,” where he rhymed “During road trips we were always together,” with “Now I just wish they had lasted forever.” As wrenching as the divorce has been, it seems to have given Ethan the exquisite sensitivity of a young Keats, as evidenced by his poem’s thoughtful meditation on how “family” begins with an F, but so do “fractured” and “far apart.” When Ethan read his poem aloud for the class, Ms. Garcia didn’t even give him any critiques or edit his word choice at all like she did with Branson, who went before Ethan and read what was basically just one long sentence about how his little sister is annoying. Instead, she just said “Thank you so much for that, Ethan,” and everybody clapped. Damn! Ethan’s parents’ divorce is really helping him out right now. The only kid in class who’s come even close to touching Ethan is Julie, who wrote a poem called “The Last Goodbye” about her grandma dying, but even she couldn’t top what Ethan came up with in the metaphor lesson, when he wrote a haiku about a shattered picture frame that represented his parents’ broken relationship, which can never be put back together again. All the nights Ethan had to watch his parents fighting in the living room really paid off at the final end-of-unit poetry slam, where half the kids shared the same bullshit about how graduating elementary school would be like closing a chapter in a book, and Ethan blew them all out of the water with a masterwork called “Family Talk” that was written entirely in dialogue between his parents as they sat him down and explained why they could no longer be together. At this point, he’s gotta be thanking God that his parents don’t love each other anymore, because that poem was powerful as hell and earned him an A+ for the entire quarter. Divorce is hard, but it can have some amazing benefits, as evidenced by Ethan’s major success in the four-week poetry unit. There’s a silver lining to every cloud! Way to go, Ethan!"
