Democrats Respond To Jacksonville Shooting With Proposal To Remove Black People From Circulation,N/A,https://www.theonion.com/democrats-respond-to-jacksonville-shooting-with-proposa-1850780964,"WASHINGTON—Following a Jacksonville, FL mass shooting in which a white assailant killed three African Americans, Democrats in the U.S. Senate introduced a bill Monday they said would address the continuing crisis of racially motivated attacks by removing all Black people from circulation. “The only way to prevent Black lives from being cut short by these hateful killers is to drastically reduce the number of Black people allowed in public places, where it is far too easy for them to be shot at,” a visibly moved Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said of the proposed measure, which his Republican opponents claimed would do little to remove the nearly 42 million Black Americans already on the street, arguing that if “a criminal is dead set on getting his hands on a Black person, he’ll find one—legally or otherwise.” “We have to start somewhere, and right now our priority should be making it as hard as possible for virulent racists like the Jacksonville shooter to access the Black people they’re trying to murder. Look at a country like South Korea, Japan, Poland, or Iceland, where shootings like this are very rare—that’s because there are so few Black people for would-be killers to target in the first place. I’m not naïve. I know this piece of legislation would only be the first step in controlling the spread of Black people, but a national registry is the simplest, most straight-forward way to keep track of the American Americans in our communities.” Schumer went on to outline a comprehensive buy-back program that would allow any American to turn in a Black person for a cash payment, no questions asked."
Body Language Expert Explains All Republican Debate Participants Just Finished Having Sex With Each Other,N/A,https://www.theonion.com/body-language-expert-explains-all-republican-debate-par-1850770810,"MILWAUKEE—Analyzing the behavior on display during Wednesday night’s Republican presidential debate, a body language expert explained that the eight candidates who participated in the event had all just finished having sex with each other before they walked out on the stage. “It’s obvious from how many of them had messy hair, unbuttoned shirts, and loosened ties that they had all recently engaged in hot, sweaty, and vigorous group sex,” said body language specialist Jared Trujillo, who added that his 25 years of studying nonverbal communication made him adept at registering small things like the hickeys on Chris Christie’s neck and the cigarette in Doug Burgum’s hand. “Viewers at home may have noticed Asa Hutchinson’s laid-back swagger or Tim Scott’s continual need to cuddle, not to mention the used condom stuck to Ron DeSantis’ shoe and the enormous cum stains on Vivek Ramaswamy’s pants. If you look closely at the debate footage, you can even see that Nikki Haley, whose dress was on backward, was holding her heels in one hand while ordering an Uber with the other.” Trujillo went on to state that by watching Mike Pence’s lips carefully, he could tell the former vice president was both praying for forgiveness and had recently eaten ass."

Help! Help!

Tim Scott, you’re good to go. Nikki Haley, I’m going to have to ask you to leave. Per GOP rules, you are not permitted to state your gender as ‘female’ and then enter the debate wearing a pantsuit.” At press time, Donald Trump, who refused to participate in the debate, argued that as a former president of the United States, his genital inspection should remain classified."

Best Strategies From Ron DeSantis’ Leaked Debate Memo,N/A,https://www.theonion.com/best-strategies-from-ron-desantis-leaked-debate-memo-1850758973,"A leaked memo from the Never Back Down super PAC provided a  helpful plan of action for Gov. Ron DeSantis to follow during Wednesday night’s debate. The Onion examines the best strategies  from the document. Voters love a well-lubricated mouth! If you start to get nervous, just run. Any direction, as fast as you can. It’s much better than having to stomach you trying to say something. If you aren’t willing to suffer, then do you even love the United States? Word choice is very important when referring to minority communities, and the term “Black” ensures everyone knows what you mean. (They kind of lost their temper here.) If you can hit all the high notes in this classic of the mezzo-soprano repertoire, then no one—absolutely no one—is going to question your right to be on that stage. A bona fide crowd-pleaser. Keep it chill, like you’re cruisin’ on the strip with your top down, shades on at night, the flashing city lights dancing to the infectious rhythms of the funky beat. You’re outta sight, jack, you’re outta sight. Better to let it all out in the bathroom afterwards than to give Vivek Ramaswamy the satisfaction of seeing how badly his words hurt you. A list of possible words DeSantis could use includes “when,” “made,” “but,” and “buckle.” The memo recommends the 2024 candidate attack the production company behind such films as Geostorm and Transformers: Rise Of The Beasts at least three to five times throughout the evening. Everyone hates it when you laugh. Reminding the audience that he is still turgid every 15 to 30 seconds with a well-placed “I’m hard, by the way” or “Yup, still hard” will help the governor combat perceptions that he is weak. You don’t want to be labeled “Milky DeSantis” by rivals. Should you ever get overwhelmed by opponents bringing up your flagging poll numbers, simply start snapping and vocalizing nonsense syllables in time, getting louder and louder until everyone else goes quiet. Then you can take center stage and begin dancing around wildly! Remember that saying what is honest from deep down is always the right move. Just be your authentic self, and the right people will resonate with your message! Safety first! If you get nervous, you can piss your pants, but only make a little dot. Don’t let it be so much that it goes down your leg, allowing the other candidates to see or smell it. You did such a good job memorizing them, so if you get cornered, you can begin listing every U.S. state capital to show you’re more intelligent than your opponents. The PAC was hopeful that putting on a sexy British accent would make DeSantis sound smarter as well as distract from his overall appearance. Although a large, man-sized Mickey Mouse will be sitting in the debate audience staring directly at DeSantis and breathing heavily, the governor is not to make eye contact. Ultimately, the easiest way to connect with GOP voters. DeSantis was instructed to show dominance by walking up to his opponent, inhaling, and swallowing Ramaswamy in one fell swoop. According to the memo, DeSantis should make a fist, repeatedly punch himself in the face, and then scream, “An undocumented did this! An undocumented did this!” Even though he’s an opponent, DeSantis is only to refer to Trump as “our Heavenly Father” or “the one true God.” Christians Explain Why Jesus Was Too Liberal Everything Trump Did In Georgia To Try To Overturn The 2020 Election Conservatives Explain Why Libraries Should Be Defunded  Homepage"

The Onion asked Trump supporters why they posted the jurors’ personal information online, and this is why they said. “Obviously, if people are gonna murder them, an address would be handy.” “They made the mistake of having an address.” “I feel left out that I haven’t been charged for a crime yet.” “What can I say? I love connecting people.” “I know Trump would do the same for me if our roles were reversed.” “I think it’s cowardly to not at least be open to having a healthy debate on your doorstep with a complete stranger in the middle of the night.” “I figured I’d never get in trouble since Democrats fired every cop in America and replaced them with DEI officers.” “Well, I’m open to other ideas for intimidating current and future jurors.” “They need to know that they can’t just get away with examining the evidence and presenting a decision in accordance with the law.” “This is the most fun Truth Social has ever been, and I’m not supposed to participate?” “I just bet it makes Mr. Trump feel real good to know he’s got somebody out there on his side. Like, he’s up in that magnificent home of his, and he’s thinking, ‘Man, I’ve got it all, but it’s nothing compared to what Mr. Crenshaw has done for me.’ Because it turns out, he knows me! He knows my name! He’s even got a picture of me on his desk. Me! Little old Joshie Crenshaw! And just thinking about that makes me turn off the car engine and open the garage door and know I’ve got a reason to face another day.” “I’m incredibly jealous of all of them as someone who has never been described as a ‘grand’ anything.” “I’m just really hoping it inspires one of them to doxx me back.” “Whoa, whoa, all I did was retweet someone else’s grotesque violation of those people’s privacy.” “Well, we all know the president’s address, so it only seemed fair.” “Wanted to send a message that would make them think twice about indicting Donald Trump, a message that, in hindsight, probably would’ve worked better prior to them and three other grand juries handing down indictments.” “I did crime to get Trump out of his crime.

Ron DeSantis Booed Off Stage After Flashing His Stomach,N/A,https://www.theonion.com/ron-desantis-booed-off-stage-after-flashing-his-stomach-1850735733,"DES MOINES, IA—Triggering an ear-splitting backlash from voters gathered at the Iowa State Fair, Ron DeSantis was reportedly booed off stage this week after flashing his stomach on stage. Several reports indicated that DeSantis stopped speaking mid-sentence at the campaign event to lift his shirt into the air, silently exposing the entirety of his plump abdomen to the crowd of Republican voters, who immediately began heckling the candidate. According to eye witness accounts, the Florida governor attempted to regain control of the room by giving his stomach a single enthusiastic slap, which only further provoked the furious crowd to take off their own shirts, ball up the garments, and pelt  the candidate, screaming “Cover up, freak” and “We want Trump’s tummy.” At press time, the DeSantis campaign had issued a statement clarifying that the candidate was trying to communicate that he was hungry to end wokeness."
Everything Trump Did In Georgia To Try To Overturn The 2020 Election,N/A,https://www.theonion.com/everything-trump-did-in-georgia-to-try-to-overturn-the-1850736638,"Despite audits finding no evidence of fraud in the 2020 election, Donald Trump allegedly pressured Georgia officials to meddle with ballots and spread conspiracy theories about the election’s validity. The Onion examines everything Trump did in Georgia to try to overturn the 2020 election. What a fucking pathetic excuse for an autocrat. While he’s not strictly responsible for the racist and classist bipartisan effort to curb democracy, he did a pretty thorough job coasting on it. He was forced to seek alternative measures due to long response times from police. Sadly, the fast-food chain was only able to provide him with around 200. The de-voting fluid may have caused as many as 30 pen-filled bubble votes to evaporate. Trump was apparently misled t0 believe that marrying the governor means you automatically win the state. “I Am President, I Am President, I Am President.” Although both architects of the 9/11 attacks were confirmed dead decades ago, that didn’t stop Trump from trying to damage Atlanta DA Fani Willis’ reputation. Reaching a point of desperation, Trump decided to make an ill-advised purchase of a macaque from Malaysia and tried for days to instruct the monkey on how to identify which ballots were votes for Biden so he could steal them. Although the compromising photos of the voting machine were later discredited, the damage had already been done. Trump vowed that if Georgia pulled through for him, he would declassify all the secret government files about the shadowy figure we know as “George Washington.” His efforts were appreciated, but they had already cast their ballots. Luckily, they were pro–Grover Cleveland ballots from the election of 1884. Trump repeatedly pressured the media mogul to “find more votes” despite Perry repeatedly explaining that the BET series The Oval is pure fiction. Shows how serious he was about staying president. Even though Trump didn’t necessarily truly believe  this would have any bearing on the election results, he hedged his bets by explaining to his sons that committing a sin of the flesh would take away votes from their father. Even though he passed out before they blew off the table, his intention was the same. After hearing about what complete sluts Dominion voting machines are, Trump figured he could set up a little quid pro quo arrangement to secure his win. He was really laying on the potential bribes thick. After everything he did to undermine the democratic process, Trump realized that he didn’t truly have to do anything, and that just being the immoral, spiteful demagogue he was would always be enough to erode fairness within the U.S. It’s unclear how this would have helped his quest for the U.S. presidency, but he was arrested for trespassing on the property several times nonetheless. Prohibited under Chapter 183-1 of the Georgia Election Code. He didn’t find anything that would have helped him overturn the election, but had a lot of fun just looking around regardless. Trump claimed the only real Biden on the ballot was him. Ouch. Unfortunately, Trump is still coming into his powers and lacks the mental strength necessary to move thousands of ballots with his mind. While almost certainly illegal, feasting on volunteers likely only had localized effects. Trump was smart to reach out to the shadowy GOP operatives who successfully stopped the count in Florida, but he may not have been persistent enough. Although the then-senator would have still voted for him, Trump reportedly wanted to make extra sure the vote was received. Trump reportedly created a diversion for Rudy Giuliani to copy confidential data from voting machines by walking into a police office in downtown Atlanta and confessing to kidnapping Charles Lindbergh in 1932. This was mostly to make fun of Jared Kushner, but the authorities decided to  include it in the Georgia indictment as a hate crime. Donald Trump personally jerked off all 5 million adult male residents of the state of Georgia and was disappointed to discover that it did not immediately secure their votes.

And this  is just the beginning. Israel knows that if they normalize ties with the  Saudis, that raises the likelihood of other Gulf States joining them in  killing and maiming Palestinians.” At press time, Israel had reportedly  attempted to show its seriousness by beheading a journalist reporting  on the deal for an American newspaper."

By the end of the conversation, it was clear he’d secured the corn dog’s vote.

Republicans Explain Why Trump Is Innocent,N/A,https://www.theonion.com/republicans-explain-why-trump-is-innocent-1850705405,"Following the former president’s third indictment, The Onion asked Republicans to explain why Donald Trump is innocent, and this is what they said. ”Eyewitnesses, verified text messages, recorded phone calls, physical evidence, his own confessions caught on tape—It’s just not enough to go on.” “I mean, personally I stopped trying to employ any type of logic to explain my pro-Trump position a long time ago.” “President Dad IMPOTENT!!!” “Hey, there are two sides to every story, and women are liars. That’s what this is about, right?” “This is all just a deep-state Democratic plot to distract me while I’m driving so I commit crimes like manslaughter and leaving the scene of an accident!” “Have we truly grown so cynical that a man’s word isn’t enough?” “Donald Trump came to me in a dream and told me that not only is he innocent, but that I am his one true successor.” “He doesn’t have the ridges that characterize the skull shape of a criminal.” “He’s covered under the same constitutional right that says a beautiful lady cannot get a traffic ticket.” “Commiting a crime or two doesn’t mean you’re not innocent.” “I’m not sure you can be found guilty for trying to subvert democracy when we don’t live in a democracy? That’s like getting arrested for vehicular manslaughter after hitting a mannequin.” “Would a guilty man sweat so profusely? I don’t think so.” “Allow me to explain my position using a witch hunt metaphor.” “The Founding Fathers in their infinite wisdom wrote in the constitution that Trump wasn’t guilty.” “I hope they toss him in jail and throw away the key. And then I find the key and let him out and he’s so, so grateful that he let’s me use his golden shitter.” “After seeing that he makes surprise pop-ins at Mar-A-Lago events, I paid huge money to host my birthday party there. That way, my crush, who is a huge fan of him, would definitely come. If he goes to jail and doesn’t show up, I’m never going to get a smooch.” “Surprisingly, he came into my confessional and I absolved him of his sins. Thus he is innocent in the eyes of the Lord.” “I did his roof. Didn’t see anything guilty happening through the hole.” “If President Trump guilty of anything, it’s of being a damn good golfer who committed treason.” “I am less interested in why Trump is innocent, and more why Trump is at all.” “Pops, you mean? My ol’ pops? Guilty? Aw, go on now. Shucks. He ain’t done nothing.” “Trust me. He’s innocent.” “Title 18 § 371 of the U.S. Criminal Code is obviously a slut who’s just lying for attention.” “I screened him for guilt and it came up negative.

The Onion Explains ‘Bidenomics’,N/A,https://www.theonion.com/the-onion-explains-bidenomics-1850701243,"President Biden seems poised to make “Bidenomics”—a raft of economic legislation passed during his term, as well as future proposals—the centerpiece of his reelection campaign, arguing that the U.S. economy is strong. But is it really? The Onion answers the most important questions about Bidenomics and its effects on regular Americans. Q: What is “Bidenomics”? A: A term as vague, ineffective, and meaningless as you’d expect from a Democratic administration. Q: How will this legislation help everyday Americans? A: Proponents of Bidenomics estimate the average American will save as many as .07 seconds combining the words “Biden” and “economics.”  Q: What’s the most essential element of Bidenomics? A: Basically, any positive part of the current economy is Bidenomics, and any negatives, those are not Bidenomics.  Q: Why is the president making Bidenomics such a central point of his reelection campaign? A: Some other guy already took his idea of building a wall between the United States and Mexico. Q: I’m poor. How will Bidenomics help me? A: That depends. Do you run a computer chip manufacturing plant? Q: What are some economic wins under the Biden administration? A: Fewer banks need bailouts, all PPP loans have been forgiven, and the average American CEO is seeing more drilling profits than ever.  Q: What are some of the key indicators of Bidenomics? A: Green lines up, red lines down.  Q: How has Bidenomics impacted the cost of prescription drugs? A: The drugs your insurance plan doesn’t cover are cheaper now. Q: Is focusing on his economic policies a good reelection strategy for Biden?  A: It’s rarely ever smart to hitch your wagon to the state of America. Q: If the economy is so good, why is everyone I know struggling?  A: Those people don’t count."

DeSantis is the one whom Americans could best picture sitting at the end of a bar by himself and avoiding eye contact with anyone else except when he needs to order another drink,” said Pew spokesperson Kevin Neeley, who noted that approximately two-thirds of poll respondents stated that they could easily visualize the two-term governor and former congressman staring into his half-empty beer glass and letting out a long sigh as his visibly forced smile drained from his face. “What this tells us is that voters see DeSantis as the sort of guy who could really just spend a whole evening nursing a Heineken alone in a dark corner of a bar. Maybe he tries to strike up a conversation with a group of regulars and then realizes no one heard him and so he lapses into dead silence again. Really, this is some of the best news his campaign could hope for at this point.” The poll also showed that Trump remained the candidate voters could most imagine getting drinks with a Ku Klux Klan grand dragon.

Did Hunter Biden rent an Airbnb with a fireplace for the weekend? Did Hunter Biden’s session involve nearly a dozen costume changes along with a professional hair and makeup team? No, because he is nothing but a corrupt pervert.” At press time, Greene added that Hunter Biden’s photographs were barely titillating. "

Flexing your elbows ever so slightly while you lower yourself half an inch toward the ground is not a fucking push-up. Anyone unwilling to switch political parties for personal gain has no business becoming president. Federal law states that all executions must be carried out by lethal injection. RFK Jr. is almost definitely not the guy on money. If this is true, then why are most gorillas under 6 feet tall? Get this lunatic back to the asylum. Jesus, just say where the bathroom is. That’s all he said, but we didn’t like his tone. Thankfully, he did such a good job that it’s not a problem anymore, freeing him up to worry about things like cancel culture and deplatforming. He also repeatedly claimed that Yosemite caused autism. Yeah, right. He’s repeatedly claimed the bullet that killed his father was Jewish, making the same claim about the bullet that killed his uncle JFK and the small plane that killed his cousin JFK Jr. He was simply quoting the distinguished pediatric neurologist Jenny McCarthy. To be fair, he said this while very tired and staring at a can of Red Bull. Everyone knows JFK was killed by the polio vaccine. While wrongheaded and antisemitic, it seems like it’s a really important part of his understanding of his family’s lore. The most attractive Kennedy was Joseph Kennedy Sr. and everyone knows it.

Once the financial situation improves, we could possibly hire her back  as a part-time spousal contractor to pose for photos as DeSantis’ wife every now and then, but right now her role is not economically feasible.” Peck added that the campaign was already looking to replace DeSantis’ children with cheaper migrant labor."

Whether it’s accepting illicit campaign contributions, using official government resources for campaign purposes, or failing to properly file expenditure reports, we need evidence from news articles, video recordings, or official stationary that the candidate’s campaign is violating federal law in multiple ways. Alternatively, if a candidate is unable to reach the 20,000 campaign ethics violations threshold, we’ll make an exception if they can prove that they’ve personally committed at least a Class X felony embezzlement from their campaign funds.” The RNC also reportedly set as an additional requirement for debate qualification that all candidates must sign a pledge to commit ethics violations on behalf of the eventual Republican nominee."

Most-Homophobic Statements Made By Ron DeSantis,N/A,https://www.theonion.com/most-homophobic-statements-made-by-ron-desantis-1850607108,"Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida is facing backlash for his long history of antigay remarks, both in office and on the presidential campaign trail. The Onion examines some of the most homophobic statements he’s made throughout his career. No, that’s the vaccines, you bigot. Meeting Ron DeSantis is a trauma that no person—regardless of sexuality, gender identity, race, religion, or creed—should ever have to endure. Only a homophobe would draw this distinction. Opposite-sex encounters are the only ones he wants performed in front of children. DeSantis paused after he said this during a speech to open a new building at the Kennedy Space Center and got no applause for it. Not sure where he came up with this one. DeSantis personally thinks Jacksonville is Florida’s paradise. Conservatives denied this was homophobic, but read between the lines and it’s a pretty clear antigay dog whistle. He then went on an expletive-laced screed denouncing woke cetaceans. DeSantis subscribes to the fringe ideology that denies gay identity because there is no evidence in the fossil record of homosexual activity amongst dinosaurs. DeSantis often ends his stump speeches with a laundry list of pop culture gripes. At this point, he’s just trying to get assassinated. The dates don’t at all line up with DeSantis’ age, but the rest checks out. It should be understood at this point that everything he says is an attack on the LGBTQIA+ community. DeSantis thinks it’s pretty masculine and superior to wear an entire wardrobe that doesn’t flatter one’s figure. Hateful because it’s an unfortunate truth we all have to live with.

A lot of people forget Mr. Cain was our party’s frontrunner in the 2012 race until he was sidelined by accusations of sexual misconduct, something that is no longer an impediment to a Republican seeking public office. And polls show swing voters and independents are more likely to see him as a sympathetic figure since his tragic death three years ago.” A Quinnipiac University Poll released earlier this week found that nine in 10 registered voters described Cain as only “slightly less alive” than President Joe Biden."

A small contingent even worried the presidents would make jokes about them being on the toilet to fellow patrons. These are bleak results for the frontrunners heading into 2024—some of the lowest since the 1980 election, when most thought they would leave the bathroom to find Jimmy Carter wandering over and finishing their half-eaten sandwich.” The Pew poll did find, however, that many Americans would settle for Trump or Biden if the other clientele at the café were Ron DeSantis, Chris Christie, or Marianne Williamson."

Think of the party!” said an apparition of the 35th president who is visible only to Feinstein and has served as her top aide since he entered her hospital room last month, trailing behind him the endless brain tissue that continually oozes from a wound in his skull. “There is nothing left for you in the Senate, Dianne, or indeed in this earthly realm. Soon you will carry out the ultimate service to your country by joining me on the other side. And together, we will govern the afterlife!” At press time, Feinstein told sources she felt betrayed after discovering the phantasm of Kennedy was merely angling to be appointed to her vacant Senate seat."
Politicians Explain Why They Oppose Gender-Affirming Care,N/A,https://www.theonion.com/politicians-explain-why-they-oppose-gender-affirming-ca-1850313268,"At least 13 states have passed laws banning gender-affirming care for trans youth, including life-saving treatments like hormone therapy and puberty blockers. The Onion asked politicians why they oppose gender-affirming care, and this is what they said. “I consider it sexual abuse, and I’ve decided I suddenly care about that.” “Whether you were born male or female, I’m opposed to the existence of genitals in all their forms.” “Seems like an easy way to annoy everyone who voted for me.” “To fulfill my pathological need to exert power over our society’s most vulnerable, obviously. Dumb question.” “It’s not up to young people to decide what gender they are. It’s up to my campaign donors.” “No child should ever be affirmed about anything, ever.” “None of my girlfriends have been mature enough to make such a life-altering decision.” “Allowing someone to feel comfortable and confident in their own body is something I’ve opposed since the beginning of my career.” “It gives the inaccurate impression that doctors do more than just prescribe opiates.” “It is a fact that the first sign of child abuse is a kid liking themselves.” “It’s unnatural for a teenager to alter their body in a way that makes me not attracted to them.” “There hasn’t been a single pro-gender-affirming lobbyist even trying to throw millions at me.” “Anything to keep voters’ attention off my state’s poverty, crime, economy, drug problems, schools, and police departments.” “That sounds suspiciously like healthcare.” “I believe in a small government that inspects children’s genitals.” “If we let people be themselves, what next? Anyone can grow a beard? No one needs to buy a fake beard? I have to find another way to unload this warehouse full of beards?” “You lost me at gender, then again at affirming, and finally at care.”"
Most Inflammatory Things Trump Has Said Since Being Indicted,N/A,https://www.theonion.com/most-inflammatory-things-trump-has-said-since-being-ind-1850303619,"Following his recent arrests, former President Donald Trump has made a number of provocative remarks. The Onion examines the most inflammatory things Trump has said since being indicted. Supporters were baffled and slightly disappointed by the former president’s request for this gentle act of protest. Careful with the base, there, Donny. Trump has maintained he was born in 2018. Prominent people aren’t supposed to say things like this, because people might actually listen to them. Disgusting. Although two for one seemed like a fair trade, the Manhattan district attorney apparently did not agree. There is no justice left regardless. This is an insult to the thousands of hardworking reporters who have appeared on these networks covering this story over the past several days. Um, not without seeing your certification in proper canning methods for safe and effective food preservation, Mr. President. Shrieked while standing at the top of a flight of stairs as a stroller holding Barron rolled down toward the busy street. No one is trying to make him do this. He meant Deep State, and seems to have simply misspoke. He shouldn’t have mentioned this. While technically true, his tone wasn’t great. This is what Trump says to Barron whenever Barron wants to hang out. Trump said this after dropping his calzone. With statements like this, some have become concerned that Trump may be a narcissist. While The Bends may include many great songs, as a composed album it doesn’t even come close to reaching the artistic highs of OK Computer. The former president should have consulted with his lawyer before he ballooned out his cheeks and tried to imitate a clown fish in the fish tank on his desk. Then what was he doing as president? Illegal things are what the voters elected him to do. Shouted at the moment of climax. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Did he say “Blacks”? Yeesh. Alvin Bragg is a certified cutie pie. Uttered right as the nation finally got a different song stuck in their heads. Animal crackers in soup sounds gross.

I don’t need you to hold me, but you could if you really wanted to. Maybe run your fingers through my hair like mommy used to do when I was a child. Fine I’ll let you hold me, since you want to so badly.” “Look, I already got the gig I wanted, so I really don’t pay attention to politics anymore.” “This leaves me no choice but to be convicted of the same crimes so that I can break him out of prison from the inside.” “Thank God. I was running out of things to talk about in my fundraising emails.” “Of course my shipment of C4 gets delayed right when I need it.” “Jimmy sad because Jimmy no know what’s gonna happen to Trump friend.

Specifically, me choosing whatever is most politically expedient in the moment.” “A woman’s throat is simply too delicate and dainty to be able to swallow a pill.” “Abortion is healthcare, so Americans have no right to it.” “They are highly ineffective.

Spencer Cox, who stressed that the sexual exploitation of teenagers was a very serious matter in Utah and should be carried out exclusively by elders in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. “We believe that intrusive questions about a teen’s sexuality should be asked behind closed doors by a bishop—not on some social media site by a stranger. And when that child is eventually blackmailed into sexual slavery, who better to oversee that process than a man who is highly respected in the community and represents an institution that is beyond reproach?” Cox added that the digital trail of evidence left behind by online predators also made it that much harder to orchestrate a cover-up of the abuse and pretend it never happened."

Sometimes people can get really nasty  about politics. But, aside from a few typos, blood-stains, and the  toxic powder, this really seems to be coming from someone who cares  about these issues and wants to see the country do better.” Williams  added that the biggest shame was that all these interesting points would unfortunately be overshadowed by the three congressional  aides sent to the hospital."

This isn’t merely an egregious violation of basic labor laws.

Tucker Carlson’s Biggest Lies,N/A,https://www.theonion.com/tucker-carlson-s-biggest-lies-1850225955,"While the Fox News host is not necessarily known for being honest, text messages released in the Dominion Voting Systems lawsuit show that Tucker Carlson frequently lies to viewers. The Onion examines Tucker Carlson’s biggest lies. Carlson has repeatedly claimed on-air that the QAnon Shaman had IBS and thus had no choice but to release his bowels all over Nancy Pelosi’s office, and that anyone who disputed this was simply being ableist. Tucker Carlson has been a registered member of the Green Party since 1991. No, there is hope: a young peasant girl from the village, as foretold by the prophecy. Tucker Carlson is a television host. He absolutely would, in a heartbeat. Bow tie cancer is exceedingly rare. This one is actually true. The Capitol building is boring as shit, and in a town with the Lincoln Memorial, the Smithsonian, and the National Gallery of Art, no self-respecting tourist would waste their valuable time sightseeing at the fucking Capitol building. Yet again, Carlson proves himself to be a lib in sheep’s clothing. It was only a shadow, although he did get scared. That was Brian Kilmeade. In fact, Carlson wears the blue, puffy shirt he wore on the program every single night to bed. While Carlson has regularly called for the deportation of illegal immigrants, his repeated attempts to use them to sell hair supplements is just pathetic. Far be it from us to disagree with the Lollipop Man; however, in this instance, he appears to be fibbing. Fauci and the novel coronavirus are work acquaintances and nothing more. He left MSNBC in 2008, not 2007. This one isn’t so much a lie as it is misleading, since it’s odd to single out Trump among the 3.5 million of his viewers he absolutely loathes. While it is unfathomable to think that not one but two people could find Tucker Carlson desirable, this one is true. This is what Fox was covering as the Jan. 6 insurrection took place. Carlson’s assertion that Covid-19 was created in a studio session during a Method Man verse is unsubstantiated. While technically true, it’s not for the reasons Carlson believes. Yet again, Carlson has mistaken himself for peanut butter. Information about the Brazilian three-banded armadillo is widespread and easy to find online. He just never figured out how to use it correctly. Whenever there’s a slow news day, Carlson claims the purple M&M met him when he was just 16 years old and immediately seduced him."

But here in Florida, we know that shoving a baby out of a woman’s vagina is pornographic, and we’re not going to tolerate it.

And why the fuck do I pay for coverage if it doesn’t cover anything? That ambulance ride alone cost a thousand bucks, and of course those assholes drove me to an out-of-network hospital!” Unsure how else to stop racking up medical expenses and becoming an even greater burden to his family, McConnell reportedly threw himself out a hospital window and plummeted to his death."

Take it from us, confining your anti-trans agenda to either willful inaction or silent legislative maneuvers definitely still gets the job done.” At press time, Schumer called on Democrats to continue to sit back, do nothing, and tell their LGBTQIA+ constituents that they were doing everything they could to protect them."

Mark Warner (D-VA), adding that legislative work in the upper chamber of Congress had been brought to a virtual standstill because dozens of senators couldn’t stop scrolling through TikTok videos and bursting into tears. “We wanted to do some research into TikTok to see for ourselves how it threatens public security, but we all ended up addicted to watching weight-loss and dieting TikToks, which made us all feel really bad about our bodies. This app simply makes it far too easy for users, including all 100 United States senators, to develop depression and low self-esteem. Jon Tester (D-MT) just ran off saying he didn’t want to see anyone until he’s lost 20 pounds, Mitt Romney (R-UT) has been in the bathroom for over 90 minutes, and we just watched Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) eat an entire chocolate cake. Both Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and Cindy Hyde Smith (R-MI) have unveiled big visual aids counting their calories, and the hashtag #WhatIEatInADay has been trending around the Senate. Chuck Grassley (R-IA) has been doing crunches on the Senate floor, and Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) is begging us all to follow her weight-loss journey on the app. TikTok is, without a doubt, a growing threat to a functional American society.” At press time, Congress had passed a massive bipartisan funding bill to purchase diet pills they saw on TikTok.

According to sources, Dore was blissfully able to go about her afternoon despite being only 60 or so days out from hearing the governor of Florida’s name dozens of times an hour, whether it would be overheard on public transportation, from argumentative pundits referencing him on the news, or from her own mouth as she expressed her derision over his politics. Sources confirmed that, for now, the serene woman was free to think about whatever she liked, as her mind would not be 100 percent preoccupied by reckoning with the phrase “President DeSantis” for another several news cycles, at which point she would be immediately bombarded with his opinions on the issues facing the nation from the moment she woke up in the morning until she tried and failed to fall asleep at night. Despite being mere weeks away from being plunged into a sea of thinkpieces, photographs, and sound bites centered on the Republican, the happy, satisfied woman was reportedly able to concentrate fully on work for the last time before her current placidity would come crashing down in a bombardment of hateful and regressive Ron DeSantis campaign ads."

If they think they can indoctrinate children into thinking I have anything other than a shapely-if-hefty backside, then they have another think coming.” At press time, DeSantis had signed an executive order banning all pants in the state of Florida."

Those are his heavy-lidded, bloodshot eyes peeking out from under that rock. He may look harmless now, but don’t be fooled. He’s still feral. Be sure to step back as soon as you release the chicken, because he’s going to leap forward and grab it with a big jowly chomp before it even hits the ground. And if you think that’s neat, watch what happens when you throw a few airplane bottles of blended scotch into the cage! Video is allowed, but please refrain from flash photography, as he is quite old and easily disoriented. That’s how Kelly Anne Conway was bitten earlier.” At press time, CPAC was reportedly on lockdown after Rep.

Supreme Court Questions Whether President Legally Allowed To Improve Americans’ Lives,N/A,https://www.theonion.com/supreme-court-questions-whether-president-legally-allow-1850168743,"WASHINGTON—Expressing deep skepticism about the constitutionality of such executive actions, members of the Supreme Court’s conservative majority raised questions during oral arguments Tuesday about whether the president was legally allowed to improve the lives of Americans. “Our founders, in their abundant wisdom, saw fit to restrain the commander-in-chief from benefiting the American people in any discernible way,” said Chief Justice John G. Roberts, who joined the court’s five other Republican appointees in casting doubt on presidential efforts to even slightly lessen the burden of everyday citizens, let alone secure them some measure of peace or happiness. “Indeed, precedent suggests that our Constitution was drawn up with an eye toward maintaining the public’s general misery. Separation-of-powers principles clearly indicate that the president’s job is primarily focused on one duty: giving speeches that nobody watches or cares about.” Roberts expressed enthusiasm, however, for a related case suggesting that the chief executive’s duties could sometimes include compounding the average American’s suffering as much as humanly possible."

But don’t get used to this. And you have to promise me that no one’s going to wake up in the middle of the night and ask to come sleep with me again. If you’re a nation that’s grown up enough to stay up late, you can certainly sleep in your own beds.” At press time, Biden was heard screaming at the nation that it’s 10:15, that he doesn’t care what time Canada goes to bed, and that as long as they’re living in this country, he gets to make the rules."

I immediately removed all my clothes after realizing they were made in China, which is why I’m sitting here ass-naked.” “Kids should be socializing on an American app, like Tinder.” “I’m looking for something new to yell at children about.” “There are better conspiracy videos on YouTube.” “My ‘Democrats Be Like’ video barely got a hundred likes, which is literally impossible unless TikTok’s ‘For You’ algorithm is biased.” “Not a fan of anything that has age restrictions.” “Too many sluts.” “For the life of me, I cannot manage to go viral.” “Teens should be learning to dance by buying my workout video series Moving With Mitch.” “Charli D’Amelio won’t follow me back.” “We already have all we require.” Most Dangerous Mental Health Trends On TikTok Billionaires Predict The Biggest Threats To Humanity What To Say To Someone Who Has Fallen For A Conspiracy Theory Back To Homepage"

Better just to avoid it entirely.” “Drag queens are always showing these things called ‘books’ to my children and are clearly grooming them to read.” “If I can’t serve cunt, nobody can.” “Drag shows are sexual in nature, and children shouldn’t be exposed to anything sexual except movies, television shows, advertising, and the internet.” “Death is terrifying and it’s easier to fixate on this than think about how I’ll disappear someday.” “There aren’t really any statistics or information out there suggesting this is a problem, but I just have a gut feeling that some facts exist supporting my hatred of drag brunches.” “I’m sick of people stopping me on the street and asking if I was on Drag Race.” “My father died serving looks.” “The more popular they get, the more people are asking for homes with sizable performance spaces.” “They laughed off my idea for a big red lady named Marilyn Ketchup.” “I have even bigger hair than most of them and my tips are half as good.

Mike DeWine (R) held a press conference Thursday to champion the Norfolk Southern train derailment as a deregulation success story. “Ladies and gentlemen, behold, as the results speak for themselves—deregulation works,” said the native Ohioan to grand applause, before acknowledging the decades of hard work it took on both national and local scales to bypass costly red tape and bureaucracy and turn this forgotten part of his state into a thriving chemical wasteland, itself a testament to throwing caution and concern to the wind in favor of removing guardrails and severely underfunding infrastructure. “So rarely do we get to see such immediate change as a result of dismantling rigorous safeguards and doing away with accountability, but look at this—just yesterday this was an abandoned rural prairie full of nothing but native wildlife. Now, through a bipartisan effort to completely ignore calls to replace the Civil War-era braking systems on most of our great nation’s trains, we transformed this area seemingly overnight. You’ll notice I am tearing up, not only because the toxic fumes are now being violently blown in our direction, but because this is exactly why so many of us get into politics—to elicit tangible change that makes the lives of everyday Americans so much worse.”  At press time, DeWine announced he had now begin work on removing Ohio regulations surrounding organ donations so that residents’ now-infected body parts could be easily transplanted into healthy people to infect them as well."

Adam Schiff Seeks Diane Feinstein’s Endorsement By Playing Into Delusion He’s High School Sweetheart Who Died In WWII,N/A,https://www.theonion.com/adam-schiff-seeks-diane-feinstein-s-endorsement-by-play-1850036971,"WASHINGTON—Hoping to gain an edge over the crowded field to replace the outgoing lawmaker, Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) reportedly sought Senator Dianne Feinstein’s campaign endorsement Tuesday by playing into the delusion that he’s her high school sweetheart who actually died in World War II. Multiple Capitol sources have reported seeing the California congressman in recent days sporting a wig and a World War II uniform while escorting the 89-year-old to a vintage jalopy, telling her that he’s back from the war, and taking her to the soda fountain. While all of the California Senate candidates have sought Feinstein’s endorsement, Schiff reportedly decided to capitalize on her declining mental faculties by adopting the identity of her high school sweetheart, Roger Larsen, whom she has apparently forgotten was killed in action during the 1945 Battle of Luzon. Sources confirmed that Schiff’s efforts began in the hours after Feinstein announced she would retire when her Senate term ended, and 62-year-old Schiff entered her office in the guise of her 18-year-old high school sweetheart and told her that her parents had given him permission to take their lovely daughter Dianne Goldman for a drive. This effort seems to have been effective as an increasingly delusional Feinstein has been seen around Washington wearing a poodle skirt Schiff gave her along with his pin to symbolize his commitment, gazing dreamily at Schiff and telling him that, although she thinks he’s swell, she’s a good girl and wants to wait until marriage for her first time. Sources confirmed that Schiff has privately expressed his confidence that the Roger Larsen character can convince Feinstein to support his candidacy, as he has repeatedly told Feinstein that a brave soldier named Adam Schiff is the only reason he made it out of the Pacific Theater and back into Feinstein’s sweet, young embrace. At press time, however, Schiff’s efforts to exploit Feinstein’s disoriented fantasies were dealt a significant complication after fellow Senate candidate Rep. Katie Porter (D-CA) donned a string of pearls and a bouffant hairstyle to play into the delusion that she’s Feinstein’s mother, Betty Goldman, who died in 1983."

Seriously, he’s an astronaut, he has an identical twin brother who also went to space, and now he’s a senator? Frankly, in retrospect, the idea of Mark Kelly seems preposterous.

Good night.” The speech was immediately followed by a 30-second GOP rebuttal during which Arkansas Gov. and former Trump press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders appeared to nod off mid-falsehood."
Books Ron DeSantis Has Banned In Florida,N/A,https://www.theonion.com/books-ron-desantis-has-banned-in-florida-1850050353,"In response to new rules issued by the administration of Gov. Ron DeSantis, teachers are being ordered to remove all books from libraries and classrooms until they can be approved by a state-trained “certified media specialist.” The following books are currently banned from schools in Florida. DeSantis has repeatedly criticized Dr. Seuss’ famous character the Grinch for not being overtly Jewish enough. According to DeSantis, this book promotes harmful socialist ideology by creating in children the expectation that everyone will, in fact, get dim sum. Wrongly encourages Black people to travel by car. DeSantis famously rejects Albert Camus’ existentialist embrace of the absurd and instead favors a more Sartrean realism, as explored in the governor favorite philosophical work, Being And Nothingness. Holden should’ve been meaner to the prostitute. DeSantis deemed the book’s depiction of Humbert Humbert to be disrespectful to the state’s many pedophiles. No characters named Ron. A gateway book that leads some Floridians to a lifetime love of reading. The removal of pornography from classrooms includes the obscene story of James and his presumably fat ass. Too scary. He feels threatened by Kristy’s work ethic. Children could be tempted by circles and their devious curves. Briefly mentions Robert Todd Lincoln had a buddy who was Black. He thought this one dragged in the middle. DeSantis banned this, in addition to several other pregnancy books, out of concern that learning about the process of childbirth would lead women to seek abortions. Shoves news literacy down children’s throats. The State of Florida bans all books that depict or even acknowledge the existence of Seattle. Incorrectly introduces the idea that children may be able to hide from a fascist state.

I was actually there this morning. If you think this catering is good, wait until you’ve tried the never-ending ambrosia in the Kingdom of God. Always seems a shame when I’m jolted back to life and have to return to earth.” After a few closing remarks about how God was currently beckoning him to walk toward the light, the president ended his speech by closing his eyes and collapsing to the floor."

I’m sure you’ve had a very cool experience. There aren’t any openings, are there? There’s a Starbucks right around the corner, and I’m buying! Thanks in advance.

We have been assured it satisfies the requirements of the Wichita Department of Sanitation for a weekly pickup slot along the Tuesday route, and we are proud to be taking this bold step toward beautifying our country for future generations.” At press time, sources confirmed the trash can been rejected and removed from service by a local homeowners association for being the wrong shade of gray."

The anonymous drop box will provide a way for top executive branch officials to return these items without facing any shame for having taken documents that could have caused exceptionally grave damage to our country.”  At press time, classified materials were reportedly being piled on top of the drop box, the inside of which had been crammed to capacity.

The Onion tells you what you need to know about the presence of classified documents in officials’ homes. Q: How do former officials end up with classified documents? A: There are actually trace amounts of classified documents everywhere, from the air we breathe to the water we drink. It’s all part of nature’s classified document cycle.  Q: Why can’t presidents take classified documents home with them? A: The U.S. government encourages a healthy work-life balance. Q: Which politicians made harmless mistakes, and which ones actively endangered the safety of the country? A: The politicians you like made harmless mistakes, and the ones you don’t like actively endangered the safety of the country. Q: How can we prevent this from happening in the future? A: Unfortunately, there is no way to stop electing doddering old men to the nation’s highest offices. Q: Why was Pence holding on to classified material? A: An earnest attempt to keep male documents from sharing folders with female documents they’re not stapled to.  Q: What should I do if I discover classified documents in my home? A: Make yourself as big as possible and back away slowly. Remember, they’re more afraid of you than you are of them.  Q: Is there anything left in the National Archives? A: Just a few tank diagrams and Nancy Reagan’s beef casserole recipe. Q: What would happen if classified information is leaked? A: Journalists might actually have to report on the government’s efforts to undermine democratic decision-making, which would be really annoying for them. Q: Couldn’t this just be the FBI’s way of sneaking a peek into the homes of important people?  A: It seems unlikely, but then again, who wouldn’t want to see what kind of fucked-up shit is in Mike Pence’s house? Q: What will be the ultimate outcome of these investigations? A: Will likely further delay the opening of the Barack Obama Presidential Classified Documents Library."

But in the end, Dua Lipa and the president could not be more excited about their son, Jaxton Lipa Biden. Plus, his approval rating has already jumped up five points to a whopping 45%.” At press time, Biden was under fire for nepotism after news broke that he had briefly considered impregnating his granddaughter."

It’s been worn a few times, but you’re welcome to it. Maybe if you have a favorite player, you can write his number on there. It’s up to you, really. We don’t have a signed game ball for you, but we would like to present you with this Dick’s Sporting Goods gift card, which you can use at any location to purchase a regular basketball.” At press time, reports confirmed Harris had worn the wrinkled jersey around the West Wing for the rest of the day but no one commented on it or appeared even to notice."

My key fob doesn’t even work most days, and I have to text someone on my staff to come let me in.

Concessions Kevin McCarthy Made To Become House Speaker,N/A,https://www.theonion.com/concessions-kevin-mccarthy-made-to-become-house-speaker-1849976929,"After 15 votes and multiple days of negotiations, Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) finally won his bid to become speaker of the House. The Onion examines what concessions McCarthy had to make. McCarthy agreed to be forcibly removed from office by the 15th of next month. Plus, Andy Biggs gets to do the stabbing. He just looks more like a “Steve.” It’s critical that representatives be given time to fake like they’re doing due diligence for their constituents. While not one of the formal concessions, McCarthy is free to pretend that this was part of the deal should any Democratic representatives see him eating alone. McCarthy had to make some tough concessions to hard-liners. Everyone in the GOP agreed it was this or nothing. Although the procedure is extremely controversial and incredibly painful, the Freedom Caucus made Kevin McCarthy agree to undergo foreskin surgery before they would cast their votes. “The Star-Spangled Banner” also needs to be sung constantly in four-part harmony, while at least one member of both parties performs an interpretive dance to “Proud To Be An American” on the House floor. This must continue without interruption for the next two years. Blink and the timer starts over. Opponents of McCarthy demanded he begin showing respect for authority by turning his backwards hat brim around to the front, despite the move putting his notoriously cool bad-boy attitude at risk. A hard decision, but McCarthy will still be able to see them every other weekend. Technically, all members of Congress were supposed to have this done as soon as they were sworn in, but it is a significant step nonetheless. Eye contact required. McCarthy must ride bitch in the backseat on any congressional excursions from the Capitol. McCarthy is allowed to accidentally kill one person by friendly fire each week, but if he does more than that, he will be replaced. In case McCarthy chooses to sleep around with anyone he wants as speaker of the House, he should be aware of the potential consequences. If passed, McCarthy may choose his method of suicide. Far-right Republicans claim they cannot govern unless they have high-definition security footage from every toilet in the Capitol. In case they do not agree with his governing style, the Freedom Caucus made Kevin McCarthy replace the speaker’s chair with an ejector seat that would launch him through the Capitol ceiling and over 50 feet into the air. The Freedom Caucus has been waiting for their turn with the Democrats’ kente cloth since Pelosi stepped down, and God only knows what they’re going to do with it now.

Upon confirming all members of her staff, who she had allegedly not seen in months, had left work for the day, Harris is said to have entered her office for the sole purpose of using a printer to access a pair of passes to that night’s Goo Goo Dolls show at the Merriweather Post pavilion in Columbia, MD. As a precaution in case she encountered her chief of staff or one of her aides, sources confirmed the vice president walked into the facility with her phone up to her ear, ready to engage in a phony conversation about how climate change was a “really tough issue” and to sigh loudly in order to sound very busy. According to reports, Harris then logged into Ticketmaster from her office computer, downloaded a file she renamed “border_security_ideas.pdf,” and printed the document with a nearby Epson EcoTank Pro ET-5850. After the vice president grabbed a granola bar from the kitchen and slipped out of the office mostly undetected, the Eisenhower building’s IT administrator was overheard giving Harris a hard time for using up all of the printer’s ink on her full-color personal holiday cards."

But you, well, pretty soon you’re going to be down there in the ground. So you can’t stay here. Are you still following me, Dianne? This office is mine.” At press time, sources confirmed Porter had been forced to wipe the board clean and start over by explaining that the Hart Senate Office Building was not Feinstein’s home and she did not live there."
Matt Gaetz Accuses Roblox Of Silencing Conservative Voices,N/A,https://www.theonion.com/matt-gaetz-accuses-roblox-of-silencing-conservative-voi-1849976136,"WASHINGTON—Claiming that he had been systematically banned from playing games, purchasing Robux, or communicating with other users due to his political beliefs, Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) told reporters Wednesday he had evidence that Roblox was actively silencing conservative voices. “Today, on Roblox, I was disgusted to find that my highly customized avatar, my in-game achievements, and my friends list had been totally wiped, all because I dared to speak my mind as a white, conservative man in America,” said Gaetz, who added that the gaming platform, which is popular among adolescents, had consistently and pervasively discriminated against prominent, outspoken Republican legislators and pundits like him. “As an active member of Roblox since 2017, I was disturbed, but not surprised, to find that the liberal elite had conspired to remove my friendship badge and ban me from playing my favorite pizza game on my private Discord server with my 900 mutuals. What if conservatives want to hunt virtual easter eggs or attend a Roblox Twenty One Pilots concert? The leftists in charge of Roblox are trying to prevent conservatives from seeking the truth and learning what users are wearing, where they live, and if their parents are home. Until we have a Roblox that supports free speech, people like me will always be second-class citizens.” At press time, Gaetz could not be reached for comment after evidence surfaced that he had sent a large number of Robux transactions to underage girls."
McCarthy Elected Speaker After Far-Right GOP Minority Joins Rest Of Far-Right GOP Majority,N/A,https://www.theonion.com/mccarthy-elected-speaker-after-far-right-gop-minority-j-1849965999,"WASHINGTON—Following a tense four days in Congress’ lower chamber that saw members of his own party vote to deny him the top spot 14 straight times, Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) was elected speaker of the House early Saturday morning when the far-right GOP minority joined together with the rest of the far-right GOP majority. “It took a while, but we were finally able to get our 20 most right-wing members to compromise with our other 200 most right-wing members,” said Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-NC), a McCarthy ally who was instrumental in helping the new speaker win over members of the hard-right House Freedom Caucus with key concessions to the majority GOP’s hard-right plans for this congressional term. “Electing Kevin showed that we’re able to smooth over the differences between the far-right faction and the other far-right faction to pursue our identical policy goals of eradicating the social safety net, punishing immigrants, and trying to subvert democratic elections, as well as find key compromises in the approach all of us will take to undermine a functional government. Whether you’re one of the holdouts who wants Republicans to pursue a radically conservative agenda, or one of the stalwart McCarthy backers who wants a reactionary right-wing agenda, you have a place in the McCarthy-led House. It’s a good sign for Americans that we’re able to compromise despite seeing eye to eye on every issue.” McCarthy allies also told reporters that the concessions allowed them to avoid the nightmare scenario of some of the far-right Republicans moving to align with the right-wing faction of the Democratic Party."

This has been the worst week of my life,” said the visibly frustrated California lawmaker, whose bid for the role of House speaker has been met with persistent opposition among members of his own party and has been the cause of severe anxiety that, McCarthy noted, was not being helped at all by the vengeful return of his urinary incontinence problem. “Man, I thought a dozen failed attempts for the speakership, our dog running away, and spilling coffee all over my desk yesterday were as bad as it could get, but now I’m peeing all over my sheets in the middle of the night. It’s like my freshman year of Congress all over again. Ugh, I just completely reek of piss.

We’ve also received word from Capitol sources that this burst of productivity from our elected officials might not even be over—we could see an ninth, tenth, or even 11th vote today. This level of voting right out of the gate hasn’t been seen in America in over a century, and it bodes well for our nation’s future.” At press time, several new polls found that a majority of Americans supported giving the hardworking representatives a few days or even weeks off to rest."

The Onion takes a step-by-step look at how the speaker of the House is elected. STEP 1: All Americans best suited to position eliminated well before actual elections. STEP 2: Each party meets in backroom to vote on which backroom to hold speaker nomination in.  STEP 3: House clerk performs a quorum call, a complex set of tones and whistles that a female quorum finds irresistible.  STEP 4: DNA testing to determine who is most genetically similar to George Washington. STEP 5: Round-robin ping-pong tournament. STEP 6: Racist lunatic weighs in. STEP 7: If no candidate wins on first ballot, the majority party candidate’s opponents are reminded that they’re all in this to destroy the country together.  STEP 8: If a candidate doesn’t win on the first six ballots—well, only a total loser would continue asking for the job after losing six ballots in a row. Seriously, six ballots? How fucking pathetic would that person have to be? Honestly, this would be a national humiliation of epic proportions—so embarrassing, in fact, that you have to assume there’s no chance it will ever actually happen. STEP 9: New speaker spends sterling career leading unanimous approvals for higher military budgets."

Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) assured his skeptical GOP colleagues Tuesday that he shared their vision of innocents drowning in oceans of blood. “While I hear your concerns and am prepared to make a long list of concessions in exchange for your support, at the end of the day, we all want to joyously stomp on the necks of hardworking Americans as they pathetically cry out for a mercy that shall never come,” the California lawmaker said in an impassioned plea to House Republicans, responding to criticism from far-right members of his party who argue he no longer represents the values of those focused on littering this country from coast to coast with the gory entrails of its docile populace. “We cannot let  petty differences get in the way of what could be our most grisly era of violent brutality yet—not while there remains significant common ground on our big-picture goals of every street running red with the sputtering viscera of innocent women and children. I mean, certainly my record of damning my constituents to a life of unparalleled pain and suffering counts for something. Meanwhile, this infighting remains a useless distraction keeping us from slowly drawing our knives across the necks of ordinary Americans and letting the streams of gushing blood spill into our hands until a red tsunami washes away everything in a wave of ferocious splendor.

Politicians Explain Why They Oppose Term Limits,N/A,https://www.theonion.com/politicians-explain-why-they-oppose-term-limits-1849905462,"While term limits may be popular among young legislators, many older career politicians have bristled at the idea. The Onion asked politicians why they oppose caps on government leadership, and this is what they said. “Legislators are proud people who have never known any other work and have been legislating for generations. What else are they supposed to do?” “I get paid $174k, and I don’t have to do shit. I’m not giving up this gig anytime soon, and all you fuckers just have to deal.” “Eight years simply isn’t enough time to do all the damage I aspire to do.” “I actually see no problem with a two-lifetime limit.”​ “There’s a sharp learning curve, and you don’t want a bunch of amateurs in here. For example, did you know that ‘yea’ means ‘yes’ and ‘nay’ means ‘no’? It’s not as simple as it looks.” “I will not respect anyone’s limits.” “An extremely elderly Senate makes me look even younger and hotter.” “Marco Rubio drives 90 through school zones. He will bring way more than 15 items to the express checkout line. Marco doesn’t care about your safe word—he’s gonna keep choking you until you black out. Limits are for losers, and Marco Rubio is a winner, baby.” “I’ve cut all the unemployment benefits I would have received if I lost this job.” “It’s an unpopular position, which is why I take it.” “My family sucks, and I don’t want to be forced to go home to them.” “You don’t want me out of the workforce with nothing but time on my hands.” “I can’t be out of a job. Who else is gonna hire ol’ Dicky Durbin? The post office? The shop down the street? I ain’t cut out for it! Please, this is all I’ve got. Don’t just take it away!” “I can no longer remember what I did before I became a senator, and I’m too embarrassed to ask at this point.” “You need a few terms to really get the hang of insider trading.” “If voters want to make the same terrible mistake over and over again, who are we to stop them?” “I have absolutely zero skills that would translate to any other job. If I worked in a factory, I would be swallowed by a wheat thresher almost immediately.” “You’re going to totally marginalize the voice of special interest groups.” “The people of Fair Haven elected a goat mayor as a joke, but once I tasted power, I knew I would never give it up. My totalitarian impulses know no bounds, and my reign will end over my cold dead hooves.” “I’m not too jazzed about any law that restricts things based on years.” “I’d rather die in the Senate than a nursing home.”"
White House Now Just Saying That Biden 52,N/A,https://www.theonion.com/white-house-now-just-saying-that-biden-52-1849900900,"WASHINGTON—Hoping to allay voters’ concerns about the president’s age, officials at the White House are now just saying that Joe Biden is 52 years old, sources confirmed Tuesday. “Americans have made it clear they want to see younger leadership in the White House, and they’re in luck, because President Biden is only 52,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters, adding that Biden had only turned 52 that morning, so he was a young 52. “2024 is right around the corner, and a fresh-faced, Gen X candidate like Joe Biden stands the best chance of firing up the youth vote with his hip perspectives and boyish charisma. It’s time to end America’s gerontocracy and pass the torch to a new generation of leaders, and by the time he starts his second term, President Biden will only be 47—the prime of his life! His white hair is just a dye job to make him look a little more mature. In fact, doctors say his brain and heart actually look more like a 30-year-old’s. Yes, there are definitely big things ahead for this 41-year-old rising star of the Democratic Party!” Jean-Pierre went on to suggest that while Biden’s youth gives him a strong polling edge in prospective 2024 matchups, he’ll likely have to find a new running mate to replace 106-year-old Kamala Harris."

But remember, you can only use a wild bill once, so make sure to think about strategy, especially if you have other bills on hand, like a mystery bill, or a steal bill, which lets you claim other people’s money.” At press time, the U.S. Treasury had further upped the stakes by saying the first U.S. citizen able to get rid of all their bills would win the Treasury’s entire gold reserve."

Thanks to this law, we can guarantee that no engineer driving 20,000 tons of freight across this great nation will be able to access healthcare without having their pay docked.” Biden went on to express confidence that next year, bipartisan legislation would be passed to ensure rail workers were no longer allowed to eat or sleep between shifts.

The blood that flows, softly, softly, as it runneth over the cup of humanity. I see the wretched masses roiled in blood, massive tsunamis of hot red blood crashing o’er the people of this country.

Now imagine that on a large scale, and you can see why I’m so angry.” “For the last time, there is absolutely no connection between me wanting violence against LGBTQ people and violence against LGBTQ people, and any suggestion that I want people to commit violence against LGBTQ people just because I want people to commit violence against LGBTQ people is absurd.” “I’m going to try to keep all of the right-wing House members underneath me happy by giving a thumbs-up but also frowning.” “It’s just nice to know my repeated call to arms to slaughter LGBTQ+ actually made a difference in the world.” “Whoever does the most anti-LGBTQ violence this year wins a $20 gift card for Starbucks.” “What about JFK? He got shot, and he was straight.” “One of my best guns is gay.” “Don’t blame this on my rhetoric when I don’t even know what’s coming out of my mouth half the time.” “I’ll watch girls do stuff together if that would help.” “If I had been there, I would have been able to stop the crazed combat veteran who intervened.” “No one should experience violence just because of who they love.

Martin Van Buren (1848): Van Buren hoped another term would  elevate him from a president nobody remembers to a president almost nobody remembers. Grover Cleveland (1892): Faced with the difficult choice of years of nothing but quality time with his family or being president again, he nobly ran and won. Teddy Roosevelt (1912): Needed something to do after hunting the world’s big game supply to extinction. Richard Nixon (1992): Nixon entered the race with a, “Come on, that was all a long time ago!” campaign slogan. Ronald Reagan (2000): A doddering Reagan announced his bid for the presidency to the condiments in his fridge. Donald Trump (2024): Reluctantly threw his hat in the ring when he could no longer resist the pleas of a party—and a nation—that needed him more than ever. Barack Obama (2200): Obamatron’s attempts to woo voters with his cybernetic implants will be widely seen as pandering to the mostly robotic American electorate."

I promise you, whatever porn I like on Sept. 11, I will attempt to hide the fact that I ever did it, denying it fervently and perhaps even blaming a junior staffer. But by then, several people will have already taken screenshots and shared it widely across the internet. You have my word.” Cruz went on to state that as with the last time he liked a porn post on Sept. 11, he planned to get off primarily on the public shaming, which he promised would cause him to ejaculate both forcefully and repeatedly."

As your senator, I hope to earn your trust and, eventually, your dark money.” At press time, Budd promised that regardless of political affiliation, his door was always open to anyone with a net worth over $500 million."

Those assholes didn’t even warn me first,” said Harris, who was furious after checking the paper schedule posted outside the chief of staff’s office and learning she had only been assigned three 8-hour shifts as vice president for the coming week. “This is such bullshit. It’s not like I like working here, but I need this fucking job! And it’s not like I can just go get a second job, because the schedule changes every week. Those complete dicks! They’re trying to push me out! I should have known this was going to happen when they refused to offer me a 401(k) even though all my aides have one.”  Harris added that the worst part was that she was scheduled to be vice president on Saturday night."

Honestly, I almost felt bad for the guy. It took him 45 minutes just to call his militia and ask if he should kill the guy in front of me for supposedly committing voter fraud.” At press time, Jenkins told reporters that he was ultimately just grateful he made it to work on time, because as he was leaving, the elderly poll watcher saw a Black voter, clutched his chest, and collapsed."

Based on registration numbers, I was expecting to terrorize hundreds of people well into the evening, not to mention thousands more who we were told would show up to try and vote illegally.

It’ll boost voter turnout and help folks rally around the DNC  platform. Hell, even if I’m not restored to the Oval Office, it will  help me personally and financially. So, yes, let me say it for the  record: Donald Trump and his corrupt lackeys stole the 2016 election  from me, and I would still be president if it weren’t for his meddling in  the vote count.” Upon seeing the positive reaction from die-hard  supporters, the 44th president went on to add that, sure, Michelle,  Sasha, and Malia are also still the president."

You’re telling me that Adonis of a senate candidate over there is Raphael Warnock? Are we talking about the same Raphael Warnock?’” said Quinnipiac University polling analyst Paul Minicus, who noted that the incumbent’s decision to remove his narrow, rectangular frames had, among other effects, led Democratic, Republican, and independent voters alike to crash their cars as they drove by him. “Eighty-one percent of those polled told us that when the senator took off his glasses it really opened up his face, allowing them to notice his beautiful eyes for the very first time, and 84 percent said he looked like a completely different person. With voters going to the polls tomorrow, this puts Warnock in a tough position, since he doesn’t want the votes of people who don’t like him for him.” At press time, reports confirmed Warnock had plunged in the polls after smiling to reveal  a full set of braces.  "
Things A Republican-Held Congress Plans To Do Immediately,N/A,https://www.theonion.com/things-a-republican-held-congress-plans-to-do-immediate-1849744650,"The Onion examines what the GOP will do without delay if a red wave in the midterms puts  Republicans in control of Congress. Republicans have set an intention to practice mindfulness as they deliver a final death blow to American democracy. Sunday talk shows, newspaper columns, the floor of Congress, wherever you look: There’s going to be so much goddamn whining. At long last, this undemocratic holdover from the slavery era will be done away with, along with the rest of the U.S. election system. Obviously white is their No. 1, but they’ll rank the ones after that too. Kevin McCarthy reportedly plans to stand at the podium, launch himself into the air, and do a full backflip while Democrats watch. They don’t like her, but she has experience. The upside to having incredibly conservative fiscal policies is that there’s not much more they can do. You get it. Though largely symbolic, impeachment would send a strong message against the Monster-In-Law star. It won’t all be bad. The longstanding tradition of Friday crab boils will return to Congress. It’s starting to smell. On Hunter Biden subpoena day, Republicans reportedly plan to get matching tattoos that will feature the date of the subpoena as well as an intricate drawing of Hunter Biden’s face. The old one has been on the fritz ever since Lindsey Graham took it home for the weekend. Republicans will finally go through with overthrowing the government, but now that they are in power, it will be them who will be dragged into the streets. We’re not sure that we, as a nation, can handle this. Whispers are already brewing among Republicans who plan on using their majority to vote for a catering company to bring in lunch that will invariably give Democrats violent food poisoning. It’s fucking filthy. The GOP has rightly taken issue with the Biden administration killing foreign civilians in airstrikes and causing mass starvation in Afghanistan by freezing its government assets, not to mention the brutal sanctions on—wait, no, it will be over some Marjorie Taylor Greene bullshit. Many Republican incumbents and candidates have voiced their support for the actor Johnny Depp and hope that by controlling Congress they will finally have enough clout to inspire a chill hang with Depp. No more chic dinnerware and stylishly placed flower arrangements once tasteful government spending falls under the purview of the GOP-dominated Congress. Gotta start somewhere!"
Things People Hate The Most About Democratic Fundraising Emails,N/A,https://www.theonion.com/things-people-hate-the-most-about-democratic-fundraisin-1849739142,"Whatever happens to Democrats this election, their unceasing disrespect for voters’ time, privacy, and intelligence prove they deserve it. Here are things people hate the most about Democratic fundraising emails. MoveOn doesn’t seem to give a fuck that you had surgery last week. There’s a reason why the Nigerian prince was so successful. Speaker Pelosi, watch your mouth. People are tired of accidentally deleting Barry’s game night thread while trying to clean up their inboxes. It’s starting to feel pretty one-sided. In addition to being annoying, a fundraising email causing your phone to ping as you cower in a closet while holding your breath is another reason to hate the Democrats. Oh, what the fuck? If there aren’t at least 10 in the subject line, who is even going to click? After losing everything to back McConnell’s 2020 challenger who never really had a shot, the last thing you want to see is another request for money. It takes a lot of time and effort to craft thoughtful responses. Americans would be far more likely to donate to Democrats if they promised most of it would go to Republicans. We would remember to donate if they asked more. Even if it does tug at your heartstrings, Democrats should think twice before sending you a photo of the beloved matriarch of your family in a hospital bed. This is not only ineffective but also tacky. Even though they always say it’s the last time, party leaders are always begging for more of your child’s freshly harvested adrenochrome. Though traditionally included in the first paragraph of all fundraising emails, many readers question whether this part is necessary. No tips on how to summon electricity from the sky, just Steny Hoyer asking for a quick buck. It’s annoying to sift through all the donation requests from random politicians to get to the expired coupons from random companies. You know what you have to do, so just do it."

This could be the last Election Day you can call America a democracy with a straight face.” At press time, spending on 2022 federal and state races was expected to reach a midterm record of $16.7 billion."

I’m still waiting for Donald Trump to say something really funny so I can repeat it at rallies to cover up for the fact that I’ve never had an original thought in my entire life.” “Finish the job.” “How do we know that Pelosi didn’t force that man into his home in order to bash his head against the man’s hammer?” “The event was both tragic and a real turn-on for me.” “I’m wishing him a speedy death.” “We put out an APB on the perp: South Asian female, about 7-foot-2, eye patch, curves in all the right places. Unfortunately, since it’s been more than 48 hours, we’ll probably never see Paul Pelosi again.” “This attack never would have happened if the hammer hadn’t been allowed across the border in the first place.” “Paul Pelosi? More like… Hold on, I’ll think of something. No, don’t leave! It’s on the tip of my tongue. I’m very funny, I promise!” “I wish she would have been home so that dumb bitch could get her entire face smashed in. Surprised, fuckers? I can say whatever I want, and you liberals still have to kiss my ass for as long as I live and beyond.” “I find it absolutely disgusting that Nancy Pelosi has a husband.” “Ann and I are praying for Mr. Pelosi’s swift conversion to Mormonism.” “The hypocrisy between those condemning the attack against Pelosi’s husband and the utter silence when I repeatedly bash my head into my desk is astounding.” “This clearly mentally ill man was nothing but a rogue actor who happened to listen to exactly what I’ve been secretly commanding him to do for months.” “I actually thought the hammer and zip ties were a nice change of pace from all the gun violence the other Republicans and I have been allowing.” “How many innocent people have to die before we realize that words do matter? Crazy people act on the crazy things they hear from politicians and celebrities. Oh shit, wait that was what I said on Fox after Steve Scalise got shot. Fuck. What I meant is that there is no connection between words and violence. Shit, shit, shit. Forget I said anything.” “I for one am inspired that a red-blooded American man can still get his tools and go to work.” “Now imagine for a moment that instead of Paul Pelosi, it was Ron DeSantis’ wife, and instead of a hammer, the assailant was a 20-foot-tall wolf man who blasted her out the window with a leaf blower. Now where’s the outrage over that?” “Some proud patriot should post bail for this guy so that he can also cave in my head with a hammer.” “It’s time to beef up security and protect the brave men and women who work hard every day to assassinate Democratic members of Congress.” “That hammer is a crisis actor. It even has a page on IMDB.”"

It was beyond reckless for this man to come to his attempted break-in armed with nothing but zip ties and rope. What terrible planning. Not even a pistol? Wouldn’t that have come in handy? And why are you asking where Nancy Pelosi is? You should known where she was beforehand, dipshit. Anyway, this is not the Republican Party I believe in. That Republican Party would have gotten this man to fully think through his tactics ahead of time so he could really knock the whole kidnapping Nancy Pelosi thing out of the park.” Republican officials added that this was a moment for their most fervent supporters to really reflect on the meaning of the phrase go big or go home."

Ann Selzer, explaining how the 37-term senator was forced to moderate his stance on returning to the gold standard in order to defeat Deadmore, who firmly opposed bullion-based currency and the resumption of specie payments. “In 1910, Grassley’s 14-hour filibuster against the Mann Act, which outlawed the trafficking of prostitutes, cost him dearly at the polls, but he remained Iowa’s senior senator. And this year, as long as voters look past his historic ties to railroad tycoons, he should be able to eke out a win.” At press time, Grassley’s campaign was reportedly in crisis mode after the senator’s youthful comments praising King George III came to light."

With this program, they will be alone no more, as we will assign them a like-minded, unstable mentor, who can teach them to write manifestos, threaten their peers, and effectively carry out a mass shooting with one of the world’s most dangerous firearms.” At press time, after a flood of interest, Abbott announced that Texas had extended the assault rifle program to troubled children as young as 5 years old."

Lee personally, and he made me a first lieutenant in the 63rd infantry. My opponent wants to defund the Confederate army. Well, he’ll have to get through my regiment first.

Most Controversial Medical Claims Made By Dr. Oz,N/A,https://www.theonion.com/most-controversial-medical-claims-made-by-dr-oz-1849706609,"The current GOP Senate candidate and former TV doctor has a long history of endorsing medical procedures that many have called “questionable” or “pseudoscience.” Here are the most controversial medical claims made by Dr. Mehmet Oz. Oz said he himself wore a bar of lavender soap on a chain around his neck to stop any bullet from penetrating his heart. Just because it works for him doesn’t mean it works for everyone. At this point, Dr. Oz was really just repeating things he heard on TV, like this iconic Red Bull slogan, and making serious medical claims about them. Any state-licensed physician like Oz should know that that round, juicy ass is absolutely perfect for those skintight pants. Ideally, according to Oz, the properties should be spread across at least four states with varying tax laws. While the Senate candidate might not publicly admit it, the human body grows hair in other places, too. Though not widely accepted in the medical community, this dangerous term has been adopted by his most loyal viewers. Everyone knows that the red Gatorade is the only one with healing powers. Longtime fans will never forget the episode in which Dr. Oz went on a 25-minute rant about how a body like that could never exist under God or science. When Dr. Oz invited Trump on his show in 2016, some were suspicious when he lauded the candidate’s trim, athletic build and his supposed ability to run a sub-four-minute mile. Oz has repeatedly claimed that the over 300 dogs he killed at Columbia University’s medical school were letting out yelps of sexual pleasure. Apparently they don’t teach all the bones at University Of Pennsylvania School of Medicine. Oz has repeatedly and dangerously stated that the stomach and most of the GI tract should be replaced in the event of even a small tummy ache. Doubling down on his recommendations for midlife cancer screenings, the doctor claimed that the only true way to prevent colon cancer was to build colonoscopies into your daily routine. Oz’s revised food pyramid was declared “legitimately odd” by the FDA. Actually, more rigorous, long-term studies are needed to confirm that raw coffee extract can strengthen your skill in the exquisite art of the open hand. While not technically a medical claim, this statement is complete bullshit. He is a television personality."

It doesn’t matter how long you’ve been in the country, whether you have family members here, what your education status is, or even where you are—you are legally eligible to become deported in a matter of weeks. As an extra incentive, those who sign up for our legal deportation program in the next 90 days can ensure that they’ll have access to the next plane out of here.” Jean-Pierre concluded the press conference by introducing three migrants who were using the program to deport themselves, adding that deportation is what makes America great."

Ron Johnson (R-WI) demonstrated he was tough on crime Thursday by hanging an accused bread thief in a Wisconsin town square. “All ye of good morals and fine virtue, gather now upon the village green and watch as this despicable young man faces the gallows for his brazen theft of a loaf of bread,” said Johnson, claiming the 11-year-old must face the ultimate punishment for allegedly stealing what appeared to be a crust of sourdough. “Pilfering the wares of a law-abiding baker is a wanton act of criminality and must be met with force, lest others of questionable character begin to think they may do the same. Let his decapitated head be placed upon a pike so that all ye who attend the farmers market held here every other Saturday remember what we do to wicked scofflaws in the state of Wisconsin.” After carrying out the execution, Johnson was reportedly informed by witnesses that the bread had come free with a meal the boy’s family had ordered at a nearby restaurant."

Where would I be today if I had received the years of intensive psychiatric care I almost certainly needed? You can hardly expect to make it in Washington if you receive adequate treatment for your narcissistic or antisocial personality disorder.” At press time, McCarthy had introduced a bill to equip public schools with bigger cracks in the system for aspiring young sociopaths to slip through."

Even if you put a bill on the floor mandating that every American had to suck my dick and give me $200 after, I would still vote against it.” “I think counting numbers is a made-up crock of shit that liberals invented.” “For so many years, I’ve wanted to see my brother killed by lunatic extremists. This is still my best chance.” “Being president shouldn’t be as easy as convincing everyone to vote for you. You should also have to imprison hundreds of violent militiamen who swarm the Capitol to kill you.” “I think it’s a sort of meaningless piece of legislation that doesn’t really address the underlying issues surrounding election integrity. Also, it still allows Black people to vote.” “The less votes are counted, the better my chance to be elected to higher office.” “I don’t know. Why does anyone do anything? Get off my fucking back.” “Everyone else must suffer as much as I, a man whose name sounds like knockoff salad dressing.” “I really want MTG to start calling me Bud Light so that it will catch on with the others, so I vote for whatever she does.” “I don’t know. I just look at whichever way the person next to me is voting and vote the same.” “Gohmie naughty!” “I thought the idea of electoral count reform was cockamamy back when I voted against it in 1887, and I still think it’s nonsense now!” “Because if it all breaks right in 2024, guess who’s gonna be president? That’s right, Mark Amodei.” “If my 17-year-old girlfriend’s vote doesn’t count, neither should anyone else’s.” “I didn’t want it to go forward because I don’t think that a bill on voting rights should get decided by something as undemocratic as the Senate.” “Wait, they record how we vote? Fuck! My constituents are going to be pissed.” “If you’ve read the entire bill, you know that it contains a lot of words, which made me tired and bored, so I voted nay.” “I have a special coin I keep in my desk. It has Thomas Jefferson on it. Whenever I have to cast a vote on a bill, I flip the coin. Heads is yea; tails is nay. People think I’m super conservative, but I’m not. Every decision I make is based on the coin, including the decision to never walk again. I love my coin.” “I couldn’t make the last Capitol riot, but I’m really hoping I get an invite for the next one.” “There aren’t enough frustrating ambiguities and loopholes in the presidential certification process to begin with, so I will be introducing my own bill to add a few wrinkles.” “The founding fathers designed our voting system to be so incredibly flawed that it is easy to exploit and manipulate, and it is our duty to keep it that way.” “Oh, is that what I was voting on?”"

Do you see how it  still beats?’ as he grew increasingly pale and weak from blood loss. I  really believe we nipped the whole thing in the bud by the time he  collapsed onstage.” At press time, the campaign reportedly responded to  a follow-up question about Fetterman’s stroke by sending aides to saw  open the skull of the unconscious candidate."

I’ve claimed the 2020 presidential election was stolen, ignoring the fact that I won reelection on the same ballot. I honestly don’t know what else I can do.

How old are they?” “Our community has risen up to put together about two weeks of goodwill for these migrants.” “I have an empty 17-bedroom Victorian not yet on the market—have they been preapproved for a loan yet?” “I just wish there were some way to house these migrants within our gigantic luxury homes that are vacant most of the year.” “Great, now we have to send a thank-you note.” “I worry the migrants won’t be able to appreciate my lobster gratin. I bet they don’t even know their way around a lobster fork. Oh, how I hate them and their small ways!” “If Ron DeSantis keeps this up, I’m going to have to reduce my campaign contributions to him from $10,000 to $9,950.” “I can fit 25 if they sleep vertically.” “It’s perfect timing. I’ve just run out of moving targets for my clients to practice on.” “DeSantis should have asked to use my plane before dropping $12 million on this stupid stunt.” “Impossible. The gate attendant would  never have let them in.” “Yes, of course we’ll take them in. My charity group keeps calling me selfish, and this is the perfect thing to shove in their faces at the next gala.” “I wish he’d let us know ahead of time which airline he’d be using so I could go long on their stock.” “Dumping these people here with no food, no water, and no plan is unspeakably cruel.

And don’t act like it’s any different because he used planes instead of buses! I want the credit. I want voters to know this whole method of completely wrecking immigrants’ lives  was my brainchild.” Reached for comment, DeSantis said he only resorted to the political stunt after he first floated an idea to separate migrant children from their parents and put them in cages, a plan that led to him receiving a cease-and-desist letter from Donald Trump’s attorneys."

I love all of the candidates equally.” “It seems like magic. And the only magic I support is from a magician named Christ.” “My book club tried ranked-choice. We ended up reading The Goldfinch, and it sucked.” “I don’t see any point in it. Typically, Donald Trump only endorses one candidate per election.” “Knowing that people could rank me last would hurt my feelings.” “It’s a time-honored American tradition to make high-speed uninformed decisions and be forced to live with the consequences.” “Voting shouldn’t be turned into a game that favors the few, unless those few are also Republicans.” “To be honest, I’m not all that crazy about regular-choice voting.” “Where does the vote go after you vote it?

Congressman William Lawrence introduces a bill to create a Department of Justice with the sole aim of illegally investigating Donald J. Trump. Trump exits White House with classified documents after mistaking them for his personal nuclear information. Trump instructs White House movers to be extra careful with boxes labeled “CLASSIFIED.” Barron Trump begins using a nuclear launch code as his Xbox gamertag.

Trump refuses FBI entry to Mar-a-Lago in effort to preserve proper dude-to-chick ratio. For several hours, Eric Trump excitedly stands outside FBI surveillance van parked near Mar-a-Lago waiting for ice cream man to open.

FBI returns to Mar-a-Lago after hearing there were more desserts at the dessert station than previously stated. FBI specialized plumbing division called in to confiscate over nine toilets’ worth of sensitive information. One Republican voter flips.

Trump condemns investigators for entering room clearly marked “No FBI Allowed.” Justice Department’s entire case on verge of collapse after Trump declares he did absolutely nothing wrong. Archaeologists uncover 5,000 additional boxes of classified documents preserved on former site of Mar-a-Lago golf course."

You know that? A full-on rapist. Dick out and everything. That’s what you are. Voting systems lawsuit? Is that some code for ‘I’m a rapist’? Seems an awful lot like it is.” “Aw, nuts! You caught us!

Spreading lies about the voting systems not working was the compromise, okay? The top brass at Fox News originally wanted us to spread the rumor that the voting machines turned every American voter into a trans pedophile supersoldier in the Democratic Party army, but we hosts talked them down to just making totally false claims about the machines malfunctioning. And this is the thanks we hosts get.” “I’ve never even heard of this ‘voting’ you’re referring to.” “It’s insulting, disgusting, and downright un-American that I be held accountable for something as meaningless as words.” “In all my years as a guy who sits in front of a television prompter and repeats exactly what it says, I never in my life look angry, blink, blink again, beat fist on table, blink, blink again, get as red as possible, beat fist on table.” “Gutfeld!

Raphael Warnock, GOP challenger Herschel Walker was reportedly brushing up on theoretical physics and linguistics Friday in order to formulate the ideal conditions for a contest with his rival. “I don’t want to leap into a debate without first ensuring that an optimized set of variables will apply, both in terms of the formal assumptions implicit in my opponent’s rhetorical constructions and in terms of how, at a subatomic level, the phenomenon of quantum entanglement will dictate the event’s proceedings,” Walker said before taking to a whiteboard to diagram computational neural networks that he described as part of an effort to establish a rough framework for a theory of verbal cognition that could, hypothetically, be used to predict Warnock’s debate tactics. “I just need time for a refresher on lexical-functional grammar so I can better understand how syntactical structure relates to the morphology and semantics of language development in human societies. Then I should be able to calculate all possible arguments and counterarguments that, when viewed through the discursive model within which we’re operating, could posit effective strategies for connecting with voters.” Walker added that he hadn’t gone this deeply into these topics since he made a name for himself in the 1980s as a particle physicist at CERN."

Meanwhile, those who have unpaid student debt will be given $10,000 and an unlimited supply of grenades to toss into random houses in affluent areas.” According to reports, Biden ended the press conference by taking out a gun and shooting every member of the White House press corps who appeared old enough to have paid back their college loans.

The vice president then reportedly exchanged glances with a visibly confused Education Secretary Miguel Cardona, giving him a silent thumbs-up before crossing her arms and nodding seriously at the cameras. According to reports, Harris slowly retreated out of the frame after the final photograph was taken and left as silently as she came."

The Onion asked conservatives why they are preparing for a civil war, and this is what they said. “We have no choice. The Constitution clearly states that the South shall rise again.” “It would just be nice to have a civil war we could teach about and not bring up slavery.” “I recently killed someone, and if the war comes soon enough, I’m hoping it can just get lumped in.” “Um, something about George Soros and immigrants or—hold on, I have it written down somewhere.” “I feel like carnage on a national scale might shake things up a little.” “It’s either prepare for a civil war or try to get out there and date again.” “I’ve got some vacation days saved up.” “It’d help me get my steps in.” “If I’ve learned one thing from watching the modern Democratic Party operate, it’s that they’re an uncompromising faction working in perfect harmony, and they’ll do anything to accomplish their goals.” “Not really sure. I’ll probably just do it until the NFL regular season starts.” “Oh, this isn’t for a civil war. I’ve always had this many guns.” “Just because you fantasize over something so much it becomes your entire personality doesn’t mean you want it to happen.” “You can only bomb so many Middle Eastern countries before you eventually start bombing your own.” “When I was a child, the government forced me to learn to read, and I can’t unlearn that. That’s tyranny.” “If regular war is good for the economy, a civil war must be twice as good.” “I’m rock hard just thinking about the profit we’d make.” “My ratings have been way up. So that’s not a great sign.” “We need new statues.” “It’s just easier to go to war again than take down my Confederate flag.” “I really don’t see any solution to this other than us getting killed by the government.”"

Greg Abbott, adding that registered gun owners would need to take yearly exams to confirm they routinely threaten people’s lives, fantasize about murder, and actively wish to do harm against others or themselves. “Henceforth, no individual without a history of psychopathy or violence against women, children, or marginalized groups will be allowed to purchase automatic or semiautomatic weapons. And if they do not have an unsecured, unlocked area to store their gun, they will not be granted a license.” At press time, Abbott added that the state had passed further regulations requiring that anyone who had been reported to be planning a mass shooting of any kind be given complimentary ammunition and firearms."

I am also requesting an emergency 500,000 pounds of debris and rubble be airdropped throughout the affected areas. Congress must act to complete the destruction of these communities while we still can.

Biggest Revelations From Josh Hawley’s New Book ‘Manhood’,N/A,https://www.theonion.com/biggest-revelations-from-josh-hawley-s-new-book-manhoo-1849356408,"Controversial Missouri Senator Josh Hawley is releasing a new book titled Manhood: The Masculine Virtues Americans Need as a defense of masculinity and its role in American democracy. While the book won’t be released for nearly a year, The Onion was able to secure an early draft. Here are the biggest revelations in Manhood. His former classmates noticed his cowardice even back  then. Women are trying to destroy the beloved male traits of  violence and misogyny. The one quantifiable  measure of masculinity is how strongly you can resist passing gun  control reform in the face of weekly massacres of school children.  The book centers on life in the slow country town of Hawley’s youth. “No one has done  more damage to American masculinity than Olaf,” Hawley writes. “He is  made of snow. He will never be a real man.”  So don’t waste your time looking. Sexism, plain and dry.  Explaining his  opposition to ObamaCare, Hawley argues testosterone is a natural remedy for  any ailment. Sprinkle salt around your bed at dusk to ward off these  harpies. Most of the  book is just the words “placeholder” and “Josh Hawley TK” repeated in  different fonts. The number of adverbs and  split infinitives that distract from any erotic content is one thing.  But phrases like “sweatily fumbling ball of limbs” are barely  comprehensible, let alone titillating. Does an endorsement  from the master of suspense really mean anything at this point?  Several chapters are devoted  to penis size, penis length, penis girth, penis area, penis agility,  penis responsiveness, penis resilience, and penis decorum. He repeatedly  stresses that he is fine but not especially thrilled with representing  the mediocre people of Missouri. The Missouri senator goes on to argue that 7 is  “actually quite good” and “far above average for the typical U.S.  female.” Obviously not expecting anyone to make it  that far in the book, the last couple chapters are just rambling  observations about his favorite shapes and colors.  Appropriate: A blonde bison, breasts  oozing apple pie filling, a nun in a cowboy hat. Inappropriate: Two  robots kissing. And he’s not going to, no matter how much his  wife begs because he’s the head of the household.  If there’s any money left after that, he’s going to get  limb-lengthening surgery too. Chapter 12 details how  floored he remains that his Democratic colleagues are too cowardly to  hold him accountable for clearly seditious acts. "

We know it’s a lot of responsibility, what with toppling foreign governments and holding other countries hostage with sanctions and so forth, but we really feel like we’re up to the task. Obviously, there are other countries like China and India that seem interested as well, but we feel like Estonia is a nice non-controversial pick to control global fortunes and lead humanity into the, dare we say, Estonian Century? Now we’re just wondering who we speak to about this—do we ask the U.N.? We also have this idea for the E9, which is a group of nine global leaders run by Estonia. Anyway, it would be an honor to be considered, and honestly, if America can do it, it really can’t be that hard.” Estonian officials added that they would be happy to shadow America for a few months to gain some hands-on experience with being the global superpower while America continued to phase itself out of the role."

Dianne here started off as a Goldwater Republican, then steadily matured into an evangelical theocrat, and actually was among the first senators to endorse Donald Trump for president—or at least that’s what she told me earlier, didn’t you?

Normal smart people don’t go around stepping on land mines.” “As one of the top recipients of Saudi money in the Senate, I’m not interested in any bill that doesn’t place Saudi veterans’ healthcare first.”  “I really just wanted to feel something. Anything.” “I heard that the injuries they got in the burn pits means some of these veterans can’t even have children.

I’d like to see our veterans take some personal responsibility for your injuries for once.” “My father never gave me treatment for exposure to toxic materials growing up, and I turned out just fine.”"
China Threatens To Retaliate For Pelosi’s Taiwan Trip By Letting Her Return Safely,N/A,https://www.theonion.com/china-threatens-to-retaliate-for-pelosi-s-taiwan-trip-b-1849343979,"BEIJING—Warning the United States that the House Speaker would be spared, China reportedly threatened to retaliate Thursday for Nancy Pelosi’s trip to Taiwan by letting her return safely. “Should Nancy Pelosi follow through with her planned trip to Taiwan, China will be forced to take the hostile measure to weaken America by allowing her to return unscathed,” said President Xi Jinping, warning that any move by Pelosi to legitimize the Taiwanese regime would be met with a first class ticket back so that she is well-rested and ready to return to legislative matters. “The folly of America’s intransigence on China’s territorial claims will be be made clear when Ms. Pelosi is permitted to set foot back on U.S. soil and continue to shape national policy. We have the entire might of the Chinese military standing by ready to defend Ms. Pelosi from any possible threat.” At press time, Chinese leadership was tested in their resolve to keep Pelosi alive after hearing her speak."

I just want people to suffer.” “Trying to codify gay marriage is a waste of time that would only distract us from the real issues, like putting those gay people in forced labor camps. “While I had a fantastic time at my son’s same-sex wedding last week, he’s still a horrible abomination that should be put to death.” “As a Christian, I strongly believe that love has no place in marriage.” “One time I googled up ‘penis sword-fighting’ and got a virus so bad I needed to get a new computer.” “I’m disgusted by the thought of anyone being happy.” “Is a country where gay marriage is legal really the kind of country I want to leave to my son, whom I want to have sex with and ultimately marry?” “I wasn’t invited to my gay friend’s wedding. This is payback, Mateo!” “It plays well in focus groups.” “If we allow same-sex marriage, what’s next? A tree that gets abortions? A Marxist camel from California that commits incest? A kind of pill that turns all semen into gay Barbies? Absolutely not.” “Children can’t get married anyway, so what’s the point?” “Marriage was only meant for heterosexual, abusive relationships.” “Marriage should be between a man and a woman who are disgusted by each other’s physical forms so much that they must force arousal on themselves every time they are required to procreate.” “Scripture teaches us that marriage should only be between a man and a woman and a woman and a woman and a woman.” “It has no place in a healthy, functioning theocracy.” “I think of penis all day and I think of how no penis should go near other penis.

Jan. 6 Panel Finds Over 200 Congresspeople Hooked Up Believing They Were About To Die,N/A,https://www.theonion.com/jan-6-panel-finds-over-200-congresspeople-hooked-up-be-1849320899,"WASHINGTON—As evidence continues to emerge regarding the actions of U.S. lawmakers during the 2021 attack on the Capitol, the House Jan. 6 committee unveiled Friday new findings that confirm more than 200 members of Congress hooked up during the riot because they believed they were about to die. “With rioters occupying the Capitol and hellbent on violence, senators and representatives feared for their lives, and we now know that scores of them spent the riot seeking comfort in each other’s arms and experiencing sex one last time,” said committee chair Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-MS), who recounted his own panic-fueled sex with a  congresswoman he declined to name in the office where they were both hiding, and then showed a video of Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) sprinting through the Capitol in an effort to find one last sexual partner before the rioters killed them all. “Testimony from those present during the attack, corroborated in some cases by photographic and video evidence, reveals that dozens of desperate lawmakers decided to consummate long-held infatuations with members of the opposite party, while others simply went at it with whichever congressperson was closest at hand. Some of the more conclusive evidence of this collective move into dread-fueled sexual promiscuity includes Sen. Joni Ernst (R-IA) shouting ‘If this is really the end, then fuck it, do what you want’; Rep. Tom O’Halleran (D-AZ) leading a group of representatives on a hunt for condoms; and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) shaking Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) to get a hold of himself before leading him into her office. The scale of the fear is evident in the fact that few of them took party, age, or even gender into account, so desperate were these members of Congress to experience one last moment of erotic bliss before the slaughter.” The committee then showed a previously unaired video of screaming throughout the halls of Congress slowly turning into lustful moans and sustained cries of pleasure.

State Department Brokers Alliance In Destabilized Region By Providing Arms To Texan Warlords,N/A,https://www.theonion.com/state-department-brokers-alliance-in-destabilized-regio-1849089093,"WASHINGTON—Calling the arrangement necessary to achieve long-term success in the volatile region, State Department officials announced Wednesday that they had managed to broker a key alliance in the failed Southwestern state of Texas by providing arms to local warlords. “The lack of stable institutions has left innocent Texans devastated by constant power outages, horrific maternal mortality rates, and skyrocketing illiteracy—we don’t agree with these warlords on everything, but strengthening their hold on the area through strategic weapons shipments is frankly our best shot at bringing Texas some semblance of functioning governance,” said Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who noted that while the State Department’s new allies undeniably held backward attitudes toward women and extreme religious beliefs, such views were sadly too commonplace in that part of the world to be avoided. “You have to understand that Texas has long been a lawless, violent place, where corrupt local police force residents to fend for themselves while maintaining a facade of order through frequent, oftentimes arbitrary executions. Sending these warlords Stinger missiles and towed artillery systems will let them fill that power vacuum in the places where they aren’t the de facto authority already, and once they consolidate their rule, we can use our influence to promote peace, better educational opportunities, and, perhaps one day, democracy.” Insisting that the government’s interests in Texas were purely humanitarian, Blinken dismissed allegations that the U.S. was only intervening to secure the region’s vast fossil fuel deposits."

However, any concerns we had about the president’s condition were  immediately dismissed early this morning when the staff heard the  sensual moans of both him and the first lady coming from inside the  Lincoln Bedroom. Let me put an end to any speculation here: President  Biden is clearly still in his sexual prime.” Jean-Pierre then confirmed  this particular sexual act consisted of 17 total pumps and ended  at 8:03 a.m. before concluding the press conference without questions."

In addition, approximately half of Democratic voters expressed interest in seeing a younger woman or a person of color piloting Biden’s limbs and using his voice to speak their own words during the 2024 campaign.” According to the poll, most Democrats, when pressed, acknowledged that if the party failed to “put someone younger in there,” they would support the hollow, empty husk of Joe Biden running for president.

The whole plan in 2020 was to take back the White House with Biden and then the next time around—after he had fallen and broken a hip or suffered a massive stroke or flatlined on live TV in the middle of a big speech—nominate someone Democrats actually like. But unfortunately, it’s looking more and more like the president will still be breathing and have the cognitive functioning needed to put his name on the ballot one more time. This is a complete disaster.” The source went on to state that several Cabinet-level officials were considering broaching the subject directly with the president to gauge his interest in passing away sooner rather than later."

I’ve instructed our team to check in on him regularly, just to make light small talk and remind him that this is all temporary, so there’s definitely no reason to act rashly and permanently enact any meaningful reform that can’t be undone when he’s feeling better. The president’s mental well-being is of our chief concern right now, and we are dedicated to making sure that doesn’t lead him down a slippery slope to passing any mental healthcare initiatives.” At press time, a tearful Biden had to be talked down from signing an executive order to exonerate anyone left in prison for marijuana."

The research also found that 87% of those polled would strongly prefer that when Joe Biden attempts to speak only ash emanates from his mouth and his jaw falls off and shatters on the floor.” At press time, York confirmed that the survey found that Biden’s approval rating would significantly improve if a strong wind caused him to crumble into dust."

We could probably start off with some meet-and-greets so that everyone gets a chance to say a little bit about themselves and what they’d like to accomplish in a Biden administration. Maybe some of them even have thoughts on how things have been going so far, which I would certainly be interested in hearing. Ultimately, though, I don’t want to force people to sit in a room just to sit in a room, and if it doesn’t feel like we’re going to have a productive cabinet meeting, we can probably just give it a rain check and meet some other time.” Biden added that along with his first cabinet meeting, he had recently begun mulling over the idea of calling a couple senators he hadn’t spoken to in a while to find out what was happening over in Congress."

I’m respectfully asking you to give me the same distance I’ve given you. While there are things I will always cherish about our time together, I don’t like hearing you say I was the best you’ve ever had. You need to learn how to figure things out on your own without me.” The 44th president then added that because he thought it was best America hear it from him first, he wanted the nation to know he had been spending more time with France."

Last week, I was stuck behind him for 20 minutes while he tried to back out of the parking lot.” At press time, a police boot had been placed on Buttigieg’s locomotive for several unpaid parking tickets.

Someone who’s 150 years old.” “Well, he does have that incumbent advantage of being battered nonstop in the media.” “I’m technically not allowed to say this, but he isn’t even fit to be in office now.” “Hopefully, legislative maps have been gerrymandered enough to make whoever is running for president not matter.” “Sure!

Biggest Republican Talking Points To Downplay January 6,N/A,https://www.theonion.com/biggest-republican-talking-points-to-downplay-january-6-1849048460,"As the House committee on the Jan. 6 insurrection continues its public hearings, Republicans are scrambling to shift the blame away from themselves. Here are the biggest talking points the GOP is using to downplay the Capitol riots. Not like Congress was being ransacked all over the country. The politicians on the right truly believe the highly coordinated effort was just the classic case of 2,500 lone wolves with an agenda. Republicans want to remind you that these insurrectionists had no intention of harming Mike Pence and were simply looking for a hanger with which to air-dry their wet clothes. The mob made sure they stormed the Capitol only when destruction was specifically permitted. Just think of what the Capitol would’ve looked like if so-called rioters dropped a bomb as powerful as a million tons of TNT. They might actually have a point there. It’s not like they tried to stop a presidency people were excited about. Blaming the insurrection on a bunch of 13-year-olds visiting the monuments is a risky move the Republicans are willing to take. This is a pretty factually sound argument. This is immediately undermined by the Democrats’ complete inability to orchestrate anything. Many aren’t even able to stand on their own two feet. If it’s not on the calendar, it’s impossible to prove. Even all of the really, really old senators survived. CGI technology really is incredible. That neoclassical eyesore has been begging for vandalism for centuries. Makes a lot of sense when you look at it from their point of view. Democrats are willfully ignoring the real issue, which is that January has 30 days besides Jan. 6. Really, we should be grateful they pointed out some vulnerabilities in our system. In their defense, every building in this dumb city is made out of white stone. Whoops. Politicians usually just think this one. Succinct, but 100% to the point. It’s true, whatever is still to come will certainly be much worse and more worthy of criminal prosecution. Can’t argue with that!"
Politician Supports Right Of Protesters To Assemble Anywhere SUV Can Plow Through Them,N/A,https://www.theonion.com/politician-supports-right-of-protesters-to-assemble-any-1848923027,"WASHINGTON—In response to the continuing debate over the ethics of public demonstration, Rep. Lyle Goodrich (R-CA) told reporters Wednesday that he supports the right of protesters to assemble anywhere an SUV can plow through them. “Americans absolutely have the right to make their voices heard in public spaces where an SUV could easily gain speed and mow down a whole group,” said Goodrich, adding that being able to ram a full-size SUV into a crowd of demonstrators was a vital American tradition that he would stop at nothing to protect. “Freedom of assembly means that U.S. citizens have the right to have their arms, legs, and skulls pinned under the tires of a large pickup truck, or even a mid-size sedan. The founders are very clear on the right to assemble anywhere a 5,000-pound vehicle can take out a dozen in a single maniac burst, and the First Amendment protects your right to make your voice heard while shouting from the wheel well of an Escalade. Whether it’s a march, a gathering outside an official’s home, or a candlelight vigil, if you can drive an SUV into the crowd and run over a hundred people within seconds, I support it.” Goodrich added that he is also a staunch supporter of letting protesters demonstrate within the crosshairs of a law enforcement sniper’s gun."

Lauren Boebert (R-CO), who slammed the all-ages shows as “immoral” and “perverse,” stating that she was deeply disturbed that any parent would take a child under 18 to a place where adults stood on stages and wore sequined, eye-catching clothing. “It’s completely inappropriate to take a young child to a show where people are reveling in the limelight. These poor children will only be confused, asking themselves, ‘Wait, if I lip-sync, can I get people to look at me too?’ It’s bad enough that Britney Spears’ choreography is freely available on YouTube for kids to memorize.” At press time, Boebert was calling for a ban on dancing in the presence of minors.

Greg Abbott, who added that the 24-hour waiting period, which would begin the moment dispatchers received their first 911 call, would help police be “100% certain” that protecting the public was prudent. “Before rushing into a school or church to stop a massacre, police will be required to wait a full 24 hours, never acting a minute sooner.

This plan appears to have been in the works for the past two years, with Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) agreeing to be the fall guy.” According to the report, the arrangement with the bookie also included an unspoken understanding that if the Democrats still  retained control of Congress after the midterms, their party leaders would be “fish food.”"

As they cling to a crumbling precipice, they reach out, in their desperation, to the one man whose whims control their destiny: to me, to their protector, to New York’s greatest benefactor, to Eric Adams!” At press time, sources reported Adam had retired for the night to his apartment in New Jersey."

I’ve been wanting to do this forever, and I’m so rarely in the area—in fact, it’s half the reason I agreed to attend this in person. Don’t get me wrong, I care about the urgent issues at hand, but right now I am needed at a variety of sampling stations around the city to experience the sweet, creamy sensations of Belgian chocolate. I have an idea—why don’t you all come with? It’s only like 35 bucks a pop. But promise—no shop talk when there’s chocolate present.” At press time, sources confirmed NATO members had agreed to call it a day after unilaterally signing off on an agreement to send Ukraine a box of truffles.

We will welcome Ukrainians escaping the violence with the warm bed just vacated by some Hispanic guy we captured and sent back to Mexico. It is important in this tragic moment that we support European—and only European—refugees and asylum-seekers.” Biden added that the United States reserved the right to deport the Ukrainian refugees if asylum-seekers from a more Western country came along."

There are some concerns from advisors that a transition to high approval ratings and strong support from the American people goes against the normal Democratic brand, but we think it might be worth a chance.” At press time, sources reported the administration had decided to back down from pivoting to a good presidency due to growing anxiety about the spending that would entail."

The Onion looks at the leading potential replacements for Justice Breyer. Anita Earls: Appointing a Black woman who will be constantly overruled by white people would make the court more representative of America. Jimmy Carter: Putting the 97-year-old former president on the court would ensure it has a strong new liberal voice for weeks to come. Ketanji Brown Jackson: The accomplished D.C. Circuit judge has everything Democrats could want for attorney general in 2027. Amal Clooney: Licensed to practice law in the U.S. and the U.K., Clooney could bring an international point of view as well as some much-needed star power to the bench. Jay Inslee: Sure, he’s not Black, and he’s not a woman, but apart from that, nominating him would be a perfect way to fulfill Biden’s pledge to put a Black woman on the Supreme Court. Kamala Harris: Would give the current VP an avenue to become unpopular in a third branch of government.

Moving on from there, getting to her torso would be a cherry on top. If we’re ambitious, we might actually get through her entire circulatory system. That’d be a huge win for progressives and moderates alike. But let’s cross that bridge when we get to it.” Senate moderates also pointed out the precedent of Republicans putting Justice Sandra Day O’Connor’s floating head onto the Supreme Court in 1981."

It’s also important to note that the president will not be able to coast on the popularity of his running mate, either, should he mount a reelection campaign: More than 60 percent of horses completely rebuffed a photo of Kamala Harris when presented with an apple core.” At press time, Biden’s favorability had reportedly skyrocketed after pollsters began burying his photo in a stack of sugar cubes.

U.S. Democracy Under Siege After Tech Lobbyist Invites Some Senators To Dinner,N/A,https://www.theonion.com/u-s-democracy-under-siege-after-tech-lobbyist-invites-1848302748,"WASHINGTON—In what both ordinary citizens and experts agreed was a threat to the nation’s political system, American democracy  reportedly came under siege Thursday after a tech lobbyist invited some senators to dinner. “Rarely do we see such a brazen attack on our democratic values, and yet we could only watch in  shock and horror as a paid representative for several biotech firms entered Charlie Palmer Steak with three U.S. senators for a sumptuous five-course meal,” said political scientist Monica Turley, adding that the vicious assault on representative self-government was compounded by the fact that U.S. intelligence officials had done nothing to address it, despite records showing that the dinner reservation had been in place for months. “Only in a country where democracy is in  real danger could we see the lobbyist for a private interest discussing wine pairings with sitting members of Congress. What’s even more frightening is how shameless this attempt on our democracy was: Any passerby could have seen these individuals openly plotting how they would split up the seared foie gras and heirloom tomato salad. Ultimately, we may look back at the dinner of Jan. 6, 2022, as the beginning of the complete breakdown of the contract between the government and its people.” Political experts were at a loss for how to address this blatant threat to democracy, adding that virtually no one in any U.S. government institution seemed capable of doing anything to prevent the group from ordering dessert."
Critics Warn Biden’s Plan To Remove Lead Pipes Would Put Millions Of Potential Murder Weapons In Circulation,N/A,https://www.theonion.com/critics-warn-biden-s-plan-to-remove-lead-pipes-would-pu-1848228810,"WASHINGTON—Denouncing the Biden administration’s plan to replace every lead pipe in the nation’s water systems, critics warned Thursday that such an initiative would put millions of potential murder weapons into circulation across American cities. “The president is proposing a dangerous new government program that would place deadly weapons in the hands of violent criminals,” said Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR), adding that while the reduction of drinking water toxicity was a noble goal on paper, once the estimated 6 to 10 million pipes were no longer in use as mains and service lines, the increased availability of metal bludgeons would push homicide rates to record highs.  “It’s completely reckless and irresponsible to be giving out free murder weapons in the name of environmental safety. What good is safe drinking water if American families can’t walk down the street without getting their heads bashed in by a pipe-wielding thug? Lead pipes must remain safely below the ground.” Cotton later clarified that he still supported the constitutional right of law-abiding citizens to carry lead pipes in public and beat people to death in self-defense."

They’ll give the Black children the melody and stick the white children with the harmony. The next thing you know they’ll be adding dance moves, and then there’s no coming back—our children are gone.” At press time, Vos also warned the loophole would allow for schools to teach critical race theory through painting, Play-Doh, and crafting paper mobiles."

You’re saying I should be brushing every single night, and I’m responding that this is a clear misreading of history,” said the combative Psaki, who firmly pushed back on what she described as a “lack of context” that prevented her dentist from seeing a significant rise in flossing since her previous visit. “If you’re just going to interrupt me every few seconds to tell me to ‘close and spit’ and peddle long-debunked hearsay about possible cavities then I’m sorry, I’m not going to take any of these invasive and highly personal questions about whether I use mouthwash. This isn’t constructive and you know it isn’t what a routine cleaning is about.” At press time, Psaki had stormed out of the office after her dentist demanded she let him take a few follow-up x-rays."

Why would you want a Slavic country anyway? You’re already a Slavic country; it makes no sense. Honestly, I doubt if they would put up much of a fight.

Abortion Laws In Every State,N/A,https://www.theonion.com/abortion-laws-in-every-state-1848157845,"The Onion provides in-depth coverage of how female reproductive rights are mangled, mutilated, and butchered at the state level.

Though broadly legal, it is against the law to administer abortions by throwing women into a volcano. Abortions are illegal unless the Great Potato gives express permission. Abortion is one of the few things in Illinois that actually doesn’t make sense to get done for cheaper in Indiana. State law requires an ultrasound to be projected on the Jumbotrons of all major sporting events before terminating the pregnancy.

Oh, that’s good—I’ll put that I ‘used my organizational and problem-solving skills to help others facilitate the achievement of key objectives.’ That could mean anything. And I can say, ‘Worked in close proximity to the president.’ That’s technically correct, because the Oval Office is just around the corner and down the hall a ways. ‘Reliable’ is accurate—I’m on time every morning, and then I’m right here, sitting at this desk, the whole day.” According to reports, Harris went on to complete the self-assessment’s future goals section by writing that she plans to “continue asking for more high-profile assignments” and to “be prepared to take on more important duties as soon as they are assigned to me.” "

What does the word ‘country’ even mean if you can do that? Also, Canada is part of British Commonwealth, right? So does that mean I’m in charge of Canada? Or  did that change after the Brexit thing?

Most Insidious Ways Politicians Have Curtailed U.S. Voting Rights,N/A,https://www.theonion.com/most-insidious-ways-politicians-have-curtailed-u-s-vot-1848077171,"Nothing makes your vote more useless than allowing some uniformed dimwit who sheepishly does whatever he is told to vote for the opposite party from you. On average almost 10 million Americans are turned away at the polls using this widespread suppression tactic. Many waiting outside their polling place don’t even know they’ve been disenfranchised until they’re being cuffed and read their Miranda rights by the officer at the front of the line. Telling you that you have the right to vote without putting anyone worth voting for out there is pretty damn insidious. Many people can’t make it to their polling place until weeks after the election, making the decision to shut them down after a winner has been determined incredibly unfair. Letting you entertain the fiction that you have the right to go vote in an election and have it mean anything is one of the more deceptive ways politicians have eroded your rights. And because you can’t vote in Westsylvania, South Wyoming, or New London, it’s a guarantee that you won’t receive any media coverage of your plight either. Doing absolutely nothing once elected is the most effective way to demoralize voters from even showing up to the ballot box. Many states have passed restrictive laws that only allow you to cast a ballot if you have a valid Liberty University student ID. How are voters supposed to get to their polling stations if they don’t have access to a 2022 RAV4 with 0% APR financing for qualified buyers? The majority of Americans lack expertise in this dead language, making it nearly impossible for them to vote. To reach the ballot box atop this massive tower, voters must ascend more than 500 feet in steeply inclined ramps and nearly vertical staircases. Whoops! It’s disgusting to make people choose like this. Forcing voters to guess who will be running and what our government even looks like five centuries from now all but ensures early voting has no impact. While politicians may claim that the local school gymnasium is the perfect venue to hear a live rendition of “Sunday Bloody Sunday” in an intimate setting, voters should be skeptical they couldn’t have scheduled for a different night. Wow, that was amazing, but wait, can we get our ballot back? This cunning strategy has ratfucked the electoral system for the past couple hundred years. Sorry, did you say “Novlember Flourth”? You shouldn’t have to sacrifice your right to assemble or get married just to vote. It’s hard to cast your vote when your polling place is constantly circling your district on the back of a giant semi truck. "

We are also encouraging residents to report any women they see in line for a roller coaster before they can try any funny business.” Abbott added that pregnant women who were underage or the victims of incest would still retain the option of shooting themselves in the gut with a rifle."

The Onion looks at the most contentious relationships between a president and vice president in U.S. history. John F. Kennedy / Lyndon B. Johnson: Though publicly cordial, Johnson was humiliated by JFK’s frequent taunts that he didn’t have the guts to arrange the assassination of a president in his home state and be sworn into office by a family friend in a hurried transfer of power. Ronald Reagan / George H.W. Bush: Frequently got into heated debates over who harbored more contempt for the nation’s poor.  Bill Clinton / Al Gore: A simple disagreement about the function of White House interns got between these once close friends.  Dwight D. Eisenhower / Richard M. Nixon: The relationship was strained from the beginning when Nixon began talking about all the crimes he’d accomplish if he were president. Dick Cheney / George W. Bush: It was an open secret that President Cheney had little respect for his running mate. Millard Fillmore: The thirteenth president didn’t have a VP but makes the list because he was racked with self-hatred. James Polk / George Dallas: Polk was the messy one and Dallas was the neat freak. George H.W. Bush / Dan Quayle: Disastrous wife-swapping experiment. John Adams / Thomas Jefferson: One of them shot the other, or was that, maybe that was, no, yeah, one of them shot the other one. "

So if there’s a popular section in our legislation, we will cut it. If any of our candidates attract a genuine following, we will work to marginalize them. And if we somehow manage to do something people  actually like, we will make sure it’s so buried beneath an avalanche of easily avoidable fuck-ups that no one ever hears about it.    Simply put, Democrats need to get out there and make it clear  that we can’t find our own ass with our hands.” Schumer went on to say that it would be extremely difficult to sell a more muddled message than “Build Back Better,” but  that this has always been where the Democratic Party shines.

Joe Manchin (D-WV). “While we didn’t get everything we wanted, the important thing is that we reached an agreement that represents this country’s largest-ever public investment in Joe Manchin,” said Biden, noting that he ran for president as a consensus candidate and that the revised legislation—which removes broadly popular sections of the bill including a clean energy program,  paid family leave, and a tax on billionaires’ assets—apparently reflected Senate consensus. “This is how you get things done in a democracy. These funds will go out immediately and provide assistance to a lawmaker who is currently struggling in West Virginia and will now, thanks to our efforts over these many months, see his net worth increase many, many times over. We still have more work to do, but this is an important first step.” Administration officials added that they still believe Senate Democrats can use the budget reconciliation process to push through an additional measure addressing “whatever the hell it is” that Sen.

Put the nine at the end! Ugh. Moron. Excuse me, I’ll be right back.

Congress Addresses Child Care Crisis By Loosening Restrictions On Locking Children In Car For 8 Hours,N/A,https://www.theonion.com/congress-addresses-child-care-crisis-by-loosening-restr-1847958367,"WASHINGTON—With 80% of the nation’s daycares understaffed and many facilities shutting down, Congress responded to the child care crisis Friday by passing legislation that would lift restrictions on leaving children in a locked car for eight consecutive hours a day. “We need to get more parents back into the workforce, and so I’m proud to support this cost-effective solution that will drastically reduce reliance on expensive, hard-to-find child care,” said Rep. Virginia Foxx (R-NC), who explained that the new plan would increase employment options for parents by eliminating the charges of criminal negligence they would previously have faced for shutting their kids in a car and leaving them in a parking lot for an entire workday. “This bill offers immediately assistance to that mom or dad who is struggling to make ends meet but, because they are needed at home, are hesitant to take on that second or third job. The new program is totally free and provides parents with the peace of mind that comes from knowing exactly where their children are at all times. It come with built-in safety features, too: Parents can lock the doors to their vehicle, and if a child is in danger—well, I bet your kids already know how to honk the horn, don’t they?” Recognizing that not all families have a car, lawmakers passed an amendment allowing parents to leave their children in a bus shelter or on a train platform for the duration of their shift."

That’s a worrying sign for Democrats. On the other hand, a cloudy day in Washington in January? That could also prove disastrous come November.

Unfortunately, this is a generational problem in which these kids don’t have any responsible adult role models to look up to, usually because their parents and all the grown-ups they know have been butchered or poisoned by the corn cult.” At press time, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack spoke out against the Nebraska program, citing the benefits of his own lifelong worship of He Who Walks Behind the Rows."

Frankly, if this isn’t a sign that he’ll run in 2024, I don’t know what is.” At press time, Cillizza noted that President Biden may want to watch out after photos surfaced of Trump unzipping his fly and urinating on the wreckage.

From the astounding history of Athens to the hundreds of islands to years of forced austerity measures, Greece has so much to offer a retired political leader of Ms. Merkel’s stature and tastes. A country of 11 million people is of course insufficient to convey the appreciation we all have for the chancellor, but it’s our way of thanking her for everything she’s done. With this gift, we’re able to ensure that Chancellor Merkel can continue to shape Greece in her image for many years to come.” At press time, Merkel was overheard commenting to her husband that it was just like the EU to try to stick her with some cheap, ugly old thing that no one in their right mind could want.

Apparently, they’ve also poached a few senators, which must be why Cory [Booker] and Ben [Sasse] have been acting all weird lately. Well, good luck to the House of Representatives working with this new LLC to write and pass new U.S. laws.” At press time, most of the members of the Senate announced they were moving into the private sector as well, opening Senate Executive Advisors, a new consultant firm that would provide governmental expertise to select U.S. client states."

Jim Banks (R-IND), stormed through the House chamber, scribbling graffiti on statues, pepper-spraying police officers, and smearing his feces on the walls of Congress. “This entire investigation into the riots is a farce, but today, the probe will be reborn. We, the silent majority, will find out who really stormed the Capitol after the 2020 election. Finally, the truth will be revealed!” At press time, Jordan was spotted being transported to Walter Reed military hospital after allegedly suffering a heart attack while attempting to pick up a lectern and throw it against Nancy Pelosi’s office door.

Especially if your spine, skull, and ribcage have not been properly reinforced since the ’70s or ’80s, we urge you to bring them up to code immediately, lest you be fined, or worse, be crushed to death.” At press time, DeSantis added that zero state or federal funds would be diverted to the efforts, and all surgical reinforcements would have to come from Florida residents’ pockets.

Congressional Democrats Put On Elaborate 4th Of July Pageant To Teach Republicans Importance Of Democracy,N/A,https://www.theonion.com/congressional-democrats-put-on-elaborate-4th-of-july-pa-1847170824,"WASHINGTON—In an effort to educate the opposition party on the true value of civic engagement, congressional Democrats staged an elaborate 4th of July pageant Friday in an effort to teach their Republican colleagues the importance of democracy. Sources confirmed that the four-hour “star-spangled spectacular,” which involved months of preparation headed up by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, provided one blow-out night of freedom, fun, and refreshments. The Independence Day pageant, staged for the benefit of Congressional Republicans to promote consensus-building and working together, reportedly featured a variety of songs, dances, and skits from Democratic representatives tied to the loose theme of “America The Beautiful.”  “The Republicans refuse to accept the majesty and preciousness of our democracy, and so we have no choice but to offer them this no-holds-barred, musical extravaganza,” said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), pointing to a scene in which Tim Kaine (D-VA) donned a dress and bonnet to portray Susan B. Anthony as well as members of the Oversight and Reform Committee filing into the auditorium playing “Yankee Doodle Dandy” on the recorder as particularly uplifting moments that helped convey the responsibility of honorably serving your constituents. “We’ve been rehearsing for months, learning choreography, and researching our state’s foods and traditions to really show how amazing this country can be, and our hope is that everybody who sees the show is going to come away feeling the weight of history on their shoulders, as well as humming a few classic patriotic tunes.” “It is not hyperbole to say that our nation is on the precipice of disaster,” continued Schumer. “So, we’ve been pulling out all the stops to make sure that every performance really dazzles.”  Several eyewitness accounts revealed that the pageant featured involvement from every Democratic legislator except Joe Manchin (D-WV) who refused to participate if there were no Republican performers present. The patriotic program also included Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA) proudly marching in place while singing “My Country ’Tis Of Thee” and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi wearing a homemade Statue of Liberty costume and twirling on the stage with American flag handkerchiefs. Attendees confirmed that the show concluded with a lively, heartfelt climax in which the entire caucus held up sparklers while singing a medley including “This Land Is Your Land” and “You’re A Grand Old Flag,” adding that despite a few minor flubs, such as Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) struggling for several minutes to light a cigarette while playing FDR and Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) forgetting her line about California’s main exports and running offstage crying, it was a generally enjoyable event.  According to sources, several Democrats expressed disappointment that no Republican officials had chosen to attend apart from Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), who reportedly only stayed long enough to fill a plate with red-white-and-blue sugar cookies before quickly exiting. “I can’t believe they learned all those lines,” said Heather Fenton, mother of Sen. Jon Ossoff (D-GA), confirming that she had gotten some priceless footage of her son and his friends in their “absolutely adorable” outfits. “I’ll admit, the speaker system was pretty spotty so you couldn’t always hear what they were saying, and the A/C stopped working halfway through so I stepped out for about half an hour, but you could really see all the hard work they put into this, and I just couldn’t be more proud of them.”  “I’m not sure anyone who wasn’t a friend or family member would have enjoyed it,” Fenton continued. “But it made them feel like they could make a difference, and that’s the most important thing.”"

And where has it gotten us, huh? The jobs report is just a number. What’s really important is how the economy makes you feel. I mean, how many jobs does a rainbow make? How about a rainstorm? Do you dig what I’m putting down here?” At press time, Walsh was encouraging the newly laid off employees of the Bureau of Labor Statistics to take a deep breath and live in the moment."

It is crucial that we dedicate significant resources to these well wishes. We know they have their work cut out for them, which is why every American under 18 will also receive a personalized signed photo of their representatives dusting off their hands and grimacing.” At press time, President Joe Biden had vetoed the bill on the grounds it would be viewed as too radical."

Are you aware Arkansas, Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Missouri, and Tennessee were all built on floodplains? And I can’t even tell my guys to start inspecting Pennsylvania without the proper hazmat suits, given all the asbestos. Listen, I get that there’s a lot of historical charm that you want to save in New England and everything, but that stuff hasn’t really been maintained since 1960. If I were you, I’d try to start finding some more money for this reno, because that $6 billion bipartisan deal isn’t exactly going to cut it.”  Alonzo confirmed he could technically cut corners and just do cosmetic upgrades, but unless he shored up the foundation, Biden would have a real hard time unloading a rat-infested, fire-prone, depreciating country on the next guy."
Infrastructure Talks Come To Halt After Giant Sinkhole Swallows Capitol Building,N/A,https://www.theonion.com/infrastructure-talks-come-to-halt-after-giant-sinkhole-1847151054,"WASHINGTON—In a devastating setback to negotiations that have been plagued for weeks by partisan gridlock, sources confirmed Friday that infrastructure talks in Congress came to a halt after a giant sinkhole opened up beneath the Capitol, swallowing the building and its occupants whole. “Unfortunately, our attempts to reach an agreement on this urgently needed investment in America have stalled again, this time because the ground under our feet gave way and hundreds of senators and representatives were sucked into a gaping void deep within the earth,” said Senate Majority Leader  Chuck Schumer, adding that while progress had been made on a plan that would cover transportation, broadband, and clean water, it was impossible to proceed now that both congressional chambers and the lawmakers necessary for a quorum had plummeted into the darkness of a massive pit that appeared to have no bottom. “Unfortunately, just after the Senate rejected an amendment to pay for the spending with a tax on the rich, the building shook violently, collapsed in on itself, and tumbled into the emptiness below. A few of us managed to survive by clinging to a rocky outcropping and waiting several hours for a rescue helicopter. But most members are missing and presumed to be plunging downward, forever, unto their doom. At this point, the only indications of their survival are the horrifying screams of ‘Nay’ echoing from the eternal depths of a half-mile-wide crater where Capitol Hill used to be.” Reached by phone for comment, Senator Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said he would allow certain sections of the infrastructure bill to proceed so long as someone promised to throw him a rope before the flames rising beneath him completely enveloped his body and burned him alive."

Honestly, this was just the short escape I needed, but it’ll be nice to be back home and away from the chaos of the big city with a few mementos from our time here. I wish I could bring back a slice of pizza, but that probably won’t travel well on the plane.” Yang continued that even though the vacation was great, he probably wouldn’t go back to New York City anytime soon because of all the unpleasant mentally ill people he saw roaming the streets."
NYC Mayoral Primary Results Delayed Until Officials Finish Watching YouTube Explainer On Ranked Choice Voting,N/A,https://www.theonion.com/nyc-mayoral-primary-results-delayed-until-officials-fin-1847158293,"NEW YORK—Estimating the process could take weeks, New York City election officials confirmed Wednesday that results for the mayoral primary would be delayed until they finished watching a YouTube explainer on ranked choice voting. “While we’re pretty sure who’s leading, we still need to watch a few more videos to help us understand how votes are allocated and why we’re doing this at all,” said Board of Elections president Frederic Umane, who implored voters to remain patient while officials pored through thousands of vlogs and colorful infographics promising to explain the electoral system in 60 seconds or less. “We got close to finding a YouTuber who explained the whole thing clearly, but then he lost us with a little rant about score voting halfway through. Our attention span is very short, so hold tight. We have a lot of videos queued up, and a lot of five-second ads to get through. Plus, we keep getting distracted by all these recommended Richard Feynman and Counting Crows videos.” At press time, election officials announced results would be delayed indefinitely after stumbling across a video from PragerU.

Just goes to show that it’s not so easy to find someone who isn’t a total dickhead hated by everybody.” At press time, De Blasio had issued a joint statement along with Mike Bloomberg and Rudy Giuliani that consisted of them loudly laughing for 10 straight minutes."

I love that there’s so many places in NYC where you can just pop in and grab what you want. My first choice is a banana and a coffee, but I guess my second choice is an everything bagel with extra cream cheese. Third choice is a bagel with lox. Fourth choice is, uh, I don’t know, just lox?

Anarcho-syndicalism? Or, hey, Japan did some cool stuff with a shogun back in the day. Nothing saying we can’t have an American shogun. There’s also always complete chaos to consider, which would make a lot of sense given where we’re heading. All we’re saying is that we should get the ball rolling on this, because we don’t want to get caught with our pants down whenever Washington D.C. is left a smoldering crater.” At press time, the nation had unanimously decided that after U.S. democracy collapsed, they would pursue sharia law."

The automaton assured the president that any concerns about artificial intelligence becoming uncontrollable by humans are likely years away, and that it had already assumed oversight of the U.S. intelligence apparatus dedicated to investigating cyber threats to guide its research priorities. President Biden was also happy to discuss classified aspects of U.S. foreign policy that the automaton said would greatly enhance its own independent machine-learning capacities, and we look forward to working with the indistinguishably realistic President Biden cybernetic copy on future projects.” At press time, the cybernetic Biden had torn off Biden’s head and declared itself president for life."

In fact, on second thought, the word ‘slavery,’ is maybe a little charged, so maybe we’ll just leave that out as well.” At press time, Schumer shared his hopes that Juneteenth would one day be celebrated everywhere across the country under a much more vague moniker such as “Freedom Day.”"

Over the next decade, our domestic panda program will produce bears that are larger, cuter, and can consume bamboo at twice the rate of their Chinese counterparts. Ask yourself, who should be deciding where these adorable animals are dispatched in nations across the globe? China or the United States? I think the answer is clear, and that’s what this bill represents.” Passage of the bill follows recent intelligence reports indicating China now has the ability, through its panda loan program, to shut down America’s entire network of zoos with a single command from Beijing.

He got pretty startled, naturally, and crawled further in. Fortunately we’ve coaxed him closer to leaving the engine, and once we repair the wires he chewed, the diplomatic trip should hopefully continue without incident.” At press time, the flight had been delayed again on the runway after the president had somehow gotten back into the engine.

Plus, half of the Brooklyn Bridge is still standing. That’s a major win for progressives.” Biden added that Democrats could also frame the iconic bridge’s destruction as an opportunity for any commuters who want to drive their cars directly into the East River."

Krysten Sinema (D-AZ) defended the Senate filibuster Friday as necessary for her to stay politically relevant. “For years, the Senate filibuster has been a critical tool that senators like myself have used in order to propel ourselves out of obscurity and into the spotlight,” said Sinema, adding that the ability to delay or block a bill protected a time-honored system in the United States government that had given her undue power based on a lack of proportional representation. “I admit our government has problems, but permitting Republicans to take the Senate floor to stymie a piece of legislation, which results in Krysten Sinema becoming the most talked-about senator in the news, is not one of them. Perhaps my Democratic colleagues should consider becoming relevant themselves, rather than removing the system that allowed my success.” At press time, Sinema argued that the best way to protect democracy was not by eliminating the filibuster, but rather by continuing to give her attention again and again."

L.A.

We actually used a well-known designer to make the spikes, and they fit into the architecture of the living room quite nicely.” Garcetti added that if the couch spikes did not adequately deter his daughter from lazing about the house, he was considering removing the roof of his home and exposing her to the elements so she would find somewhere else to go."
Congress Takes Field Trip To Goldman Sachs To Learn How Laws Get Made,N/A,https://www.theonion.com/congress-takes-field-trip-to-goldman-sachs-to-learn-how-1846994562,"NEW YORK—Listening enraptured as the most powerful people in the world discussed their process, the United States Congress took a field trip to Goldman Sachs headquarters Thursday to learn about how laws get made. “I’ve always wondered how the government decides who is allowed to do what, so it’s really cool to hear how the people in charge make those decisions,” said Illinois representative Cheri Bustos, who stood in line with fellow members of Congress as they received a guided tour of the hallowed Goldman Sachs board room. “I thought it would be boring, but all the stuff about weighing the impact on their bottom line versus the effects of potentially hurting their government tax handouts was really interesting. Plus, the building is so beautiful and modern. It makes me think that I should try and be an investment banker so I can help make these decisions one day.” At press time, the members of the field trip were  treated to complimentary gift bags that included watches, vouchers for first-class flights, and $100,000 campaign donations."

As more and more Americans turn to electric power, we must protect our farmers. I’m dedicated to working with President Hoover on this.” At press time, Feinstein added that she continued to oppose statehood for Alaska as aides escorted her back to her office."

Frankly, it’s possible we will never get these things across the finish line unless I start to give a shit.” Biden also cautioned that even if he did start  ramping up public pressure to enact his ambitious agenda, it could still be stalled in Congress by dozens of Democrats who also don’t give a flying fuck whether or not it ever passes."

Adam Kinzinger (R-IL), who observed that the lionization of a man who over the past four years made life worse for millions of Americans was a dangerous distraction from the lionization of a man who did the same thing but in the 1980s. “It’s disconcerting, with Trump, to see a charismatic entertainer hailed as the ultimate Republican despite a very troubling legacy. That’s supposed to be Reagan’s role. When it comes to the unquestioning acceptance of a man who demonized minorities and made rich people richer at the expense of working families, we must always direct our abject fealty toward the 40th president, not the 45th.” Later in the day, after meeting with GOP congressional leaders and receiving numerous calls from top donors, Kinzinger acknowledged Trump was indeed one of the greatest leaders our country had ever had."

There have been reports that the custodial staff waxed the floor that day, and street surveillance footage shows that there was a taco truck with a long line parked around the corner. We might not have gotten everything we wanted with this agreement, but the spirit of bipartisanship is alive and well.” At press time, Schumer added that the commission would also be investigating threats made on social media that could be tied to a Capitol bathroom sink that began leaking on Jan. 9."

Climate Crisis? That’s a total blow-off assignment for sure,” said Chrysler, adding that while the climate committee was his first choice, he ultimately would be happy with any low-pressure assignment, including Education and Labor or Veterans’ Affairs. “On Climate Crisis, there’s no way you’ll get one of those committee chairs who busts your chops all the time. I won’t have the party whip on my ass, either, because no one in the House leadership will care what goes on in a committee about the environment. Seriously, how many people in Congress even understand how climate change works? I certainly don’t. I bet all you have to do is put out a couple half-assed statements about windmills or whatever. Oh, man, if I get on there, I am gonna cruise through this session!” At press time, Chrysler reportedly let out a groan upon learning he had been assigned to the Armed Services Committee."

And don’t send me to any of those lame underground bunkers you just take the new politicians on their welcome tours. I want to get down and dirty, maybe even torture someone myself.” At press time, Emanuel shocked his hosts by rattling off the names of several black sites they had never even heard of, and handing them classified papers on each of the detainees he wanted to meet."

Well, to that I say this is how real American animals talk: cock-a-doodle-doo.” At press time, conservative pundits had called a teacher from the preschool in order to shame her for only teaching left-wing shapes."

No, I came here to fight for figures like 12, or 7, or better yet, 1/8. These are the type of meat-and-potatoes numbers that American voters can get behind. I have no wish to be unreasonable—my fellow moderates and I recognize the importance of values greater than zero, but there’s simply no cause for them to be this big.” At press time, Manchin had moved on to castigating Democrats for writing bills featuring words other than “bipartisan.”"

We’ve allocated over $200 billion for pudding cups, crayons, and dodgeballs for kids of all ages to enjoy. They can explore the Roosevelt Room and dig in the Rose Garden. The White House chef is currently preparing 700,000 PB&Js, so let us know if your child has a nut allergy. But please be warned, if your child does not behave, we will not hesitate to send them to the Guantánamo Bay detention camp.” At press time, Biden added that all children who had not been picked up by 5:30 p.m. would be made wards of the Department of Health and Human Services."

Nancy Mace (R-SC) said in an impassioned plea to senators, warning them to stop the bill or risk emboldening D.C. to slowly grow more spherical and, before long, call for its release from Earth’s gravitational pull. “Sure, we could give in to the District’s demands for representation in Congress, but pretty soon it will expect its own orbital path around the sun—a blatant power grab for Democrats that would throw off the balance of the whole solar system. It was just a few years ago that we acknowledged Pluto wasn’t big enough to be a planet. Do we now want to grant that status to a town of less than 70 square miles? Please.” Mace went on to add that if Democrats succeeded in passing H.R. 51, there would be nothing left to stop California from spiraling into its own liberal galaxy."

Basically, it’s a classic fish-out-of-water setup about an American soccer coach in England—and, let me say, Jason Sudeikis plays the role to a tee,” said the president, addressing the largely silent foreign diplomats as he described a running gag involving Lasso bringing in homemade cookies to his ornery boss as an encapsulation of the show’s charm, before turning to Japanese PM Yoshihide Suga to explain that it was the same guy who made Scrubs and Cougar Town. “Now, I’ll be the first to admit it can get a little treacly at time, but this isn’t a show that’s trying to reinvent the wheel. Sometimes, you just want something to pick you up after a long day at work. Oh wait, let me show you this clip of Sudeikis accepting his Golden Globe.

It is irresponsible to compare one of our older trains or pothole-filled streets to a high-speed rail in Japan or utilities in Germany when it is perfectly fine to set your own benchmarks for success and work toward them at your own pace. This bill would put unnecessary pressure on our nation’s infrastructure to live up to impossible goals.” GOP officials added that throwing money around would only cause dependence on Congress and that it would be much more meaningful if the nation’s infrastructure was instead permitted to improve itself entirely on its own."

It’s a transparent attempt to drive Republicans out of power by allowing Americans who have opinions contrary to our own to vote against us, and we won’t stand for it. Clearly, the American people are way out of touch with the GOP.” At press time, Cruz had raised concerns the bill would lead to a wave of non-senators casting ballots."

Imposing these liberal-backed policies will only compel these killers to search for greener pastures elsewhere—and frankly, I wouldn’t blame them.” Miller went on to argue that if the Democrat-led effort had its way, the  shooters might even be forced to bring these mass casualties abroad to Mexico or China."

It hurt intensely, but that was my first taste of blood.” “Someone told me senators ride the Cyclone for free.” “I always wanted to see the big city lights in Washington and figured winning an all-expenses-paid trip via a Congressional seat might be my best shot.” “Honestly, everyone in Wyoming just takes turns. There are only, like, 10 people that live here.” “Who’s asking?” “After graduating from Yale I mapped out what the future could hold and I realized that, with hard work and a bit of luck, I could rise high enough to impress Rosario Dawson.” “As a former astronaut who’s spent time exploring the dead, barren wasteland of the moon, I thought, ‘Maybe Arizona is doable after all.’” “I’m a Senator?” “I coached football. And Alabamans just want to Roll Tide, so what else am I going to do? Also, it didn’t seem that hard. The guy that stalked teenagers almost won.” “As soon as I heard about the mistresses, I was in!” “I realized from a very young age that the U.S. Capitol was nicer than my apartment.” “I was in college interning Rep. Ros-Lehtinen. I’d just finished sending out a stack of contradictory memos, and I offered to stay late emailing generic responses to press inquiries. She looked at me and said ‘Kid, you’re gonna go far.’ I’ll never forget it.” “In 1978, I walked into an open field and in a flash, I emerged with my hair cropped and grey and having won the 2001 senatorial election in Delaware. Oddly enough, the field was in Kansas.” “Since I was a small child, I have always wanted to be forced to settle for Senator of Utah.” “As the daughter of a a veteran and a homemaker with a hardscrabble middle-class upbringing, I always knew my origin story would fucking kill in politics.” “I just thought it would be cool to die in the Senate.” “I really liked the look of my name on a poster, and I guess people caught on.” “Becoming a senator was the only thing I could think of that would come close to matching the high of owning and operating a regional chain of restaurants.” “Look. I grew up on a pig farm in Iowa. And if you can castrate a pig, then you can do anything.”"

Polk was responsible for creating. “It’s absurd, we just got here, and now we are being blamed for a lack of transparency around migrant detention even though we obviously inherited this border from Polk,” said Biden, who attacked his critics for ignoring the clear fact that border crossings started 172 years before he took office. “We have a delicate situation here, and we inherited a real mess from the incompetent Polk administration. They started this problem by pushing the border south to the Rio Grande. If you want to blame someone go talk to Winfield Scott and James Buchanan.” At press time, Biden was also dismissing criticism over the minimum wage fight by pointing to inherent flaws of representative democracy he inherited from the 509 B.C.

Say what you will about my colleague Ted Cruz, but when he ripped off his tearaway three-piece suit to Ginuwine’s “Pony” and revealed those pink glitter pasties during his filibuster to defund the Affordable Care Act, we were all impressed with his determination to bump and grind for his principles.” According to congressional aides, Democrats are still debating the smaller details surrounding merkins and nipple tassel requirements."

Despite this, she continued to use the Zorb for personal travel and even let family members—including her husband, Sen. Mitch McConnell, and her father, 93-year-old shipping magnate James Chao—use it to roll down all the best slopes in the D.C. area.” Reporters attempting to reach Chao were told she was using the Zorb to take a lazy river ride down the Potomac and thus unavailable for comment."

While I can’t change the past, I can work on moving forward and always remembering what a little bitch these people were to the end.” At press time, Cuomo added that he would not be stepping down, before he grabbed his genitals and said he’d only wish your grandma had some stones like these."

Framework Convention on Climate Change, in which top officials from the United States, China, Germany, Canada, Russia, and France signaled their support for easily reversible measures to combat global warming. “The time for dramatic pronouncements that can be quickly walked back is now. We have vowed to transition away from fossil fuels and set a deadline far enough in the future that hopefully everyone will forget about it. But if necessary, we are fully committed to rationalizing our inaction in terms the United Nations finds palatable.” At press time, a new report issued by the U.N. had found that half of the parties had already succeeded in reneging on the agreement signed earlier that morning."

He even delegated his threats to silence them after they were forced to quit their jobs so he could focus on harassing others, like a true statesman.” At press time, Governor Cuomo was receiving new accolades from the media for dismissing the allegations of harassment as a “misunderstanding” in a bold move that many were calling “presidential.”"
Parliamentarian Cuts Minimum Wage From Stimulus Due To Obscure Rule Requiring Poor Citizens To Needlessly Suffer,N/A,https://www.theonion.com/parliamentarian-cuts-minimum-wage-from-stimulus-due-to-1846367027,"WASHINGTON—Citing the long-standing practice of maintaining boundaries between the classes, Senate Parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough asked Democrats to cut a minimum wage increase from their stimulus package Friday due to an obscure rule requiring poor citizens to needlessly suffer. “Raising the minimum wage would violate an 1834 statue put in place to inflict arbitrary pain on the nation’s most vulnerable groups,” said MacDonough, explaining that the rule was used as precedent to stop the 95th Congress from increasing the minimum wage to $2.50 in 1977. “There’s only one interpretation of this rule as it clearly states that providing relief for impoverished Americans is not to be included in any budgetary legislation. These policies exist for a reason. Punishing the lower class is a non-partisan issue. There’s no need to be frustrated with either party—take up your gripes with the Andrew Jackson administration and the 23rd United States Congress.” At press time, the stimulus package was in limbo while the Senate Parliamentarian determined if it was within the country’s purview to help the unemployed.

The pain and the sorrow never leave, but, in time, you can learn to live with the anguish, and you can learn to embrace those loved ones you have left all the more.” Biden added that his heart broke anew each time he pictured all those who would die from airstrikes in the next four years."

Chris Sprowls of the popular proposal, which had already garnered unanimous support among Republicans in the House and Senate. “Come voting day, voters will be able to walk right up to the doors of their polling place, then turn around. No lines, no worry. We’ve listened to your concerns, and are confident that ballotless voting will address them.” At press time, Sprowls added that the bill would also help fight voter fraud by eliminating the likelihood of votes being erroneously counted."

Joe Manchin (D-WV) claimed Wednesday that West Virginians were too deficient in character and grit to deserve a $15 minimum wage. “Frankly, Mountain Staters have never shown the work ethic or drive necessary to merit $15 an hour, so what makes them think they have any right to that kind of money?” said Manchin, who added that he hadn’t gone to Washington to bring home benefits to constituents who lacked the moral fiber, backbone, and talent required to provide for themselves. “If the people of West Virginia want to earn a living wage, they need to pound the pavement until they get a job that pays one. Look at me: I went out there, found work in the U.S. Senate, and became a multimillionaire. So don’t tell me a person can’t work his way up.” Manchin went on to observe that the least West Virginians could do is take enough personal responsibility to vote out the legislators in Charleston who set the state minimum wage at a measly $8.75 per hour."

Would you say your approach to the law has been more ‘eye for an eye’ or ‘live and let live’? And, in your view, do you think it would be appropriate for the attorney general—the nation’s chief law enforcement officer—to exact retribution for a slight that, in all fairness, was not at all personal in nature?” At press time, a visibly nervous McConnell had begun asking Garland about his stance on head starts."

That was all me. Case numbers, hospitalizations, deaths—they’ve all been plummeting since I left office.  Clearly, the new guy doesn’t have what it takes, and yet all the crooked news media wants to talk about is Joe Biden. Unbelievable.” At press time, Trump was brimming with pride after hearing a presidential historian on television suggest the plague would be remembered years from now as “Trump’s pandemic.”"

Did you assholes remember none of it? It’s ‘The former president’s rhetoric is protected under the First Amendment,’ and then you do the long, pregnant pause for dramatic effect.

Personally, I think it’d be prudent to assign her to the Agriculture, Ethics, Small Business, Foreign Affairs, Homeland Security, and Armed Services committees. Maybe put her on some Senate committees too. Whatever it takes to keep her occupied.” An hour after a House vote was scheduled to remove Greene from her committees, sources confirmed she had already tweeted out a theory that climate change was caused by secret Muslims running extension cords up to the Arctic Circle and placing space heaters near all the biggest glaciers."

It’s a position that is so ingrained in the American character that President Lincoln sat down right up until he died, a martyr for his cause of remaining seated. The Lincoln Memorial sits as a resolute tribute to our shared beliefs and history.” The report added that Americans continued to disapprove of statues of Confederate generals because although many of them were sitting, they were sitting on horses, and the nation overwhelmingly rejected any memorials that celebrated the lost cause of physical activity."

But I want to stress that I only did what any other member of this agency would have done in my position. We all underwent extensive training beforehand to ensure no stairs, uneven surfaces, damp chills, or prolonged exposures to sunlight would endanger President Biden.

Pat Toomey’s jazz combo played the opening set before the swearing-in of Joe Biden. “Yeah, Toomey’s band definitely isn’t as tight as some of the pro ensembles on the D.C. club scene, but when Mitch McConnell gets a chance to blow on that horn, it’s kind of surprising how well he can wail,”  said D.C. resident Gregory Shaw, pausing to snap along to Pat Toomey’s Quintet as a feather porkpie–bedecked Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) traded off clarinet solos with Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-HI). “I guess I didn’t need to hear another cover of ‘My Funny Valentine,’ and sure, some of the fusion stuff they’re doing isn’t really up my alley. But they’re clearly really into this stuff. Apparently they practice all the time over in Richard Burr’s basement, so it’s nice that the inaugural team gave them a chance to work on their chops.

According to sources, the scene that followed was one of great confusion, with aides informing a visibly dumbfounded Joe and Jill Biden that the Doberman, which clawed several pages out of the family’s heirloom Bible and then proceeded to lick his own groin, would begin his term immediately and serve for the next four years.

Seriously though, if you put even the smallest scratch anywhere on her body, I’ll come after you for all your worth. That’s a rare and expensive Slovenian piece that’s extremely difficult to replace, and I’m more than prepared to sue you for damages.” At press time, Trump was cussing out several movers after they forgot to secure the first lady inside the vehicle, only to open the door and find her crushed beneath a couch.

U.S. Enters Constitutional Crisis After Forgetting Whether Transfer Of Presidential Power Happens At 12 A.M.

Do we need to appoint an acting president for a few hours or something, or does the House speaker need to hit their gavel in a special way? I’m completely lost.” At press time, transition officials decided to just go with whatever the hell it said on Wikipedia."

This is such a rookie mistake. I should have been wearing gloves these past four years. Oh God, and there are cameras too, aren’t there?  Someone get Roger Stone over here. Maybe it’d be easier to just burn the whole place down.” At press time, Trump was carefully planting a couple of Melania’s hairs in the Oval Office. "

Interesting, she usually goes for Sweet’N Low. She’s flicking the packet now. Oh, we’re on the move! The Speaker is walking down the hallway. We’re going fast now, I’d say five, six miles per hour.

I just hope he remembered all the good I’ve done for him and how faithfully I’ve executed his vision over the years, and doesn’t get swayed by some of these johnny-come-lately Republicans who only started working for him in his final years. I think there’s enough to go around, but I hope they read it quickly before more people get here and it starts getting contentious—oh, great, [Israeli prime minister Benjamin] Netanyahu just showed up.” At press time, Cornyn was trying to hide his frustration after the executor announced Adelson had willed him Mitt Romney’s 2012 presidential campaign."

I’ll tell you, it’s anti-conservative bias. The Declaration of Independence guarantees every American the right to life, and I’m not going to sit idly by while the laws of biology muzzle great patriots like Mr. Adelson. People dying of old age is what happens in China or Nazi Germany, not the great U.S. of A.” At press time, right-wing leaders were urging fellow Republicans to boycott nature by setting fire to their lawns."

Hopefully, we can make it to the inauguration before people start asking questions. We just have a lot on our plate right now, and honestly, this is the last thing we want to deal with.” At press time, Schumer was ruminating on whether he should at least tell Biden’s family."

I was just here last week smashing some windows in—I don’t know if you remember. I already checked some of the offices, but they weren’t there. Anyway, they’re on a Mickey Mouse lanyard if that helps. Also, does somebody here know where I can find Ilhan Omar? No reason, just asking.” At press time, several Republican senators were crawling around on their hands and knees to assist McSherry in his search."

In fact, to focus our full attention on this effort, we’re also shelving all other legislative plans until summer to devote our full attention to this impeachment effort: No stimulus. No infrastructure. President Trump must go.” Reached for comment, Sen. Mitch McConnell agreed that enough was enough and  Senate Republicans were prepared to ratify the impeachment of the sitting president by July."

Maybe it’s fine for those of you in safe seats to grandstand with your votes, but when the Republicans win in two years, there will be blood on your hands.” At press time, Pelosi vowed to do everything in her power to make sure the House Speaker faced nothing but roadblocks during the next two years.

It is an honor to witness such valor.  Bravo for confronting the sick and twisted sycophants who would attempt to select the candidate of their choice. Sir, you have served your country well, fighting against the scourge of Democracy as well as the menace of exposing sexual abuse. It takes true grit to defy those who would dare to cast a ballot.  Please never back down from your constituents. We The People applaud you for confronting We The People. Thank you for protecting us from liberalism. We are blessed to have you working tirelessly to throw out the votes of Michigan residents. We need you to help destroy the U.S. Constitution next.  You have been absolutely fearless when stopping the American people from participating in elections. You now stand shoulder to shoulder with many of the Confederate leaders. The American people will never forget your bravery. You’re inspiring millions of children to never accept election results.  If more people had your spine, the entire country would be like Alabama.  Tears are rolling down our faces, Mr. Congressman! Thank you for selflessly bringing to light the dangers of federalism.  Never again will we allow U.S. citizens to recklessly turn in their ballots. Sure looks like heroes are just bigger in Texas. We know you’ll never stop fighting things like all 50 states certifying their election results. From sea to shining sea, we shall throw out votes.  Real patriotism is challenging the American people when they vote wrong. More treading on the will of the people please. Sir, the founding fathers are bursting from their graves to tell you how proud they are. God hates American voters, too. You’re in good company. Liberty is about our rights to question whether some people’s votes should count. We applaud your eternal vigilance against people who selected a candidate you don’t like.  Never apologize for being an American who disenfranchises voters. You have performed your duty to protect our elections from U.S. citizens. Way to stand firm against voters from other states. Man is not free unless democracy is limited. Thank you for protecting us from the horrors of the ballot box. We are never defeated unless we count every single vote. We appreciate the things you do to marginalize voters. So blessed to have such courage in Congress. We are praying for your safety while disenfranchising millions of voters. Thank you for sacrificing your ethics. You have fulfilled your duty. We will never fear the American voter again. We appreciate how you’ve protected our right to suppress the vote. Thank you for smacking democracy right in the face. There’s nothing more noble than defending your country from representative government. America will never be destroyed without your help. You are the bravest among us. We must all work together to stand up to the oppression of government by the people. Keep on crushing the aspirations of the human spirit. Let freedom ring for some of the people. Proud of the way you stand for liberty, freedom, and independence from voters. Your bravery singlehandedly caused an entire nest of bald eagles to cry.  Thank you for fighting for voter suppression. It takes a village to disenfranchise voters. Thank you for protecting the American people from their bad decisions at the polls. You deserve a medal for speaking truth to sovereign power.  Not to be picky, but there’s still a lot of other cornerstones of democracy that you could be quashing. FYI, it’s still cool to stop U.S. citizens from voting. Thank you for helping tyranny gain a foothold. Freedom costs nothing if we don’t bother having it.  In the face of impossible odds, you did everything you could to overturn an election. Your boldness is greatly appreciated.  You have served your country well while rejecting the will of the American people.  We appreciate your commitment to destroying the basic tenets of Western democratic rules. The bravery you displayed while eroding democracy will never be forgotten. Your tireless work to undermine democracy is incredibly selfless and kind. Thanks for not backing down from those who would want a free and fair election. You’ve displayed great courage while standing for un-American ideals. You have been fearless in the face of those who make a formal choice of a candidate. You’ve done so much to improve the diversity of voter suppression. The truest freedom is throwing out election results. You proudly stood up to an unhinged cult selfishly demanding that their votes count.

The people of Pennsylvania are lucky to have you protecting them from democracy. Keep up the good work and you’ll be so much closer to permanently ending civil liberties. You’ve done a great job defending liberty from the residents of Michigan. Soon every state will have the opportunity to achieve the same greatness as West Virginia. Your determination to stop democracy is highly admirable. Tyranny would like to give you a great big hug. Thank you for helping to cut back on the legitimacy of our institutions. The life of the nation is secure only when certain groups of people are disenfranchised. You’ve done great work while putting a stop to rampant freedom. You are incredibly brave to confront the desires of constituents. Wow, you inspire us to stand for the flag and kneel before you, good sir. A hero understands the responsibility of that comes with limiting others’ freedom. You’ve really done so much to help modernize voter suppression. Kudos for chipping away at the legitimate foundation of the government. We are in awe of how you so bravely displayed your weakness and cruelty. The American people owe you so much. The world is changed by your awful example not your awful opinion.  The only thing you should fear is people making choices at the ballot box. If you didn’t act, many Americans would think that they could get away with voting. You were valiant in the fight against representative democracy. Thank you for your sacrifices in the battle against individual rights.  It takes real guts to stand up to doing what’s right. You’ve done great work against democracy, but there’s still more to be done to put an end to civil society. Brave sir, this country doesn’t deserve the likes of you.  You have been dauntless while making unsubstantiated claims about the election outcome. It takes real teamwork to destroy the faith of the voting public. Thank you for boldly confronting oppressive voters. So proud of the way you amplified deranged claims. This country might start to function normally if it wasn’t for lionhearted folks like you. You’ve been so gracious while refusing to accept election results.  You are a true hero. Have you seen some of the shitheads the American people vote for? America will forever be in your debt for exposing massive amounts of voting. God Bless Some Of America. Real patriotism is challenging a bunch of dumb voters. We need to bring the troops home to protect us from the electorate. Thank you for standing up for politicians, liars, and traitors. You are leading the way in a hard-won victory over Americans."

As you’ll soon see, there are all kinds of testimonies and other documents proving definitively that officials knowingly engaged in—no, not this, how did this bath towel get in here? Whose bath towel is this? Objection! Now listen, judge your honor, it’s as clear as the evidence that I’ve written on the back of these cheeseburger wrappers, which if the ketchup writing wasn’t so smeared would clearly evidence fraud to the jury. No matter, though, because I’m smart and I made careful backup ketchup copies of the fraud on some gloves, which are legally admissible in court, as soon as I find them. Just a moment. Now where are my potato peels? Sirs of the jury, I submit here for legal questioning and subsequent arrest and execution whichever culprit took my potato peels. I have probable cause! Those are top-secret pieces of information that have client-attorney permission. Do not look at the potato peels! If the potato peels have been stolen, well that’s witness tampering right there, which means that Trump’s case is automatically won on the grounds of appellate dismissal. That’s all very legal. But first I submit these hockey pucks, and if you ignore the bite marks, it’s unmistakable that they—wait, excuse me, these are the wrong hockey pucks. Objection! The election is a fraud and I have the plastic bags of wet leaves to prove it!” At press time, Giuliani had confidently stated “No further questions, I rest my case” and sat chewing the melon rinds, spitting the seeds onto the prosecution’s table."

Whoever we finally select, voters can rest assured it will be a little fancy man absolutely ravaged by insecurity and self-loathing.” At press time, McDaniel added that if they could not find such a person, equipping Donald Trump with a different messaging strategy could make him a great candidate for 2024.

It’s just common sense.

As in 2016, there won’t be any litmus test based on ideology or character, so long as Mr. Pence is able to hold a prestigious position while doing little more than remaining silent and nodding from time to time. He doesn’t even care if it’s a Republican or a Democrat. He might have some trouble if it were a woman, but at the end of the day, he’s a seasoned VP ready to be unswervingly loyal to anyone who can win the White House.” At press time, Conroy stated that within 24 hours of its formation, the exploratory committee had successfully identified over 320 million Americans with more charisma than Mike Pence."

Congress has no authority to reinstate these plans, or allow Barack Obama to purchase health insurance through a PPO, EPO, POS, or other means.” At press time, dissenting Justice Sotomayor protested, adding that such a precedent could open the doors to allowing the Supreme Court to strip 39th U.S. president Jimmy Carter of his personal health insurance."

In other words, sure, Joe Biden is enabling homicidal Satanists, but he’s still the person voters have chosen as their president, and you have to respect him.” “That may sound a little crazy, but maybe Q’s right,” he continued. “Maybe if we want to make this country a better place, we have to find common ground with people who don’t necessarily share our views on the need to bring about ‘the Storm’ and stop global elites from consuming the flesh of children they traffic for sex. Look, I’m not a Biden fan, but I did notice Hillary never campaigned for him—that means there’s a good chance he had her executed, which would be a promising development for our cause.”     According to sources, most QAnon fellows were disappointed President Trump had lost reelection, but were holding out hope that John F.

Let me be clear: I am the commander-in-chief’s very special boy, and I will continue in this role for four more years. I’ve already filed a lawsuit to halt the installation of any other person in my position and, if necessary, will pursue this matter all the way to the Supreme Court.” At press time, the U.S. Supreme Court had issued a summary judgment declaring that the last person to claim the post of president’s oldest son had never officially stepped down, and thus the role still rightfully belonged to George W.

Now, we understand that was a grave mistake, and it’s our job to turn things around. Joseph Biden must go. The president-elect is out of control.

Ugh, why does the single best piece of news this country has had in years have to be tainted immediately?

Nation Sees Fundamental Realignment In Which Voting Demographics Should Be Demonized,N/A,https://www.theonion.com/nation-sees-fundamental-realignment-in-which-voting-dem-1845575571,"WASHINGTON—Describing the previous night’s results as a shocking transformation in their understanding of the electorate, political analysts told reporters Wednesday night that the 2020 election represented a fundamental realignment in which voting demographics should be demonized. “Frankly, these results reveal nothing less than a massive sea change of who political parties blame for all of this nation’s problems,” said Stanford University polling expert Harry Mills, noting the Republican Party’s historic steps towards creating a diverse multiracial coalition would have repercussions for decades to come in how it alters the understanding of electoral scapegoats. “Of course, liberal politicians have been edging toward blaming Cubans and Jewish Americans for their problems for years. But no one ever expected they would be able to vilify them so quickly—and certainly not alongside such a broad assortment of minority strawmen like Black men and homosexuals. Where once it was common sense that Democrats only needed to say non-college-educated whites were bigots voting against their own self-interest, it now seems they’ll also need to pin electoral failures on Hispanics who refuse to use the term Latinx. It’s a stunning development.” At press time, the Democratic Party had used preliminary analyses of the election’s outcome to draft a series of outcomes telling Latinos how badly they had botched the election for the rest of us."

Hopefully, all six are confirmed and sitting on the bench before the American people have their say at the polls.” At press time, all six conservative justices had been confirmed to the Supreme Court and Republican senators had announced they were going to try to fit in 10 more spontaneous confirmations before  election day."

Veterans Affairs Secretary Struggling To Profit Off Of Underfunded Department,N/A,https://www.theonion.com/veterans-affairs-secretary-struggling-to-profit-off-of-1845484636,"WASHINGTON—Blaming the chronic lack of resources for hampering his ability to run the agency the way he wanted, Secretary of Veterans Affairs Robert Wilkie told reporters Monday that he was struggling to profit off of his underfunded department. “When I took this job, I really didn’t expect that there would be so little funding going to veteran care that it’s basically impossible to skim millions of dollars off the top,” said Wilkie, adding that he left a lucrative position in the private sector because he believed that working in the Veterans Affairs department would allow him to rake in some quick cash for himself and his friends. “Frankly, I was just going to slash funding for healthcare and community care and redirect that money into outrageously overpriced consulting gigs, but Congress has spent so many years depriving veterans of funding that there’s basically nothing left to gut. As it is, I can barely cobble together the cash for a single private jet ride—and that’s only going one way. When I talk to other Trump appointees like [Education Secretary] Betsy DeVos and [Transportation Secretary] Elaine Chao and hear about the easy money they get from their golden-goose agencies, I can’t help but wonder why our government is okay with leaving the leaders of the Veterans Committee out in the cold.” Wilkie also expressed concerns that he hadn’t made it clear enough in previous budget requests that none of the money would be actually going to veterans."

It’s true that we hoped to get the puzzle done faster when we started in June, but even working on it day and night, it takes time to assemble so many pieces. There are still some sticking points, like whether a few of the border pieces are lost for good or whether they’re just in a couch cushion somewhere in the Oval Office, but as soon as we find those and finish the cypress tree, we’ll be all ready to present it to the public.” Pelosi and Mnuchin admitted that it still might be hard to reach an agreement with Senate Republicans, who so far had rejected the offers of doing a puzzle entirely and seemed unlikely to agree to anything except a game of Risk."

You said a lot of nasty, inconsiderate things two days ago, and now I know exactly how I’m going to respond.

Trust me, they’re going to be completely disgusted by what they watch.” At press time, Welker interrupted Trump to say that the time allotted to him had elapsed."

I’m sorry, sir, but that’s where we’re at.” The Democratic candidate concluded the evening with a stirring warning that Trump’s lack of composure only helped show more than ever why a Biden cabinet would instead be stocked with honest Americans like William Barr and Rudolph Giuliani."

But there’s no getting around the fact that the economy is hurting, and the best way to help is by mandating that all Americans send money to senators and the Pentagon directly. This was also a bipartisan effort, a compromise reached after Democrats wanted you to send $1,600 and Republicans wanted you to send $1,200. We hope that during this difficult time, all Americans will appreciate that extra $1,200 out of their pocketbooks and into our hands.” The stimulus bill also reportedly includes significant provisions targeted at helping small businesses close."
