Democrats Respond To Jacksonville Shooting With Proposal To Remove Black People From Circulation,N/A,https://www.theonion.com/democrats-respond-to-jacksonville-shooting-with-proposa-1850780964,"WASHINGTON—Following a Jacksonville, FL mass shooting in which a white assailant killed three African Americans, Democrats in the U.S. Senate introduced a bill Monday they said would address the continuing crisis of racially motivated attacks by removing all Black people from circulation. “The only way to prevent Black lives from being cut short by these hateful killers is to drastically reduce the number of Black people allowed in public places, where it is far too easy for them to be shot at,” a visibly moved Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said of the proposed measure, which his Republican opponents claimed would do little to remove the nearly 42 million Black Americans already on the street, arguing that if “a criminal is dead set on getting his hands on a Black person, he’ll find one—legally or otherwise.” “We have to start somewhere, and right now our priority should be making it as hard as possible for virulent racists like the Jacksonville shooter to access the Black people they’re trying to murder. Look at a country like South Korea, Japan, Poland, or Iceland, where shootings like this are very rare—that’s because there are so few Black people for would-be killers to target in the first place. I’m not naïve. I know this piece of legislation would only be the first step in controlling the spread of Black people, but a national registry is the simplest, most straight-forward way to keep track of the American Americans in our communities.” Schumer went on to outline a comprehensive buy-back program that would allow any American to turn in a Black person for a cash payment, no questions asked."
Body Language Expert Explains All Republican Debate Participants Just Finished Having Sex With Each Other,N/A,https://www.theonion.com/body-language-expert-explains-all-republican-debate-par-1850770810,"MILWAUKEE—Analyzing the behavior on display during Wednesday night’s Republican presidential debate, a body language expert explained that the eight candidates who participated in the event had all just finished having sex with each other before they walked out on the stage. “It’s obvious from how many of them had messy hair, unbuttoned shirts, and loosened ties that they had all recently engaged in hot, sweaty, and vigorous group sex,” said body language specialist Jared Trujillo, who added that his 25 years of studying nonverbal communication made him adept at registering small things like the hickeys on Chris Christie’s neck and the cigarette in Doug Burgum’s hand. “Viewers at home may have noticed Asa Hutchinson’s laid-back swagger or Tim Scott’s continual need to cuddle, not to mention the used condom stuck to Ron DeSantis’ shoe and the enormous cum stains on Vivek Ramaswamy’s pants. If you look closely at the debate footage, you can even see that Nikki Haley, whose dress was on backward, was holding her heels in one hand while ordering an Uber with the other.” Trujillo went on to state that by watching Mike Pence’s lips carefully, he could tell the former vice president was both praying for forgiveness and had recently eaten ass."

Help! Help!

Tim Scott, you’re good to go. Nikki Haley, I’m going to have to ask you to leave. Per GOP rules, you are not permitted to state your gender as ‘female’ and then enter the debate wearing a pantsuit.” At press time, Donald Trump, who refused to participate in the debate, argued that as a former president of the United States, his genital inspection should remain classified."

Best Strategies From Ron DeSantis’ Leaked Debate Memo,N/A,https://www.theonion.com/best-strategies-from-ron-desantis-leaked-debate-memo-1850758973,"A leaked memo from the Never Back Down super PAC provided a  helpful plan of action for Gov. Ron DeSantis to follow during Wednesday night’s debate. The Onion examines the best strategies  from the document. Voters love a well-lubricated mouth! If you start to get nervous, just run. Any direction, as fast as you can. It’s much better than having to stomach you trying to say something. If you aren’t willing to suffer, then do you even love the United States? Word choice is very important when referring to minority communities, and the term “Black” ensures everyone knows what you mean. (They kind of lost their temper here.) If you can hit all the high notes in this classic of the mezzo-soprano repertoire, then no one—absolutely no one—is going to question your right to be on that stage. A bona fide crowd-pleaser. Keep it chill, like you’re cruisin’ on the strip with your top down, shades on at night, the flashing city lights dancing to the infectious rhythms of the funky beat. You’re outta sight, jack, you’re outta sight. Better to let it all out in the bathroom afterwards than to give Vivek Ramaswamy the satisfaction of seeing how badly his words hurt you. A list of possible words DeSantis could use includes “when,” “made,” “but,” and “buckle.” The memo recommends the 2024 candidate attack the production company behind such films as Geostorm and Transformers: Rise Of The Beasts at least three to five times throughout the evening. Everyone hates it when you laugh. Reminding the audience that he is still turgid every 15 to 30 seconds with a well-placed “I’m hard, by the way” or “Yup, still hard” will help the governor combat perceptions that he is weak. You don’t want to be labeled “Milky DeSantis” by rivals. Should you ever get overwhelmed by opponents bringing up your flagging poll numbers, simply start snapping and vocalizing nonsense syllables in time, getting louder and louder until everyone else goes quiet. Then you can take center stage and begin dancing around wildly! Remember that saying what is honest from deep down is always the right move. Just be your authentic self, and the right people will resonate with your message! Safety first! If you get nervous, you can piss your pants, but only make a little dot. Don’t let it be so much that it goes down your leg, allowing the other candidates to see or smell it. You did such a good job memorizing them, so if you get cornered, you can begin listing every U.S. state capital to show you’re more intelligent than your opponents. The PAC was hopeful that putting on a sexy British accent would make DeSantis sound smarter as well as distract from his overall appearance. Although a large, man-sized Mickey Mouse will be sitting in the debate audience staring directly at DeSantis and breathing heavily, the governor is not to make eye contact. Ultimately, the easiest way to connect with GOP voters. DeSantis was instructed to show dominance by walking up to his opponent, inhaling, and swallowing Ramaswamy in one fell swoop. According to the memo, DeSantis should make a fist, repeatedly punch himself in the face, and then scream, “An undocumented did this! An undocumented did this!” Even though he’s an opponent, DeSantis is only to refer to Trump as “our Heavenly Father” or “the one true God.” Christians Explain Why Jesus Was Too Liberal Everything Trump Did In Georgia To Try To Overturn The 2020 Election Conservatives Explain Why Libraries Should Be Defunded  Homepage"

The Onion asked Trump supporters why they posted the jurors’ personal information online, and this is why they said. “Obviously, if people are gonna murder them, an address would be handy.” “They made the mistake of having an address.” “I feel left out that I haven’t been charged for a crime yet.” “What can I say? I love connecting people.” “I know Trump would do the same for me if our roles were reversed.” “I think it’s cowardly to not at least be open to having a healthy debate on your doorstep with a complete stranger in the middle of the night.” “I figured I’d never get in trouble since Democrats fired every cop in America and replaced them with DEI officers.” “Well, I’m open to other ideas for intimidating current and future jurors.” “They need to know that they can’t just get away with examining the evidence and presenting a decision in accordance with the law.” “This is the most fun Truth Social has ever been, and I’m not supposed to participate?” “I just bet it makes Mr. Trump feel real good to know he’s got somebody out there on his side. Like, he’s up in that magnificent home of his, and he’s thinking, ‘Man, I’ve got it all, but it’s nothing compared to what Mr. Crenshaw has done for me.’ Because it turns out, he knows me! He knows my name! He’s even got a picture of me on his desk. Me! Little old Joshie Crenshaw! And just thinking about that makes me turn off the car engine and open the garage door and know I’ve got a reason to face another day.” “I’m incredibly jealous of all of them as someone who has never been described as a ‘grand’ anything.” “I’m just really hoping it inspires one of them to doxx me back.” “Whoa, whoa, all I did was retweet someone else’s grotesque violation of those people’s privacy.” “Well, we all know the president’s address, so it only seemed fair.” “Wanted to send a message that would make them think twice about indicting Donald Trump, a message that, in hindsight, probably would’ve worked better prior to them and three other grand juries handing down indictments.” “I did crime to get Trump out of his crime.

Ron DeSantis Booed Off Stage After Flashing His Stomach,N/A,https://www.theonion.com/ron-desantis-booed-off-stage-after-flashing-his-stomach-1850735733,"DES MOINES, IA—Triggering an ear-splitting backlash from voters gathered at the Iowa State Fair, Ron DeSantis was reportedly booed off stage this week after flashing his stomach on stage. Several reports indicated that DeSantis stopped speaking mid-sentence at the campaign event to lift his shirt into the air, silently exposing the entirety of his plump abdomen to the crowd of Republican voters, who immediately began heckling the candidate. According to eye witness accounts, the Florida governor attempted to regain control of the room by giving his stomach a single enthusiastic slap, which only further provoked the furious crowd to take off their own shirts, ball up the garments, and pelt  the candidate, screaming “Cover up, freak” and “We want Trump’s tummy.” At press time, the DeSantis campaign had issued a statement clarifying that the candidate was trying to communicate that he was hungry to end wokeness."
Everything Trump Did In Georgia To Try To Overturn The 2020 Election,N/A,https://www.theonion.com/everything-trump-did-in-georgia-to-try-to-overturn-the-1850736638,"Despite audits finding no evidence of fraud in the 2020 election, Donald Trump allegedly pressured Georgia officials to meddle with ballots and spread conspiracy theories about the election’s validity. The Onion examines everything Trump did in Georgia to try to overturn the 2020 election. What a fucking pathetic excuse for an autocrat. While he’s not strictly responsible for the racist and classist bipartisan effort to curb democracy, he did a pretty thorough job coasting on it. He was forced to seek alternative measures due to long response times from police. Sadly, the fast-food chain was only able to provide him with around 200. The de-voting fluid may have caused as many as 30 pen-filled bubble votes to evaporate. Trump was apparently misled t0 believe that marrying the governor means you automatically win the state. “I Am President, I Am President, I Am President.” Although both architects of the 9/11 attacks were confirmed dead decades ago, that didn’t stop Trump from trying to damage Atlanta DA Fani Willis’ reputation. Reaching a point of desperation, Trump decided to make an ill-advised purchase of a macaque from Malaysia and tried for days to instruct the monkey on how to identify which ballots were votes for Biden so he could steal them. Although the compromising photos of the voting machine were later discredited, the damage had already been done. Trump vowed that if Georgia pulled through for him, he would declassify all the secret government files about the shadowy figure we know as “George Washington.” His efforts were appreciated, but they had already cast their ballots. Luckily, they were pro–Grover Cleveland ballots from the election of 1884. Trump repeatedly pressured the media mogul to “find more votes” despite Perry repeatedly explaining that the BET series The Oval is pure fiction. Shows how serious he was about staying president. Even though Trump didn’t necessarily truly believe  this would have any bearing on the election results, he hedged his bets by explaining to his sons that committing a sin of the flesh would take away votes from their father. Even though he passed out before they blew off the table, his intention was the same. After hearing about what complete sluts Dominion voting machines are, Trump figured he could set up a little quid pro quo arrangement to secure his win. He was really laying on the potential bribes thick. After everything he did to undermine the democratic process, Trump realized that he didn’t truly have to do anything, and that just being the immoral, spiteful demagogue he was would always be enough to erode fairness within the U.S. It’s unclear how this would have helped his quest for the U.S. presidency, but he was arrested for trespassing on the property several times nonetheless. Prohibited under Chapter 183-1 of the Georgia Election Code. He didn’t find anything that would have helped him overturn the election, but had a lot of fun just looking around regardless. Trump claimed the only real Biden on the ballot was him. Ouch. Unfortunately, Trump is still coming into his powers and lacks the mental strength necessary to move thousands of ballots with his mind. While almost certainly illegal, feasting on volunteers likely only had localized effects. Trump was smart to reach out to the shadowy GOP operatives who successfully stopped the count in Florida, but he may not have been persistent enough. Although the then-senator would have still voted for him, Trump reportedly wanted to make extra sure the vote was received. Trump reportedly created a diversion for Rudy Giuliani to copy confidential data from voting machines by walking into a police office in downtown Atlanta and confessing to kidnapping Charles Lindbergh in 1932. This was mostly to make fun of Jared Kushner, but the authorities decided to  include it in the Georgia indictment as a hate crime. Donald Trump personally jerked off all 5 million adult male residents of the state of Georgia and was disappointed to discover that it did not immediately secure their votes.

And this  is just the beginning. Israel knows that if they normalize ties with the  Saudis, that raises the likelihood of other Gulf States joining them in  killing and maiming Palestinians.” At press time, Israel had reportedly  attempted to show its seriousness by beheading a journalist reporting  on the deal for an American newspaper."

By the end of the conversation, it was clear he’d secured the corn dog’s vote.

Republicans Explain Why Trump Is Innocent,N/A,https://www.theonion.com/republicans-explain-why-trump-is-innocent-1850705405,"Following the former president’s third indictment, The Onion asked Republicans to explain why Donald Trump is innocent, and this is what they said. ”Eyewitnesses, verified text messages, recorded phone calls, physical evidence, his own confessions caught on tape—It’s just not enough to go on.” “I mean, personally I stopped trying to employ any type of logic to explain my pro-Trump position a long time ago.” “President Dad IMPOTENT!!!” “Hey, there are two sides to every story, and women are liars. That’s what this is about, right?” “This is all just a deep-state Democratic plot to distract me while I’m driving so I commit crimes like manslaughter and leaving the scene of an accident!” “Have we truly grown so cynical that a man’s word isn’t enough?” “Donald Trump came to me in a dream and told me that not only is he innocent, but that I am his one true successor.” “He doesn’t have the ridges that characterize the skull shape of a criminal.” “He’s covered under the same constitutional right that says a beautiful lady cannot get a traffic ticket.” “Commiting a crime or two doesn’t mean you’re not innocent.” “I’m not sure you can be found guilty for trying to subvert democracy when we don’t live in a democracy? That’s like getting arrested for vehicular manslaughter after hitting a mannequin.” “Would a guilty man sweat so profusely? I don’t think so.” “Allow me to explain my position using a witch hunt metaphor.” “The Founding Fathers in their infinite wisdom wrote in the constitution that Trump wasn’t guilty.” “I hope they toss him in jail and throw away the key. And then I find the key and let him out and he’s so, so grateful that he let’s me use his golden shitter.” “After seeing that he makes surprise pop-ins at Mar-A-Lago events, I paid huge money to host my birthday party there. That way, my crush, who is a huge fan of him, would definitely come. If he goes to jail and doesn’t show up, I’m never going to get a smooch.” “Surprisingly, he came into my confessional and I absolved him of his sins. Thus he is innocent in the eyes of the Lord.” “I did his roof. Didn’t see anything guilty happening through the hole.” “If President Trump guilty of anything, it’s of being a damn good golfer who committed treason.” “I am less interested in why Trump is innocent, and more why Trump is at all.” “Pops, you mean? My ol’ pops? Guilty? Aw, go on now. Shucks. He ain’t done nothing.” “Trust me. He’s innocent.” “Title 18 § 371 of the U.S. Criminal Code is obviously a slut who’s just lying for attention.” “I screened him for guilt and it came up negative.

The Onion Explains ‘Bidenomics’,N/A,https://www.theonion.com/the-onion-explains-bidenomics-1850701243,"President Biden seems poised to make “Bidenomics”—a raft of economic legislation passed during his term, as well as future proposals—the centerpiece of his reelection campaign, arguing that the U.S. economy is strong. But is it really? The Onion answers the most important questions about Bidenomics and its effects on regular Americans. Q: What is “Bidenomics”? A: A term as vague, ineffective, and meaningless as you’d expect from a Democratic administration. Q: How will this legislation help everyday Americans? A: Proponents of Bidenomics estimate the average American will save as many as .07 seconds combining the words “Biden” and “economics.”  Q: What’s the most essential element of Bidenomics? A: Basically, any positive part of the current economy is Bidenomics, and any negatives, those are not Bidenomics.  Q: Why is the president making Bidenomics such a central point of his reelection campaign? A: Some other guy already took his idea of building a wall between the United States and Mexico. Q: I’m poor. How will Bidenomics help me? A: That depends. Do you run a computer chip manufacturing plant? Q: What are some economic wins under the Biden administration? A: Fewer banks need bailouts, all PPP loans have been forgiven, and the average American CEO is seeing more drilling profits than ever.  Q: What are some of the key indicators of Bidenomics? A: Green lines up, red lines down.  Q: How has Bidenomics impacted the cost of prescription drugs? A: The drugs your insurance plan doesn’t cover are cheaper now. Q: Is focusing on his economic policies a good reelection strategy for Biden?  A: It’s rarely ever smart to hitch your wagon to the state of America. Q: If the economy is so good, why is everyone I know struggling?  A: Those people don’t count."

DeSantis is the one whom Americans could best picture sitting at the end of a bar by himself and avoiding eye contact with anyone else except when he needs to order another drink,” said Pew spokesperson Kevin Neeley, who noted that approximately two-thirds of poll respondents stated that they could easily visualize the two-term governor and former congressman staring into his half-empty beer glass and letting out a long sigh as his visibly forced smile drained from his face. “What this tells us is that voters see DeSantis as the sort of guy who could really just spend a whole evening nursing a Heineken alone in a dark corner of a bar. Maybe he tries to strike up a conversation with a group of regulars and then realizes no one heard him and so he lapses into dead silence again. Really, this is some of the best news his campaign could hope for at this point.” The poll also showed that Trump remained the candidate voters could most imagine getting drinks with a Ku Klux Klan grand dragon.

Did Hunter Biden rent an Airbnb with a fireplace for the weekend? Did Hunter Biden’s session involve nearly a dozen costume changes along with a professional hair and makeup team? No, because he is nothing but a corrupt pervert.” At press time, Greene added that Hunter Biden’s photographs were barely titillating. "

Flexing your elbows ever so slightly while you lower yourself half an inch toward the ground is not a fucking push-up. Anyone unwilling to switch political parties for personal gain has no business becoming president. Federal law states that all executions must be carried out by lethal injection. RFK Jr. is almost definitely not the guy on money. If this is true, then why are most gorillas under 6 feet tall? Get this lunatic back to the asylum. Jesus, just say where the bathroom is. That’s all he said, but we didn’t like his tone. Thankfully, he did such a good job that it’s not a problem anymore, freeing him up to worry about things like cancel culture and deplatforming. He also repeatedly claimed that Yosemite caused autism. Yeah, right. He’s repeatedly claimed the bullet that killed his father was Jewish, making the same claim about the bullet that killed his uncle JFK and the small plane that killed his cousin JFK Jr. He was simply quoting the distinguished pediatric neurologist Jenny McCarthy. To be fair, he said this while very tired and staring at a can of Red Bull. Everyone knows JFK was killed by the polio vaccine. While wrongheaded and antisemitic, it seems like it’s a really important part of his understanding of his family’s lore. The most attractive Kennedy was Joseph Kennedy Sr. and everyone knows it.

Once the financial situation improves, we could possibly hire her back  as a part-time spousal contractor to pose for photos as DeSantis’ wife every now and then, but right now her role is not economically feasible.” Peck added that the campaign was already looking to replace DeSantis’ children with cheaper migrant labor."

Whether it’s accepting illicit campaign contributions, using official government resources for campaign purposes, or failing to properly file expenditure reports, we need evidence from news articles, video recordings, or official stationary that the candidate’s campaign is violating federal law in multiple ways. Alternatively, if a candidate is unable to reach the 20,000 campaign ethics violations threshold, we’ll make an exception if they can prove that they’ve personally committed at least a Class X felony embezzlement from their campaign funds.” The RNC also reportedly set as an additional requirement for debate qualification that all candidates must sign a pledge to commit ethics violations on behalf of the eventual Republican nominee."

Most-Homophobic Statements Made By Ron DeSantis,N/A,https://www.theonion.com/most-homophobic-statements-made-by-ron-desantis-1850607108,"Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida is facing backlash for his long history of antigay remarks, both in office and on the presidential campaign trail. The Onion examines some of the most homophobic statements he’s made throughout his career. No, that’s the vaccines, you bigot. Meeting Ron DeSantis is a trauma that no person—regardless of sexuality, gender identity, race, religion, or creed—should ever have to endure. Only a homophobe would draw this distinction. Opposite-sex encounters are the only ones he wants performed in front of children. DeSantis paused after he said this during a speech to open a new building at the Kennedy Space Center and got no applause for it. Not sure where he came up with this one. DeSantis personally thinks Jacksonville is Florida’s paradise. Conservatives denied this was homophobic, but read between the lines and it’s a pretty clear antigay dog whistle. He then went on an expletive-laced screed denouncing woke cetaceans. DeSantis subscribes to the fringe ideology that denies gay identity because there is no evidence in the fossil record of homosexual activity amongst dinosaurs. DeSantis often ends his stump speeches with a laundry list of pop culture gripes. At this point, he’s just trying to get assassinated. The dates don’t at all line up with DeSantis’ age, but the rest checks out. It should be understood at this point that everything he says is an attack on the LGBTQIA+ community. DeSantis thinks it’s pretty masculine and superior to wear an entire wardrobe that doesn’t flatter one’s figure. Hateful because it’s an unfortunate truth we all have to live with.

A lot of people forget Mr. Cain was our party’s frontrunner in the 2012 race until he was sidelined by accusations of sexual misconduct, something that is no longer an impediment to a Republican seeking public office. And polls show swing voters and independents are more likely to see him as a sympathetic figure since his tragic death three years ago.” A Quinnipiac University Poll released earlier this week found that nine in 10 registered voters described Cain as only “slightly less alive” than President Joe Biden."

A small contingent even worried the presidents would make jokes about them being on the toilet to fellow patrons. These are bleak results for the frontrunners heading into 2024—some of the lowest since the 1980 election, when most thought they would leave the bathroom to find Jimmy Carter wandering over and finishing their half-eaten sandwich.” The Pew poll did find, however, that many Americans would settle for Trump or Biden if the other clientele at the café were Ron DeSantis, Chris Christie, or Marianne Williamson."

Think of the party!” said an apparition of the 35th president who is visible only to Feinstein and has served as her top aide since he entered her hospital room last month, trailing behind him the endless brain tissue that continually oozes from a wound in his skull. “There is nothing left for you in the Senate, Dianne, or indeed in this earthly realm. Soon you will carry out the ultimate service to your country by joining me on the other side. And together, we will govern the afterlife!” At press time, Feinstein told sources she felt betrayed after discovering the phantasm of Kennedy was merely angling to be appointed to her vacant Senate seat."
Politicians Explain Why They Oppose Gender-Affirming Care,N/A,https://www.theonion.com/politicians-explain-why-they-oppose-gender-affirming-ca-1850313268,"At least 13 states have passed laws banning gender-affirming care for trans youth, including life-saving treatments like hormone therapy and puberty blockers. The Onion asked politicians why they oppose gender-affirming care, and this is what they said. “I consider it sexual abuse, and I’ve decided I suddenly care about that.” “Whether you were born male or female, I’m opposed to the existence of genitals in all their forms.” “Seems like an easy way to annoy everyone who voted for me.” “To fulfill my pathological need to exert power over our society’s most vulnerable, obviously. Dumb question.” “It’s not up to young people to decide what gender they are. It’s up to my campaign donors.” “No child should ever be affirmed about anything, ever.” “None of my girlfriends have been mature enough to make such a life-altering decision.” “Allowing someone to feel comfortable and confident in their own body is something I’ve opposed since the beginning of my career.” “It gives the inaccurate impression that doctors do more than just prescribe opiates.” “It is a fact that the first sign of child abuse is a kid liking themselves.” “It’s unnatural for a teenager to alter their body in a way that makes me not attracted to them.” “There hasn’t been a single pro-gender-affirming lobbyist even trying to throw millions at me.” “Anything to keep voters’ attention off my state’s poverty, crime, economy, drug problems, schools, and police departments.” “That sounds suspiciously like healthcare.” “I believe in a small government that inspects children’s genitals.” “If we let people be themselves, what next? Anyone can grow a beard? No one needs to buy a fake beard? I have to find another way to unload this warehouse full of beards?” “You lost me at gender, then again at affirming, and finally at care.”"
Most Inflammatory Things Trump Has Said Since Being Indicted,N/A,https://www.theonion.com/most-inflammatory-things-trump-has-said-since-being-ind-1850303619,"Following his recent arrests, former President Donald Trump has made a number of provocative remarks. The Onion examines the most inflammatory things Trump has said since being indicted. Supporters were baffled and slightly disappointed by the former president’s request for this gentle act of protest. Careful with the base, there, Donny. Trump has maintained he was born in 2018. Prominent people aren’t supposed to say things like this, because people might actually listen to them. Disgusting. Although two for one seemed like a fair trade, the Manhattan district attorney apparently did not agree. There is no justice left regardless. This is an insult to the thousands of hardworking reporters who have appeared on these networks covering this story over the past several days. Um, not without seeing your certification in proper canning methods for safe and effective food preservation, Mr. President. Shrieked while standing at the top of a flight of stairs as a stroller holding Barron rolled down toward the busy street. No one is trying to make him do this. He meant Deep State, and seems to have simply misspoke. He shouldn’t have mentioned this. While technically true, his tone wasn’t great. This is what Trump says to Barron whenever Barron wants to hang out. Trump said this after dropping his calzone. With statements like this, some have become concerned that Trump may be a narcissist. While The Bends may include many great songs, as a composed album it doesn’t even come close to reaching the artistic highs of OK Computer. The former president should have consulted with his lawyer before he ballooned out his cheeks and tried to imitate a clown fish in the fish tank on his desk. Then what was he doing as president? Illegal things are what the voters elected him to do. Shouted at the moment of climax. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Did he say “Blacks”? Yeesh. Alvin Bragg is a certified cutie pie. Uttered right as the nation finally got a different song stuck in their heads. Animal crackers in soup sounds gross.

I don’t need you to hold me, but you could if you really wanted to. Maybe run your fingers through my hair like mommy used to do when I was a child. Fine I’ll let you hold me, since you want to so badly.” “Look, I already got the gig I wanted, so I really don’t pay attention to politics anymore.” “This leaves me no choice but to be convicted of the same crimes so that I can break him out of prison from the inside.” “Thank God. I was running out of things to talk about in my fundraising emails.” “Of course my shipment of C4 gets delayed right when I need it.” “Jimmy sad because Jimmy no know what’s gonna happen to Trump friend.

Specifically, me choosing whatever is most politically expedient in the moment.” “A woman’s throat is simply too delicate and dainty to be able to swallow a pill.” “Abortion is healthcare, so Americans have no right to it.” “They are highly ineffective.

Spencer Cox, who stressed that the sexual exploitation of teenagers was a very serious matter in Utah and should be carried out exclusively by elders in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. “We believe that intrusive questions about a teen’s sexuality should be asked behind closed doors by a bishop—not on some social media site by a stranger. And when that child is eventually blackmailed into sexual slavery, who better to oversee that process than a man who is highly respected in the community and represents an institution that is beyond reproach?” Cox added that the digital trail of evidence left behind by online predators also made it that much harder to orchestrate a cover-up of the abuse and pretend it never happened."

Sometimes people can get really nasty  about politics. But, aside from a few typos, blood-stains, and the  toxic powder, this really seems to be coming from someone who cares  about these issues and wants to see the country do better.” Williams  added that the biggest shame was that all these interesting points would unfortunately be overshadowed by the three congressional  aides sent to the hospital."

This isn’t merely an egregious violation of basic labor laws.

Tucker Carlson’s Biggest Lies,N/A,https://www.theonion.com/tucker-carlson-s-biggest-lies-1850225955,"While the Fox News host is not necessarily known for being honest, text messages released in the Dominion Voting Systems lawsuit show that Tucker Carlson frequently lies to viewers. The Onion examines Tucker Carlson’s biggest lies. Carlson has repeatedly claimed on-air that the QAnon Shaman had IBS and thus had no choice but to release his bowels all over Nancy Pelosi’s office, and that anyone who disputed this was simply being ableist. Tucker Carlson has been a registered member of the Green Party since 1991. No, there is hope: a young peasant girl from the village, as foretold by the prophecy. Tucker Carlson is a television host. He absolutely would, in a heartbeat. Bow tie cancer is exceedingly rare. This one is actually true. The Capitol building is boring as shit, and in a town with the Lincoln Memorial, the Smithsonian, and the National Gallery of Art, no self-respecting tourist would waste their valuable time sightseeing at the fucking Capitol building. Yet again, Carlson proves himself to be a lib in sheep’s clothing. It was only a shadow, although he did get scared. That was Brian Kilmeade. In fact, Carlson wears the blue, puffy shirt he wore on the program every single night to bed. While Carlson has regularly called for the deportation of illegal immigrants, his repeated attempts to use them to sell hair supplements is just pathetic. Far be it from us to disagree with the Lollipop Man; however, in this instance, he appears to be fibbing. Fauci and the novel coronavirus are work acquaintances and nothing more. He left MSNBC in 2008, not 2007. This one isn’t so much a lie as it is misleading, since it’s odd to single out Trump among the 3.5 million of his viewers he absolutely loathes. While it is unfathomable to think that not one but two people could find Tucker Carlson desirable, this one is true. This is what Fox was covering as the Jan. 6 insurrection took place. Carlson’s assertion that Covid-19 was created in a studio session during a Method Man verse is unsubstantiated. While technically true, it’s not for the reasons Carlson believes. Yet again, Carlson has mistaken himself for peanut butter. Information about the Brazilian three-banded armadillo is widespread and easy to find online. He just never figured out how to use it correctly. Whenever there’s a slow news day, Carlson claims the purple M&M met him when he was just 16 years old and immediately seduced him."

But here in Florida, we know that shoving a baby out of a woman’s vagina is pornographic, and we’re not going to tolerate it.

And why the fuck do I pay for coverage if it doesn’t cover anything? That ambulance ride alone cost a thousand bucks, and of course those assholes drove me to an out-of-network hospital!” Unsure how else to stop racking up medical expenses and becoming an even greater burden to his family, McConnell reportedly threw himself out a hospital window and plummeted to his death."

Take it from us, confining your anti-trans agenda to either willful inaction or silent legislative maneuvers definitely still gets the job done.” At press time, Schumer called on Democrats to continue to sit back, do nothing, and tell their LGBTQIA+ constituents that they were doing everything they could to protect them."

Mark Warner (D-VA), adding that legislative work in the upper chamber of Congress had been brought to a virtual standstill because dozens of senators couldn’t stop scrolling through TikTok videos and bursting into tears. “We wanted to do some research into TikTok to see for ourselves how it threatens public security, but we all ended up addicted to watching weight-loss and dieting TikToks, which made us all feel really bad about our bodies. This app simply makes it far too easy for users, including all 100 United States senators, to develop depression and low self-esteem. Jon Tester (D-MT) just ran off saying he didn’t want to see anyone until he’s lost 20 pounds, Mitt Romney (R-UT) has been in the bathroom for over 90 minutes, and we just watched Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) eat an entire chocolate cake. Both Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and Cindy Hyde Smith (R-MI) have unveiled big visual aids counting their calories, and the hashtag #WhatIEatInADay has been trending around the Senate. Chuck Grassley (R-IA) has been doing crunches on the Senate floor, and Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) is begging us all to follow her weight-loss journey on the app. TikTok is, without a doubt, a growing threat to a functional American society.” At press time, Congress had passed a massive bipartisan funding bill to purchase diet pills they saw on TikTok.

"Stable, Content Woman Only Has A Few Months Left Before Thinking About Ron DeSantis Every Day",N/A,https://www.theonion.com/stable-content-woman-only-has-a-few-months-left-before-1850185358,"SPOKANE, WA—Letting out a gratified, peaceful sigh as she sipped her morning coffee, local stable, content woman Gina Dore reportedly remained unaware Monday that she only had a few months left before she would be thinking about Ron DeSantis every day. According to sources, Dore was blissfully able to go about her afternoon despite being only 60 or so days out from hearing the governor of Florida’s name dozens of times an hour, whether it would be overheard on public transportation, from argumentative pundits referencing him on the news, or from her own mouth as she expressed her derision over his politics. Sources confirmed that, for now, the serene woman was free to think about whatever she liked, as her mind would not be 100 percent preoccupied by reckoning with the phrase “President DeSantis” for another several news cycles, at which point she would be immediately bombarded with his opinions on the issues facing the nation from the moment she woke up in the morning until she tried and failed to fall asleep at night. Despite being mere weeks away from being plunged into a sea of thinkpieces, photographs, and sound bites centered on the Republican, the happy, satisfied woman was reportedly able to concentrate fully on work for the last time before her current placidity would come crashing down in a bombardment of hateful and regressive Ron DeSantis campaign ads."
Ron DeSantis Rails Against Woke Pants For Making His Ass Look Huge,N/A,https://www.theonion.com/ron-desantis-rails-against-woke-pants-for-making-his-as-1850185116,"TALLAHASSEE, FL—During a rally in which he decried the cut of his suit as yet another example of political correctness run amok, Florida governor and likely presidential candidate Ron DeSantis railed against his own pants Friday, blaming the woke garment for making his ass look huge. “These pernicious navy slacks, with their woke and evil agenda, have conspired to make my ass appear very, very fat, and I won’t stand for it,” said DeSantis, claiming that the pants flagrantly trampled upon his First Amendment right to show off his butt in the sexiest and most flattering manner possible. “I mean, what is the world coming to when radical liberal tailors can conspire to make what should be a nice, juicy booty look enormous and disgusting instead. If they think they can indoctrinate children into thinking I have anything other than a shapely-if-hefty backside, then they have another think coming.” At press time, DeSantis had signed an executive order banning all pants in the state of Florida."

CPAC To Feature Exhibit Where Visitors Can Toss Raw Chicken To Rudy Giuliani,N/A,https://www.theonion.com/cpac-to-feature-exhibit-where-visitors-can-toss-raw-chi-1850179621,"WASHINGTON—Advertising the event as a chance to interact personally with a conservative icon, organizers confirmed Thursday that the 2023 Conservative Political Action Conference would feature a new exhibit where visitors could purchase and toss pieces of raw chicken to Rudy Giuliani. “This year, for $5 a pop, attendees will be treated to an up-close encounter with the former mayor of New York and given a thrilling opportunity to feed him a handful of his favorite food—raw chicken,” CPAC spokesperson Nancy Garner said as she stood outside a 9-by-12-foot enclosure that contained a warming lamp, a sunning rock, a water feature, artificial plants, and the disgraced onetime U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York. “Can you see him? Those are his heavy-lidded, bloodshot eyes peeking out from under that rock. He may look harmless now, but don’t be fooled. He’s still feral. Be sure to step back as soon as you release the chicken, because he’s going to leap forward and grab it with a big jowly chomp before it even hits the ground. And if you think that’s neat, watch what happens when you throw a few airplane bottles of blended scotch into the cage! Video is allowed, but please refrain from flash photography, as he is quite old and easily disoriented. That’s how Kelly Anne Conway was bitten earlier.” At press time, CPAC was reportedly on lockdown after Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) left the door open while attempting to get a selfie inside the Giuliani tank."
